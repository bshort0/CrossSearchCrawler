In order to achieve the classification, Intrusion detection systems use software computing techniques including neural networks and neuro fuzzy networks to categorize network activities and specify what category of attack is being generated. Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results. Genetic algorithms use a set of genetic operators such as mutation, crossover and selection on current population to reproduce similar patterns that will be used repeatedly until a particular criterion is met.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888688","ANFIS;Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neuro-Fuzy","Biological cells;Filtering;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Training","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;security of data","ANFIS;IDS systems;data classification;fuzzy inference systems;genetic algorithms;intelligent intrusion detection system;neural networks;neuro-fuzzy classifiers;software computing techniques","","0","","20","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost communication and computing devices connected to sensor nodes which sense physical parameters. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time. The proposed research work uses biological inspirations and machine learning techniques for adding security against such threats. While it uses machine learning techniques to identify the fraudulent nodes, consecutively by deriving inspiration from human immune system it effectively nullify the impact of the fraudulent ones on the network.

Intelligent CCTV system in public place will monitor human behavior in real-time and transfer image data to control tower for the security purpose. In this paper, we propose an abnormal behavioral tracking model for prediction of abnormal situation by using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm combined with Viterbi algorithm.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event. We evaluate various machine learning methods as disturbance discriminators and discuss the practical implications for deploying machine learning systems as an enhancement to existing power system architectures.","","","","10.1109/ISRCS.2014.6900095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900095","SCADA;Smart grid;cyber-attack;machine learning","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Protocols;Relays;Smart grids","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system faults;security of data","cyber-attack discrimination;machine learning;power system architectures;power system disturbance;power system operators","","1","","37","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system.

By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2396994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042739","Bayesian attack graph model;critical infrastructure protection;cyber security;cyber-physical systems;power system reliability;supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system","Local area networks;Protocols;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Substations","Bayes methods;SCADA systems;belief networks;local area networks;power grids;power system reliability;power system security;security of data","Bayesian attack graph model;IEEE reliability test system;SCADA cybersecurity consideration;communication link;information and communication network;intelligent electronic device;load probability;local area network;mean time-to-compromise model;power grid;power system reliability evaluation;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","0","","31","","2015-02-16","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test.

These on demand service facilities provide to its consumers in multitenant environment but as facility increases complexity and security problems also increase. Here all the resources are at one place in data centers. Cloud uses public and private APIs (Application Programming Interface) to provide services to its consumers in multitenant environment. In this environment Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), especially HTTP, XML or REST based DDoS attacks may be very dangerous and may provide very harmful effects for availability of services and all consumers will get affected at the same time. One other reason is that because the cloud computing users make their request in XML then send this request using HTTP protocol and build their system interface with REST protocol such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure. So the threaten coming from distributed REST attacks are more and easy to implement by the attacker, but to security expert very difficult to resolve. So to resolve these attacks this paper introduces a comber approach for security services called filtering tree. This filtering tree has five filters to detect and resolve XML and HTTP DDoS attack.","","978-1-4673-1516-6","","10.1109/SCEECS.2012.6184829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184829","Cloud Computing;Distributed Denial of Service Attacks;IaaS;Network security;Paas;REST;SaaS","Cloud computing;Computer crime;IP networks;Matched filters;Simple object access protocol;XML","XML;application program interfaces;cloud computing;security of data;transport protocols","Amazon EC2;Distributed Denial Of Service Attack;HTTP DDoS attack;HTTP protocol;Microsoft Azure;XML DDoS attack;application programming interface;cloud computing protection;comber approach;infrastructure as a service;multitenant environment;platform as a service;software as a service","","2","","23","","","1-2 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The artificial immune algorithm can efficiently detect abnormal access request of storage area network, so the two-layered access control is presented for storage area network. The structure of two-layered access control is given, it contains two kinds of modules such as the top access control module in metadata server and the lower access control module in intelligent disk. The distribution strategy for two-layered access control is presented. The top access control module in metadata server generates all detectors and preserves a majority of them. The lower access control module preserves a small number of detectors. Then it realizes a network access request inspection strategy with a center of top access control module. The number-type detector is used to instead of binary string detector and the numerical-type detector generating algorithm is given, they are used to avoid binary string detector enumeration and access request inspection by bit.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","2","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","","978-0-7695-4879-1","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose Predictive Mutual Information (PMI), a hybrid measure of relevance not only is based on MI but also accounts for predictability of signals from one another as in KCCA. We show that PMI has more improved feature detection capability than MI and KCCA, especially in catching suspicious coincidences that are rare but potentially important not only for subsequent experimental studies but also for building computational predictive models which is demonstrated on two toy datasets and a real intrusion detection system dataset.","1051-4651","978-1-4244-7542-1","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.1060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597870","","Accuracy;Biomedical measurements;Correlation;Entropy;Joints;Kernel;Mutual information","correlation theory;entropy;feature extraction;operating system kernels;security of data;statistical analysis","KCCA;PMI;feature selection algorithm;information entropy;intrusion detection system;kernel canonical correlation analysis;nonlinear correlation measure;predictive mutual information","","1","","9","","","23-26 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications.

The proposed XML-based generic signature format set is designed to be extensible, and therefore it should be easy to incorporate new features in the future.

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X","978-1-4673-0714-7","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, this model is insensitive to network scale so it is adaptable to large-scale network. Second, response rate depends mostly on peer's degree.

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network. This cryptographic is highly secure which uses a distinct classified digital key which can be generated dynamically using the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm. This technique can ensure that data is securely transmitted in a reliable manner.

The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems. The proposed approach facilitates analyzing these problems associated with complex SOA systems through the message-store analysis. We consider that the application of computer forensics to the message store in SOA helps the system administrator to identify and fix various problems.

Moreover, analyzing the determinant and major attributes are highly recommended. In this research is implemented the combined Classification methods between Regression Tree method (CART) and Random Forest (RF) to build the classification model that is used in the early detection of diabetes mellitus type II disease. Those methods are selected based on the characteristics of the dataset used in medical records that consist of complex attributes consisting of several categorical attributes and continuous attributes, besides the advantages of the CART models are easy to implement, and it can explore the structure of complex medical records, while the RF method can handle the problem in accuracy. This research has tested a different number of trees and numbers of candidate attributes splitter. Based on the test results, it shows that the addition of trees and attributes splitter can improve the accuracy and reduce the error rate, with the optimal inputs are 50 numbers of trees and 3 number of attributes splitter with 83,8% average accuracy.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

With virtualization platform administrators tasked with preventing attacks in order to provide uninterrupted service, existing intrusion detection technologies are continuously challenged. Consequently, this paper proposes a Centralized Administration and Dynamic Monitoring framework (CADM) based on virtualization for network intrusion detection. CADM is able to centrally administrate, and monitor network behavior in the virtual computing environment by automatically deploying and updating intrusion detection processes and rules. In the aspect of monitoring capability, CADM allows the monitoring locations in intrusion detection to be automatically adjusted in real time, thus adapting to the dynamic changes (such as migration) of virtual machines (VMs). Moreover, the monitoring processes involved in intrusion detection could also be automatically updated by dynamically updating security strategies. In the aspect of monitoring granularity, CADM is able to monitor network interfaces of each virtual machine (VM) for fine-grained network intrusion detection and network traffic acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrate that more convenient and efficient monitoring and administrating capabilities are available with CADM for virtualization platform administrators.","","978-1-4799-2418-9","","10.1109/PDCAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6904241","Centralized Management;Dynamic Update;Network Intrusion Detection;Virtualization Security Monitoring","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","CADM;VM;centralized administration;dynamic monitoring framework;fine-grained network intrusion detection;intrusion detection technologies;monitoring granularity;network traffic acquisition;virtual computing environment;virtual machines;virtual network structure;virtualization platform administrators;virtualization technology","","0","","17","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, the toolkits have low efficacies in matching each packet with all the detection rules to avoid false positives. Unfortunately, there are no automatic functionalities to debug expert systems so that all noisy signatures and rules set that trigger false alerts are isolated. Hence, heuristic methods are wrongly applied in realistic networks. Consequently, there are alarming cases of network attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents an automated approach that enable system administrators to debug network detectors.

In order to encourage selfish nodes to assume the leadership role, some form of incentive mechanism is required. We present an incentive-based leader selection mechanism in which incentives are incorporated in the form of credit transfer to the leader, which motivates nodes to compete with each other for assuming the leadership role. The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism not only increases the overall lifetime of a network, but also decreases the amount of imposed communication overhead on the network in comparison with the traditional leader selection algorithms.","2156-9711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686474","Bargaining game;Incentive mechanism;Leader selection;MANETs;Price-based systems;Self-organizing networks","Ad hoc networks;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Lead;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Protocols","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks","MANETs;bargaining games;battery depletion;communication overhead;incentive-based leader selection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc networks;selfish nodes","","0","","14","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We then provide a numerical design procedure to determine the appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant. We also show how our design procedure can be modified to maintain mean square stability under packet drops in the network.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5717159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5717159","","Actuators;Delay;Linear matrix inequalities;Network topology;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","control system synthesis;linear systems;network topology;networked control systems;radio networks;stability","linear dynamical system;mean square stability;network topology;networked control schemes;wireless control network;wireless nodes","","10","","18","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed tool will utilize Snort rules in the model creation process where a Snort rule is transformed into XML and MSC models. Besides Snort rules, the proposed tool is able to utilize network traffic traces stored in a packet capture format (Pcap). These traces may contain diverse set of different network activities that are relevant in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks.

Compromise of concentrators can be detected. The aggregated data is protected using Chameleon Signatures and then forwarded to the utility back-end for verification, accounting, and analysis. Using the Trapdoor Chameleon Hash Function, the smart meters can periodically send an evidence to the utility back-end, by computing an alternative message and a random value (m', r) such that m' consists of all previous energy usage measurements of the smart meter in a specified period of time. By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters. Any data anomaly between smart meters and concentrators can be detected, thus indicating potential compromise of concentrators.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064626","","Ground penetrating radar;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IP networks;Logic gates;Zigbee","cryptographic protocols;data communication;smart meters;telecommunication security","AMI;advanced metering infrastructure;chameleon signatures;customer billing;delayed-integrity-verification;energy usage measurements;secure end-to-end data aggregation;trapdoor chameleon hash function","","0","","21","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Furthermore, we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158635","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;DDoS;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers;hash;malicious;metric;queue;vulnerability","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","DDoS attacks;Distributed Denial of Service attacks;Internet;closed hash;computer-network designs;hash table data structure;malicious users;network mechanism vulnerability;open hash;queuing mechanisms;vulnerability metric","","2","","26","","2012-02-27","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Service-oriented vehicular networks are special categories for VANETs that support diverse infrastructure-based commercial infotainment services including, for instance, Internet access, real-time traffic monitoring and management, video streaming. Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.","2327-4662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940213","Intrusion detection;Service Attacks;Service-oriented vehicular;intrusion detection;networks;service attacks;service-oriented vehicular networks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Road traffic;Service-oriented architecture;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Wireless networks","computer network security;data communication;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","DoS;ELIDV;ITS;NS-3 simulator;VANET;denial of service;efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network;false alert generation;high-rate data communication;integrity target;intelligent transportation system;low false positive rate;malicious detection;road-side units;service-oriented vehicular network;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless network","","0","","23","","2014-10-30","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key section of code injection attack is a small piece of code, called shellcode, which performs unauthorized operations when it is injected into software as part of valid data. On Windows CE, input data are often encoded using Unicode before being processed. In such cases, shellcode should be built in a way that bypasses such encoding; that is, it should be Unicode-proof. Unicode-proof shellcode also has great advantage of evading instruction detection system. However, it is quite difficult to build Unicode-proof shellcode for the ARM architecture, on which most embedded devices are developed, because the subset of instructions that can be used to write Unicode-proof shellcode is very limited. Moreover, the instruction cache in the ARM processor restricts the application of self-modifying code, which is frequently used in shellcode writing. This novel research proposes an approach to building ARM Unicode-proof shellcode on Windows CE under these constraints. The approach applies to all versions of ARM processors and Windows CE, including systems evolved from Windows CE, such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. The shellcode is tested on three currently available devices.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6013556","Unicode-proof;Windows CE;code injection","Architecture;Buildings;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Registers;Security;Writing","invasive software;microprocessor chips;mobile handsets;operating systems (computers)","ARM architecture;ARM processor;Unicode-proof code injection attack;Unicode-proof shellcode;Windows CE;Windows Mobile;Windows Phone;embedded devices;instruction cache;instruction detection system;intrusion detection system;malware;mobile network;self-modifying code;shellcode writing;unauthorized operations","","1","","10","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CEP is capable of handling large variety of data with high computational velocity and delivers better solution compared to other existing techniques. However, handling large volume data streams still poses challenge in CEP systems. Hence, a middleware is required to manage huge streams of data on scalable distributed environment.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890520","Security requirements engineering;decision documentation;decision knowledge;heuristic analysis;knowledge carrying software;software evolution;user mon-itoring","Context;Documentation;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring;Security;Software","formal specification;security of data;system documentation","end user monitoring;heuristic analysis;heuristic assessment method;organization;security decision documentation;security decisions;security issues;security knowledge;semiautomatic security requirements engineering;software engineers;software evolution;vulnerability","","0","","18","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these schemes designed so far are not absolute and require more supporting systems. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is important to identify the malicious nodes, isolate the problem created by such nodes and notify the information of the malicious node to the other nodes. The ultimate aim of these schemes is to provide the necessary security cover to the network by adding encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation.

These SCADA systems utilize well-known behavior with limited variability. Trust of these control systems is vital to proper operation since improper operation could lead to catastrophic environmental disasters. Trust anchors can be used to provide this desired trust for the SCADA systems and these trust anchors can provide integrity for the required signals and assist in ensuring high availability of the SCADA system. However the implementation of a large number of trust anchors may not be possible due to the size of the deployed system and cost of a complete system replacement.

The detection mechanism put forward a state model which includes eight kinds of nodes by analyzing the input and output flow of the network nodes and the relationship between the input and output flow. Through the further analysis of the state model, we can distinguish the abnormal flow and the legitimate burst flow. The detection mechanism plays a timely role in early warning and prevention.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","0","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, with the significant development of network technologies, the current IDS architecture does not support high-speed communications. Therefore, improving the performance of IDS is a major concern for researchers. In this paper, we present a model of intrusion detection based on the classification of network connections. Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold. This threshold can be adjusted by the updating process of the classification model.","","978-1-4244-6726-6","","10.1109/ICIMP.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476902","classification;filtering;high-speed intrusion detection;learning","Degradation;Delay;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","pattern classification;security of data","IDS architecture;error threshold tolerance;high-speed networks;intelligent loss principle;intrusion detection systems;network connection classification","","1","","18","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy. The key to the accuracy of the Statistical IDS lies in the classification algorithm adopted and the training data set used.

In response, defenders have deployed cyber sensors in order to gain visibility into both network and host activities. However, the data generated by these sensors must be correlated to identify individual attacks. This is currently a highly manual process. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association. Our approach is to extend the multiple hypothesis tracking framework, from the standard kinematic domain, to the cyber domain. Combining the multiple hypothesis tracking framework with cyber association analytics will allow the formation of more accurate cyber attack tracks, reducing the computational burden currently residing on the human.","","978-1-4577-0267-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977647","Attack Correlation;Cyber Tracking;Multiple Hypothesis Tracking","Correlation;IP networks;Kinematics;Radar tracking;Sensors;Target tracking;Weight measurement","security of data;sensor fusion","cyber association analytics;cyber attack tracks;multiple hypothesis tracking","","1","","12","","","5-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","0","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.
