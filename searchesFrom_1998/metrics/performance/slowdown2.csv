A multiple regular expressions matching architecture for network intrusion detection system,Wei Zhang; Tian Song; Dongsheng Wang,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Tech., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing","Communications and Networking in China, 2008. ChinaCom 2008. Third International Conference on",20081121,2008,,,687,691,"Regular expressions are increasingly used in network security applications. Multiple regular expressions matching is one of the most important performance bottlenecks in those systems. This paper proposes a new hardware-based multiple regular-expressions matching architecture, called MRM, for network intrusion detection system. It shows that traditional algorithm, such as AC, has to face the serious spatial explosion problem when simultaneously detecting a large number of regular expressions because of constrained repetitions. MRM utilizes hardware RAM modules to share matching signals and exploits hardware register counting to implement constrained repetitions. This paper also proposes a software compiler to construct the hardware architecture and generate information in MRM's RAMs for the given regular expressions. Experiments in actual snort and bro regular expression sets show that MRM can achieve the high throughput of 2.1 Gbps and 2.8 Gbps on Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively.",,978-1-4244-2373-6,978-1-4244-2374-3,10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685118,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685118,intrusion detection;pattern matching;regular expression matching,Automata;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Face detection;Hardware;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads,packet radio networks;pattern matching;random-access storage;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security,RAM modules;bit rate 2.1 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.8 Gbit/s;multiple regular-expressions matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;regular expressions,,0,,11,,,25-27 Aug. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Fast and memory-efficient regular expression matching for deep packet inspection,"Fang Yu; Zhifeng Chen; Yanlei Diao; Lakshman, T.V.; Katz, R.H.","UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA","Architecture for Networking and Communications systems, 2006. ANCS 2006. ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20080725,2006,,,93,102,"Packet content scanning at high speed has become extremely important due to its applications in network security, network monitoring, HTTP load balancing, etc. In content scanning, the packet payload is compared against a set of patterns specified as regular expressions. In this paper, we first show that memory requirements using traditional methods are prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using real-world traffic and patterns show that our implementation achieves a factor of 12 to 42 performance improvement over a commonly used DFA- based scanner. Compared to the state-of-art NFA-based implementation, our DFA-based packet scanner achieves 50 to 700 times speedup.",,978-1-59593-580-9,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579527,DFA;deep packet;inspection;intrusion detection;regular expressions,Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Linux;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Payloads;Permission;Protocols,security of data,HTTP load balancing;deep packet inspection;memory requirements;network monitoring;network security;packet content scanning;packet payload;regular expression matching,,15,1,28,,,3-5 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Exhaust: Optimizing Wu-Manber pattern matching for intrusion detection using Bloom filters,"Aldwairi, M.; Al-Khamaiseh, K.","Coll. of Technol. Innovation, Zayed Univ., Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN), 2015 2nd World Symposium on",20150820,2015,,,1,6,"Intrusion detection systems are widely accepted as one of the main tools for monitoring and analyzing host and network traffic to protect data from illegal access or modification. Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.",,978-1-4799-8171-7,,10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081,Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber,Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads,data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data,Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems,,0,,19,,,21-23 March 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Optimization of excerpt query process for Packet Attribution System,"Renukuntla, S.S.B.; Rawat, S.","Int. Inst. of Inf. Technol., Hyderabad, India","Information Assurance and Security (IAS), 2014 10th International Conference on",20150323,2014,,,41,46,"Internet and its applications have increased to an enormous extent in the past decade. As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.",,978-1-4799-8098-7,,10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618,Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System,Hafnium;IP networks,Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing,AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback,,0,,18,,,28-30 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Exscind: Fast pattern matching for intrusion detection using exclusion and inclusion filters,"Aldwairi, M.; Alansari, D.","Dept. of Network Eng. & Security, Jordan Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Irbid, Jordan","Next Generation Web Services Practices (NWeSP), 2011 7th International Conference on",20111201,2011,,,24,30,"The need for efficient intrusion detection systems increases every day to protect network traffic against emerging attacks. Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.",,978-1-4577-1125-1,,10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148,Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching,Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors,pattern matching;security of data,Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching,,1,,28,,,19-21 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
