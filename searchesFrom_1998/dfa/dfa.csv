Deep packet inspection with DFA-trees and parametrized language overapproximation,"Luchaup, D.; De Carli, L.; Jha, S.; Bach, E.","U. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA","INFOCOM, 2014 Proceedings IEEE",20140708,2014,,,531,539,"IPSs determine whether incoming traffic matches a database of vulnerability signatures defined as regular expressions. DFA representations are popular, but suffer from the state-explosion problem. We introduce a new matching structure: a tree of DFAs where the DFA associated with a node over-approximates those at its children, and the DFAs at the leaves represent the signature set. Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate. Although built from approximate DFAs, DFA-trees perform exact matching faster than a commonly used method, have a low memory overhead and a guaranteed good worst case performance.",,,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847977,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847977,,Approximation error;Automata;Computers;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;Payloads;Training,computational complexity;deterministic automata;digital signatures;finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;tree data structures,CODFAs;DFA-trees;IPSs;NP-hard problem;benign traffic matching;compact overapproximate DFAs;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;intrusion prevention system;low false-match rate;low memory overhead;matching structure;parametrized language overapproximation;regular expressions;state-explosion problem;vulnerability signatures,,1,,30,,,April 27 2014-May 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Pattern-Based DFA for Memory-Efficient and Scalable Multiple Regular Expression Matching,Junchen Jiang; Yang Xu; Tian Pan; Yi Tang; Bin Liu,"Dept. of Comput.

However, combining many regex patterns into a single DFA causes a serious state explosion. Partitioning the pat-tern set into several subsets, each of which produces a small DFA, is a practical way to deflate the state explosion. In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA. Based on the privilege, we develop regex grouping algorithms for mitigating the state explosion in parallel and sequential matching environments, respectively. The evaluation shows that under the same constraints, our ap-proach requires only half the number of groups compared with the most well-known algorithms.",1550-3607,978-1-4244-6402-9,,10.1109/ICC.2010.5501973,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501973,,Automata;Communications Society;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Protocols,,,,4,,15,,,23-27 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata,"Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(||p<sup>2</sup>(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where  is the alphabet and c  1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-9919-9,,10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986,Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching,NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion,,11,,26,,,10-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

An IDS like the popular Snort [4] operates by scanning packet payload for known attack strings. It first builds a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a database of attack strings, and traverses this FSM using bytes from the packet payload.

A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security,Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue,"Tsinghua Univ., Beijing",INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE,20080502,2008,,,,,"Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters.

SRD-DFA: Achieving Sub-rule Distinguishing with Extended DFA Structure,Gao Xia; Xiaofei Wang; Bin Liu,"Dept. of Comput.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination.

Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks.

Reorganized and Compact DFA for Efficient Regular Expression Matching,Kai Wang; Yaxuan Qi; Yibo Xue; Jun Li,,"Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on",20110728,2011,,,1,5,"Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not.

Finite State Machine Parsing for Internet Protocols: Faster Than You Think,"Graham, R.D.; Johnson, P.C.",,"Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE",20141120,2014,,,185,190,"A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.",,,,10.1109/SPW.2014.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302,,Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches,Internet;finite state machines;protocols,FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications,,0,,9,,,17-18 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2012.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739,Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness,Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates,computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic,Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design,,1,,40,,5/29/2012,Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a content-less identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput.

In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.",,978-1-4799-5658-6,,10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322,Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine,Authentication;Databases,data mining;security of data,access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level,,0,,12,,,27-29 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
High-Performance and Compact Architecture for Regular Expression Matching on FPGA,"Yang, Y.-H.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr.

Each regular expression (regex) is first parsed into a concise token list representation, then compiled to a modular nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA) using a modified version of the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm. The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m  1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.",,978-0-7695-3102-1,,10.1109/ARES.2008.70,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529478,Software security;anomaly detection;discrete-event systems;finite-state automata,Automata;Discrete event systems;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Programming;Security;Software maintenance;Software testing,discrete event systems;finite state machines;security of data;software engineering,discrete-event systems;intrusion detection systems;legal usage representation;secure software development;software deterministic finite-state automaton,,0,,17,,,4-7 March 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Extraction of fingerprint from regular expression for efficient prefiltering,Xiaofei Wang; Junchen Jiang; Wei Lin; Yi Tang; Xiaojun Wang; Bin Liu,"Sch. of Electron.

IEEE International Conference on",20091208,2009,,,221,226,"Deep packet inspection at high speed has become extremely important due to its application in a wide range of network applications, such as network security and network monitoring. Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.",,978-1-4244-4816-6,978-1-4244-4817-3,10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207,bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme,Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads,computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching,Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats,,2,2,10,,,16-18 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778,Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion,Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management,finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data,Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton,,0,,25,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a Union then Minimize framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a Minimize then Union framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers.

In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs.

In order to reduce the number of state transitions, the finite state machine tiles in a string matcher adopt bit-level input symbols. Long target patterns are divided into subpatterns with a fixed length; deterministic finite automata are built with the subpatterns. Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710,Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching,Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security,buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching,AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection,,0,,12,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture.

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes.

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle.

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power.

We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area.

A popular automaton algorithm, Aho-Corasick (AC) is chosen to be implemented by adding the two techniques; we employ these two techniques in a memory efficient version of AC namely bitmap AC. For the average-case time, our approach improves bitmap AC by 494% and 224% speedup for URL and virus patterns, respectively. Since pre-hashing and root-indexing techniques can be concurrently executed with bitmap AC in the hardware, our proposed approach has the same worst-case time as bitmap AC.",2160-0511,0-7695-2407-9,,10.1109/ASAP.2005.8,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540374,,Automata;Coprocessors;Filtering algorithms;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching,automata theory;computer architecture;coprocessors;cryptography;file organisation;parallel algorithms;string matching,Aho-Corasick automaton;bitmap AC;content filtering coprocessor;hardware architecture;hashing function;parallel automaton string matching;prehashing;root-indexing,,3,,21,,,23-25 July 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Accelerating DFA Construction by Hierarchical Merging,Yanbing Liu; Li Guo; Muyi Guo; Ping Liu,,"Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (ISPA), 2011 IEEE 9th International Symposium on",20110714,2011,,,1,6,"Regular expression matching is widely used in many network applications to analyze suspicious traffic against predefined signatures, and to discover anomalous events. Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction. The basic idea of our method is to construct the combined DFA by hierarchical merging of the DFAs of each single regular expression. Our method runs in O(|Q||| In n) time, which is substantially superior to the time complexity O(|Q|||(<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>|Qi|)<sup>2</sup>) of classical subset construction algorithm.

Multi-byte Pattern Matching Using Stride-K DFA for High Speed Deep Packet Inspection,"Najam, M.; Younis, U.; Rasool, R.U.","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci. (SEECS), Nat. Univ. of Sci. & Technol.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.",,978-1-4799-7980-6,,10.1109/CSE.2014.125,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635,DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions,Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching,computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data,ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching,,0,,24,,,19-21 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Detecting Denial of Service Attacks using Cross Layer based Intrusion Detection System in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,"Bose, S.; Kannan, A.","Anna Univ., Chennai","Signal Processing, Communications and Networking, 2008. ICSCN '08. International Conference on",20080207,2008,,,182,188,"Ad hoc networks are a new paradigm of wireless communication for mobile hosts. Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions.

Agent based Intrusion Detection System: A Computational Biology Approach,S. Janakiraman; V. Vasudevan; S. Radhakrishnan,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., PSR Eng. Coll., Sivakasi","India Conference, 2006 Annual IEEE",20070212,2006,,,1,4,"This paper is focused on network and agent based intrusion detection systems. This paper includes an overview of several IDS implementations. Many approaches based on hidden Markov models and various forms of finite state automata have been proposed to solve problem of detecting anomaly intrusion, a security attack in which an intruder assumes the identity of a legitimate user. It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

The small process-footprint (multi or single threaded) makes this solution suitable for all platforms and operating systems. Thus, embedded systems as well as high performance PCs or workstations may run this service without operating expense. The proposed solution differs from other solutions by a simple installation process-since no interactions are existing between the host- and the NIDS-stack- and the ability to run applications on top of the IDS (e.g. alluring-systems or sandbox systems).

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,"Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; Salamatian, K.","Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2013 IEEE Symposium on",20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.",,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942,Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort,Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV,feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data,MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component,,0,,19,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Due to its large memory footprint, a large-dictionary AC-DFA can experience poor cache performance when matching against inputs with high match ratio on multicore processors. We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios.

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources.

Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). It is common knowledge in the research community that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. In this paper we discuss this accuracy problem and decompose it into a detection problem and a confirmation problem. We then map the evaluation of this accuracy problem to the traditional software verification and validation problem, which allows us to analyze the techniques academics have been using to evaluate their IDS technologies.

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.",,,,10.1109/SRDS.2014.28,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400,Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication,Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols,cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery,ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services,,0,,40,,,6-9 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.",,978-1-4799-7324-8,,10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470,Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort,Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software,computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips,CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing,,0,,33,,,4-8 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

However, existing parallel schemes often fail to achieve linear speedup in IDS. The throughput even deteriorates severely for some network traffics. Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF.

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.",,,,10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172,Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training,Cloud computing,cache storage;cloud computing;computer network security;finite state machines;pattern classification;protocols,DNS hijacking attacks;DNS protocol;DNS security;DNS traffic transition;DNS-IDS;IP addresses;anomaly metric;attack detection rate;bagging algorithm;cache poisoning attacks;classification algorithms;cloud computing;cloud era;cloud security;cloud services;finite state machine;intrusion detection system;normal temporal statistics;operational costs;operational phase;state machine;training phase,,,,,,,21-25 Sept. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second.

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the Search phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.",,978-0-7695-2858-9,,10.1109/ICNS.2007.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321,,Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system,,0,,15,,,19-25 June 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Unfortunately, it spends the majority of CPU time in packet classification to search for rules that match each packet. A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules.

Developing the proposal into a practical solution, an intrusion detection module is built and incorporated into the open source software GNU Gatekeeper (also named OpenH323GK).

SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc",,0-7803-9393-7,,10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605766,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605766,,Automatic control;Computer security;Control systems;Delay;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Runtime;Throughput,Internet;security of data;source coding;telecommunication security,accurate application-specific sandboxing policy;cybersecurity threats;hijacking attacks;production-mode network server;program semantics-aware intrusion detection system;source code;system call monitoring,,0,,24,,,17-20 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Fourth Annual International Conference on",20080212,2007,,,1,8,"The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks.

Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation.

Among the Web applications HTTP holds the majority share of the traffic transported through Web.

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the normal behavior DNA sequence through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed.

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

The proposed method uses two-stage matching: In the first stage, a hardware filter quickly scans the text to find partial matches, and in the second stage, the MPU scans the text to find a total match in the ClamAV 514,287 virus pattern set. To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method.

In our scenario, agents perform possibly different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Indeed, agents plan their next actions by following a set of logic rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. However, some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to spontaneous failure or tampering. To detect such misbehaviors, we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor that uses only locally available information.

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule.

A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis.

Hardware acceleration of regular expression repetitions in deep packet inspection,"Cronin, B.; Xiaojun Wang","Sch. of Electron. Eng., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland","Information Security, IET",20131219,2013,7,4,327,335,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) make extensive use of regular expressions (regexes) as attack signatures. Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary.

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.",,1-4244-0910-1,1-4244-0910-1,10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344,,Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems,Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data,DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching,,2,,18,,,26-30 March 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point.

In this paper, we propose a distributed intrusion detection approach based on finish state machine (FSM).A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data.

In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.",1081-6011,0-7695-2339-0,,10.1109/SP.2005.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056,,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring,automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data,IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm,,7,1,19,,,8-11 May 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS.

Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.",,978-1-4244-1513-7,978-1-4244-1513-7,10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922,Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber,Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design,,,,2,,14,,,29-31 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection,"Al-Subaie, M.; Zulkernine, M.","Queen's Univ., Kingston","Communications, 2007. ICC '07.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS.

Parsing application layer protocol with commodity hardware for SDN,Hao Li; Chengchen Hu; Junkai Hong; Xiyu Chen; Yuming Jiang,"Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2015 ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20150521,2015,,,51,61,"The de facto implementation of Software Defined Networking (SDN), i.e., OpenFlow, only parses L2-L4 headers, which limits the use of SDN to employ control intelligence in application layer. In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA).

In this paper, we present a survey of the main types of attack at the network layer, and we then review intrusion detection and protection mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. We classify these mechanisms as either point detection algorithms that deal with a single type of attack, or as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that can deal with a range of attacks.

A large portion of scanning activity is of a slow scan type and is not currently detectable by security appliances. In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time. This technique provides insight into Internet traffic by classifying known activities, giving visibility to threats to the network through scan detection, while also extending awareness of the activities occurring on the network.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2011.2109009,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720528,Security and protection;system management;traffic analysis,Backscatter;Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Probes;Protocols;Sockets,IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication security,IP address;Internet traffic;activity information;malicious activity detection;network activity classification schema;packet-level data;periodicity;scan detection;scan probes;scanning activity;time 24 h,,9,,35,,2/28/2011,Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

An 86% Efficiency 12 W Self-Sustaining PV Energy Harvesting System With Hysteresis Regulation and Time-Domain MPPT for IOT Smart Nodes,"Xiaosen Liu; Sanchez-Sinencio, E.","Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX, USA","Solid-State Circuits, IEEE Journal of",20150522,2015,50,6,1424,1437,"This paper presents a fully-integrated W-level photovoltaic (PV) self-sustaining energy harvesting system proposed for smart nodes of Internet of Things (IOT) networks. A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations.

Probabilistic model checking for AMI intrusion detection,"Ali, M.Q.; Al-Shaer, E.","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning.

The method is based on a goal-oriented framework for generating and resolving obstacles to goal satisfaction. The extended framework addresses malicious obstacles (called anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through anti-goal refinement until leaf nodes are derived that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as countermeasures by application of threat resolution operators to the specification of the anti-requirements and vulnerabilities revealed by the analysis.

The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided.

Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits.

How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads.

Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing,"Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20110728,2011,37,4,575,591,"A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations. This protocol-handling layer is made up of a set of data structures that represent a message, a parser that fills in these data structures, and various stub functions to access these data structures or drive the parsing of a message.",0098-5589,,,10.1109/TSE.2010.64,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487528,Network protocols;domain-specific languages.;message composing;message parsing,Access protocols;Computer bugs;Data structures;Domain specific languages;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Robustness;Streaming media;Web server,Internet;computational linguistics;formal specification;program compilers;protocols;specification languages;telecommunication computing,ABNF;Internet era;Zebu compiler;Zebu syntax;data structures;domain-specific languages;language-based approach;message parsing;network protocol message processing;protocol specification;protocol-handling layer;textual HTTP-like application protocols,,5,,34,,6/17/2010,July-Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.",1545-5971,,,10.1109/TDSC.2008.1,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182,Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity,,Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data,Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability,,12,,27,,2/2/2008,Jan.-March 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

An Approach to Generate Safety Validation Test Cases from UML Activity Diagram,"Tiwari, S.; Gupta, A.","Indian Inst. of Inf. Technol.

Occurrence of such failures may be hazardous for the regular functioning of the software. Majority of these failures occur because of the unforeseen faults that manifest themselves during the execution of the software. The contemporary trends in the software industry indicate dedicated efforts to minimize these unforeseen faults, thereby minimizing the chances of unforeseen failures. One of the definitive ways is to analyze the specifications thoroughly for the potential faults it may contain. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one such approach that scans the specifications to identify potential failure modes and has been used successfully in many domains including software. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate test cases from UML activity diagram specifications by first transforming an activity diagram into a Software Success Tree (SST) and a Software Fault Tree (SFT). Subsequently, the SST and the SFT are then used to generate test cases for testing the normal and exceptional behavior of the system, respectively. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using an illustrative example and compare its effectiveness with the other activity diagram based test case generation techniques.",1530-1362,978-1-4799-2143-0,,10.1109/APSEC.2013.35,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805406,UML;activity diagram;fault;model based testing;software fault tree;test cases,Analytical models;Fault trees;Logic gates;Software;Software algorithms;Testing;Unified modeling language,Unified Modeling Language;fault trees;formal specification;program testing;software fault tolerance,FTA;SFT;SST;UML activity diagram specification;fault tree analysis;safety validation test;software fault tree;software success tree;test case generation technique,,0,,28,,,2-5 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository.

However, in the presence of attackers, reliable and trustworthy operations in such networks become impossible without securing routing protocols. In this paper, we target to study and design a secure routing protocol S-GyTAR for vehicular environments. Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set.

A property oriented fault detection approach for link state routing protocol,"Feiyi Wang; Fengmin Gong; Wu, F.S.","MCNC, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA","Computer Communications and Networks, 2000. Proceedings. Ninth International Conference on",20020806,2000,,,114,119,"This paper proposes a new approach to fault detection for a link state routing system-property oriented analysis and detection (POD). A routing system is modeled as a set of distributed processes. A property is defined as state predicate(s) over system variables. For the link state routing protocol, the high-level overall converging property P is defined as the synchronization among routing information bases maintained by all processes. We decompose the routing protocol into different computation phases. For each phase, we use invariant state predicates (safety property) and the liveness property as our guide for observation and analysis. The goal of the detection algorithm is to construct a validation path based on the history to determine if the fault is natural or malicious once the stable property P is rendered invalid by faults. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, a new detection approach is proposed that differs from traditional signature-based or profile-based intrusion detection paradigms in the sense that it utilizes the stable property as a starting point, and correlates the history and future to validate changes in the system; second, by exploring the primary concerned system properties, we show that detection effort can be conducted in a more focused and systematic fashion",1095-2055,0-7803-6494-5,,10.1109/ICCCN.2000.885479,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885479,,ARPANET;Computer science;Costs;Detection algorithms;Fault detection;History;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Safety;Topology,authorisation;computer network management;computer network reliability;protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing,distributed processes;fault detection;intrusion detection;invariant state predicates;link state routing protocol;liveness property;malicious fault;natural fault;property oriented analysis;safety property;synchronization;system variables;validation path,,1,,17,,,2000,16 Oct 2000-18 Oct 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters.

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.",,978-1-59593-082-8,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260,data-caches;multithreading;network processors,Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput,internetworking;multi-threading,asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses,,6,3,42,,,26-28 Oct. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces.

First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption.

In behavior-based approaches to anomaly detection, the model of normal behavior is constructed from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns. Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure.

Fifth Annual IEEE International Conference on",20070402,2007,,,477,482,"Mission-critical telecom servers are being ported from their safe PSTN haven to the Internet to cator to the VoIP user base increasing failures due to greater susceptibility to attacks. Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's many worlds theory that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services",,0-7695-2788-4,,10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882,,Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server,Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines,Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security,,0,1,10,,,19-23 March 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Routeguard: an intrusion detection and response system for mobile ad hoc networks,"Hasswa, A.; Zulkernine, M.; Hassanein, H.","Sch. of Comput., Queen''s Univ., Kingston, Ont., Canada","Wireless And Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications, 2005.

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.",,0-7803-9181-0,,10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922,,Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security,Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system,,2,,20,,,22-24 Aug. 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

e-NeXSh: achieving an effectively non-executable stack and heap via system-call policing,"Kc, G.S.; Keromytis, A.D.","Google Inc., Mountain View, CA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 21st Annual",20060103,2005,,,15 pp.,302,"We present e-NeXSh, a novel security approach that utilises kernel and LIBC support for efficiently defending systems against process-subversion attacks. Such attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software to override its program control-flow and consequently invoke system calls, causing out-of-process damage. Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process. We implemented e-NeXSh as a set of modifications to the Linux-2.4.18-3 kernel and a new user-space shared library (e-NeXSh.so). The technique is transparent, requiring no modifications to existing libraries or applications. e-NeXSh was able to successfully defeat both code-injection and LIBC-based attacks in our effectiveness tests.

This occurs because the contemporary migration implementation only takes VM encapsulated states into account, but ignores VM related security context(SC) needed by NSE-H embedded security engines (SE). We presented a comprehensive live migration framework for the NSE-H, considering both the execution context encapsulated in VM instance and the VM related security context within the SEs. We built a prototype system of the framework based on stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network.

ProWord: An unsupervised approach to protocol feature word extraction,"Zhuo Zhang; Zhibin Zhang; Lee, P.P.C.; Yunjie Liu; Gaogang Xie","Inst. of Comput.

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches.

MobiQuitous '09. 6th Annual International",20091110,2009,,,1,10,"The increasingly deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) challenge traditional network management systems because of the shared open medium and the varying channel conditions. There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.",,978-963-9799-59-2,,10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395,,Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol,fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN,IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications,,3,,34,,,13-16 July 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper proposes a fully integrated harvesting system in 0.18-m CMOS technology. Utilizing a small commercial solar cell of 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, the proposed system can provide 0-29 W of power, which is much higher than the commonly used passive radio-frequency identification devices in IOT application. The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme.

Hence, it becomes essential to design algorithms that can work efficiently on such huge amounts of data. The pattern matching problem basically consists of finding all occurrences of a pattern in the given text, over some alphabet.

QoS and security in energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks,"Taddeo, A.V.; Mura, Marcello; Ferrante, Alberto","ALaRI, Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, via G. Buffi 13, Lugano, Switzerland","Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT), Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on",20110405,2010,,,1,10,"Wireless sensor networks are composed of small nodes that might be used for a variety of purposes. Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696,Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority,Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks,,,,0,,22,,,26-28 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Accelerating Multi-Patterns Matching on Compressed HTTP Traffic,"Bremler-Barr, A.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE",20090602,2009,,,397,405,"One of the fundamental technique which is used today by network security tools to detect malicious activities is 'signature based' detection. Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic.

Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey.

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits.

This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate potential associates for collaborative interaction. A distributed, node-centric approach to trust management processes behavior grades into a reputation that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The application of a reputation against a dynamic risk assessment gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance and current the network environment.

Due to the open environment of packet switched network, the signaling protocols (such as SIP and H.323) and the transport protocols (e.g. RTP and SRTP) used by VoIP, it is prone to unwanted accesses and does not comply with the security standards. VoIP is also vulnerable to threats from TCP/IP and UDP. Furthermore, the malicious users can exhaust proxy and end users with INIVTE flooding in SIP.

While most fences meet these requirements by building a physical and psychological barrier against intruders, this is not sufficient for areas of particular interest like restricted areas of an airport or construction sites with expensive goods. To detect intruders we integrate wireless sensor nodes into a fence. We fulfill the requirements for real-world energy-awareness by using active sensors with configurable logic, power saving modes like WOR and power down modes.

A Scalable High-Performance Virus Detection Processor Against a Large Pattern Set for Embedded Network Security,Chieh-Jen Cheng; Chao-Ching Wang; Wei-Chun Ku; Tien-Fu Chen; Jinn-Shyan Wang,"Dept. of Comput.

Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.",1063-8210,,,10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396,Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection,Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip,authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching,antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor,,0,,25,,3/28/2011,May-12,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Improving network management with software defined networking,"Hyojoon Kim; Feamster, N.",,"Communications Magazine, IEEE",20130214,2013,51,2,114,119,"Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.",0163-6804,,,10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461195,,Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Control systems;Home automation;Logic gates;Software radio;Telecommunication network management,computer network management;high level languages;telecommunication security,SDN;complex high-level network policy;high-level policy language;logically centralized software program;low-level vendor-specific configuration;network management;packet forwarding device;secure communication;software defined networking;stop-gap solution,,71,1,,,,Feb-13,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically. This ability to handle variable execution times is especially useful as DSP applications and platforms increase in complexity and adaptive behavior, thereby reducing execution time predictability.",2160-0511,978-1-4673-2243-0,978-0-7695-4768-8,10.1109/ASAP.2012.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341457,Data?ow Graphs;Digital Signal Processing;Multiprocessor Dynamic Scheduling,Digital signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Multicore processing;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules,protocols;radio networks;signal processing,DSP applications;DSP components;PEG;digital signal processing;dynamic adaptation;dynamic scheduling opportunities;dynamic scheduling techniques;exposing parallelism;online reconfiguration;partial expansion graphs;real time operating systems;wireless communications protocols,,1,,16,,,9-11 July 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

ISECS '09. Second International Symposium on",20091023,2009,2,,34,38,"High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. In TCP, a communication data stream is split into packets. Therefore, a target pattern may span multiple packets. Such fragmented pattern cannot be discovered by a per-packet scan. This is a serious problem in applications such as NIDS that require a complete scan. To avoid the problem, it is necessary to scan TCP streams. Stream-level parallelism is not a substantial solution because bandwidth depends on the number of active TCP streams. To scan each stream separately using one matching unit, the match states must be swapped appropriately. Another problem is, as parts of network infrastructure, the inspection units should support the function of QoS. In this paper, we proposed a multi-pattern matching automaton DSC-AC for high speed multi-stream packet scanning. We given out the construction of DSC-AC and optimized it with optimal and two binary searching tree and bit-map AC.

A lightweight countermeasure to cope with flooding attacks against session initiation protocol,"Hussain, I.; Djahel, S.; Geneiatakis, D.; Nait-Abdesselam, F.","LIPADE, Univ. of Paris Descartes, Paris, France","Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC), 2013 6th Joint IFIP",20130627,2013,,,1,5,"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a widely used protocol for voice and video communication in Internet architecture. Due to its open nature and the lack of robust security mechanisms, SIP is vulnerable to several attacks similar to those existing in Internet infrastructure, such as the flooding attack. An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user.

Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one.

Provable Protection against Web Application Vulnerabilities Related to Session Data Dependencies,"Desmet, L.; Verbaeten, P.; Joosen, W.; Piessens, F.","Katholieke Univ. Leuven, Leuven","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",20080131,2008,34,1,50,64,"Web applications are widely adopted and their correct functioning is mission critical for many businesses. At the same time, Web applications tend to be error prone and implementation vulnerabilities are readily and commonly exploited by attackers. The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application.

In particular, many anomaly detection systems employ CFGs. Unfortunately, typical CFG-based systems rely on inaccurate or impractical heuristics. For example, the state space may be restricted by considering only a call graph, thus reducing accuracy and precision. In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters,"Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on",20090127,2008,,,73,80,"PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.",,978-1-4244-3783-2,978-1-4244-2796-3,10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368,,Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic,computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases,Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler,,2,,22,,,8-10 Dec. 2008,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

In order to accomplish that, it is assumed that most of the network attacks change the structure of the traffic. This enforces anomaly and hence subsequent intrusion can be detected if the structure or signature of the traffic flow is investigated.

This problem arises in various fields, such as computational biology and network security. But the problem is not extensively studied as the single pattern case and there is no efficient algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub></sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> Ig |p<sub>i</sub>| bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log  + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text.

Memory Protection through Dynamic Access Control,"Zhang, K.; Tao Zhang; Santosh Pande","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA","Microarchitecture, 2006. MICRO-39. 39th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on",20061226,2006,,,123,134,"Current anomaly detection schemes focus on control flow monitoring. Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead",1072-4451,0-7695-2732-9,,10.1109/MICRO.2006.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841,,Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime,authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring,anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics,,2,,27,,,9-13 Dec. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests.

In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module.

A novel decentralized and scalable architecture that can be adopted to realize a monitor of the agents' behavior is proposed. We consider agents which may perform different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Agents plan their next actions by following a set of rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they dictate actions that depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. Some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to tampering or spontaneous failure. To detect such misbehaviors we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor using only locally available information.

Speeding up pattern matching by optimal partial string extraction,Tan Jianlong; Liu Xia; Liu Yanbing; Liu Ping,"Inst. of Comput.

Suffix matching algorithms have good time efficiency, and thus are widely used. These algorithms require that all patterns in a set have the same length. When the patterns cannot satisfy this requirement, the leftmost characters, m being the length of the shortest pattern, are extracted to construct the data structure. We call such m-character strings partial strings. However, a simple extraction from the left does not address the impact of partial string locations on search speed. We propose a novel method to extract the partial strings from each pattern which maximizes search speed. More specifically, with this method we can compute all the corresponding searching time cost by theoretical derivation, and choose the location which yields an approximately minimal search time.

Securing the Internet routing infrastructure,"Papadimitratos, P.; Haas, Z.J.","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY, USA","Communications Magazine, IEEE",20021210,2002,40,10,60,68,"The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

Exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities (SQLIV) through successful attacks might result in severe consequences such as authentication bypassing, leaking of private information etc. Therefore, testing an application for SQLIV is an important step for ensuring its quality. However, it is challenging as the sources of SQLIV vary widely, which include the lack of effective input filters in applications, insecure coding by programmers, inappropriate usage of APIs for manipulating databases etc. Moreover, existing testing approaches do not address the issue of generating adequate test data sets that can detect SQLIV. In this work, we present a mutation-based testing approach for SQLIV testing. We propose nine mutation operators that inject SQLIV in application source code. The operators result in mutants, which can be killed only with test data containing SQL injection attacks. By this approach, we force the generation of an adequate test data set containing effective test cases capable of revealing SQLIV. We implement a MUtation-based SQL Injection vulnerabilities Checking (testing) tool (MUSIC) that automatically generates mutants for the applications written in Java Server Pages (JSP) and performs mutation analysis. We validate the proposed operators with five open source web-based applications written in JSP.

Traffic flow management in next generation service provider networks  Are we there yet?,"Goss, R.; Botha, R.","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Information Security South Africa (ISSA), 2011",20110926,2011,,,1,6,"For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as safe or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic in the dark.",,978-1-4577-1481-8,,10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529,Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN,Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols,IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic,IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management,,0,,19,,,15-17 Aug. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Control theoretic approach to intrusion detection using a distributed hidden Markov model,"Khanna, R.; Huaping Liu","INTEL Corp., Santa Clara, CA","Wireless Communications, IEEE",20080815,2008,15,4,24,33,"Cooperative ad hoc wireless networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks than traditional wired networks. Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine.

SIMD parallelization of applications that traverse irregular data structures,"Ren, B.; Agrawal, G.; Larus, J.R.; Mytkowicz, T.; Poutanen, T.; Schulte, W.","Dept. of Comput.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.",,978-1-4673-5524-7,,10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989,Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD,Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation,data structures;optimisation;parallel programming,SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach,,1,,37,,,23-27 Feb. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A common solution is to close the performance gap through hardware implementation of security functions. However, continuously expanding signature databases have become a major impediment to achieving scalable hardware based pattern matching. Additionally, evolutionary rule databases have necessitated real time online updating for reconfigurable hardware implementations. Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified. The approach is verified with patterns from the latest version of the Snort rule database.

Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP,"Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory.
