Multiple regular expressions matching is one of the most important performance bottlenecks in those systems. This paper proposes a new hardware-based multiple regular-expressions matching architecture, called MRM, for network intrusion detection system. It shows that traditional algorithm, such as AC, has to face the serious spatial explosion problem when simultaneously detecting a large number of regular expressions because of constrained repetitions. MRM utilizes hardware RAM modules to share matching signals and exploits hardware register counting to implement constrained repetitions. This paper also proposes a software compiler to construct the hardware architecture and generate information in MRM's RAMs for the given regular expressions. Experiments in actual snort and bro regular expression sets show that MRM can achieve the high throughput of 2.1 Gbps and 2.8 Gbps on Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively.","","978-1-4244-2373-6;9781424423736","978-1-4244-2374-3;9781424423743","10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685118","intrusion detection;pattern matching;regular expression matching","Automata;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Face detection;Hardware;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","packet radio networks;pattern matching;random-access storage;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security","RAM modules;bit rate 2.1 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.8 Gbit/s;multiple regular-expressions matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;regular expressions","","0","","11","","","25-27 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a form of computer network packet filtering that examines not only the header portion but also the payload part of a packet as it passes through an inspection point, searching for protocol noncompliance, viruses, Spam, intrusions or some predefined criteria to decide if the packet can pass it or it needs to be routed to a different destination. Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching. DFA representations of a regular expression sets in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application. This paper presents an analysis of different compact representation of DFA such as D<sup>2</sup>FA, δFA, δ<sup>2</sup>FA.","","978-1-4673-3149-4;9781467331494","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394708","DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Pattern matching","computer network security;computer viruses;finite automata;protocols;string matching;unsolicited e-mail","δ<sup>2</sup>FA;D<sup>2</sup>FA;DFA-based pattern matching;DPI;computer network packet filtering;deep packet inspection;delta finite automata;inspection point;intrusions;network security applications;protocol noncompliance searching;regular expression-based pattern matching;spam;string matching algorithms;virus","","1","","17","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
