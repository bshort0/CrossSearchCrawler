Since drugs are manufactured in facilities controlled by DMCS in these days, DMCS's functions and performance must be adequate and safe. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is used to investigate the safety. To conduct FMEA effectively, it is important to enumerate all failure modes. But it is difficult because of the differences of ability of each engineer. To solve this problem, we grouped failure modes in existing FMEA results by type. And we develop a list that consists of common failure modes, failures and countermeasures.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game. We conduct our model on the famous data set in security area and obtained result is promising.","","978-1-4673-6489-8;9781467364898","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620042","Nash Equilibrium;attacker cost;intrusion detection system;sensor cost","Ad hoc networks;Educational institutions;Games;Intrusion detection;Nash equilibrium;Sensitivity","computer network security;game theory","IDS behavior;IDS sensitivity control;IDS sensitivity degree;IDS sensitivity reduction;Internet;attacker behavior;attacker modelling;computer networks;game theoretic approach;information security paradigm enhancement;intrusion detection system;received packet analysis;received packet monitoring;security tool;social lives;system administrator;system costs;system modelling;two-player-noncooperative game","","0","","12","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","1","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8;0769521088","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However little has been done to use a control-theoretic approach for SDN and NFV management. In this paper, we describe a use case for NFV management using control theory and SDN. We use the management architecture of RINA (a clean-slate Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) to manage Virtual Network Function (VNF) instances over the GENI testbed. We deploy Snort, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as the VNF. Our network topology has source and destination hosts, multiple IDSes, an Open vSwitch (OVS) and an OpenFlow controller. A distributed management application running on RINA measures the state of the VNF instances and communicates this information to a Proportional Integral (PI) controller, which then provides load balancing information to the OpenFlow controller. The latter controller in turn updates traffic flow forwarding rules on the OVS switch, thus balancing load across the VNF instances. This paper demonstrates the benefits of using such a control-theoretic load balancing approach and the RINA management architecture in virtualized environments for NFV management. It also illustrates that GENI can easily support a wide range of SDN and NFV related experiments.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502972","","Conferences;Control theory;Load management;Monitoring;Switches","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication control;virtualisation","NFV management;OpenFlow controller;SDN;clean slate recursive internetwork architecture;control theory;load balancing;management architecture;network function virtualization;network topology;software defined networking;virtual network function management","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML.

To solve this problem, we focused on anomaly-detection methods. Although these methods have been proposed for computer systems, few studies have focused on IP networks. Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations. Evaluation results show that the anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector is effective in detecting network faults in IP networks, but it has two problems. One is that this method may detect normal states as anomalies and the other is that optimizing the discounting factor for detecting sequential faults is difficult.","","978-1-4577-1668-3;9781457716683","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077024","Fault Detection;IP Network;Matrix Eigenvector;Multi-Variant Analysis","Bandwidth;Data models;Fault detection;IP networks;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Vectors","IP networks;computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;computer network security;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;fault location;matrix algebra","IP network reliability;anomaly detection method;matrix eigenvector;network fault detection method;network fault simulation;network monitoring alarms","","2","","6","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To fulfill these requirements, there is a need to shift from traditional computing practices to new computing practices that give access to a broader network, unlimited resources, and enables self-service on demand at a reasonable cost using pay per use method. All these requirements can be fulfilled with cloud computing. Cloud Computing has a number of advantages as well as disadvantages. Security is a major threat to the cloud computing because the data placed on cloud servers is always vulnerable as there are lots of attackers on the internet who tries to compromise the security of the cloud. To overcome this issue, we use security appliances in the form of physical machines or by virtualization. A significant amount of power is consumed by security appliances which not only leads to the high energy costs but also a major threat to the environment as carbon-dioxide is released. So there is a need to find optimal solutions for providing security in cloud computing environment in an efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on existing cloud security frameworks has been done. Based upon the limitations on existing frameworks a new framework has been proposed to provide security in virtual networks that is based on Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) and its prototype implementation has also been done.","","","","10.1109/CCCS.2015.7374153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7374153","IDPS;green cloud computing;security","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data privacy;Green products;Security;Servers;Virtualization","cloud computing;green computing;security of data;virtualisation","IDPS;cloud security frameworks;green cloud computing security;intrusion detection and prevention system;virtual networks","","","","21","","","4-5 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Munchen, Munich, Germany","IFIP Networking Conference, 2013","20131114","2013","","","1","9","Many current traffic monitoring systems employ deep packet inspection (DPI) in order to analyze network traffic. These systems include intrusion detection systems, software for network traffic accounting, traffic classification, or systems for monitoring service-level agreements. Traffic volumes and link speeds of current enterprise and ISP networks transform the process of inspecting traffic payload into a challenging task. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive sampling algorithm that selects the maximum number of packets from the network that the DPI system is able to consume. Our algorithm adapts its sampling rate according to the network traffic currently observed, and the number of packets that a monitoring application is able to process. It can be used in conjunction with current multicore-aware network traffic analysis setups, which allow for exploiting current multi-core hardware. We show the applicability of our algorithm with live-tests on a heavily used 10G link with real network monitoring tools.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663536","","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Instruction sets;Monitoring;Packet loss;Payloads","Internet;inspection;performance evaluation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","DPI;ISP networks;adaptive load-aware sampling;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;intrusion detection systems;multicore commodity hardware;multicore-aware network traffic analysis;network monitoring tools;network traffic accounting;service level agreements;traffic classification;traffic monitoring systems;traffic payload","","1","","32","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","1","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET).

The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);Tutorials;application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","6","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue.

Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized. Performance evaluation results from the experimental test bed shows that the fine grained model detects signaling attacks with high classification accuracy.","2159-3442;21593442","978-1-4799-8639-2;9781479986392","","10.1109/TENCON.2015.7372954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372954","SIP;VoIP;entropy;machine learning;signaling attack;traffic classification","Entropy;Feature extraction;Floods;Real-time systems;Servers;Support vector machines;Training","Internet telephony;internetworking;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;quality of service;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication congestion control","Internet traffic;QoS;SIP signaling attack detection;VoIP class;entropy model;flooding attack;gateway;high classification accuracy;interconnection;learning phase;minimal feature set;multiclass SVM;nonVoIP class;nonflooding attack;performance evaluation;quality of service;server congestion;session initiation protocol;signaling protocol;support vector machine;two-tier fine grained model;voice over Internet protocol","","","","18","","","1-4 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they have the shortcoming that there are undetectable intrusions according to types for each measure and modeling method because each intrusion type results in anomalies. We propose a multiple-measure intrusion detection method to remedy this drawback of conventional anomaly detectors. We measure normal behavior by system calls, resource usage and file access events and build up profiles for normal behavior with a hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method, which are integrated with a rule-based approach.

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics.

Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.","1098-7584;10987584","978-1-4244-7315-1;9781424473151","978-1-4244-7316-8;9781424473168","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007564","artificial immune systems;dendritic cell algorithm;intrusion detection;multiagent","Adaptive systems;Computers;Context;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection","artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;security of data","activation threshold;adaptive immune subsystem;agent-based artificial immune systems;artificial T-cell agents;computer host;danger theory;danger value calculation;dendritic cell functionality;dentritic cells agents;human immune system;innate immune subsystem;intrusion detection systems;malicious behaviors;malicious intrusions;mature context antigen value calculation;multiagent-based IDS;security operating center","","1","","14","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using a proxy to handle service calls and relying on service replication strategies, we effectively deal with the complexity and overhead issues.

To ensure the security and reliability of a modernized power grid, the current deployment of millions of smart meters requires the development of innovative situational awareness solutions to prevent compromised devices from impacting the stability of the grid and the reliability of the energy distribution infrastructure. To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","978-1-4577-2005-5;9781457720055","978-0-7695-4590-5;9780769545905","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","39","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed approach uses multiple network connections between a pair of communicating hosts to transmit covert data. Hence this covert channel is unaffected by underlying unpredictable network conditions. The concealed data is embedded in the order and sequence of connections to/from which regular (cover) packets of data are sent/received.

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead. We demonstrate its generality by inspecting four aspects information about the target virtual machines with different guest OSes.

We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system.

Then, we can determine whether we need to perform network or security operation. We apply clustering algorithm for AID and classification algorithm for MID. The nonlinear adaptive system is trained for running MID and AID in parallel. Proposed parallel system is more lightweight and simple to operate even if the number of incident patterns is increased. Experimental results in the case where false positive is frequently caused show that our method is functional with a recognition rate of attacks less than 10%, while finding the anomaly status.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks.

So far the focus of most studies of this problem has been on either blocking unused ports (fire-walling) or detecting attacks with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper we introduce the design and implementation of SecureDirect, which is an attempt at addressing the problem of intrusion prevention by combining an IDS with a stateful load balancer SecureDirect is a real time load balancer that distinguishes between traffic coming from ""good"" clients and traffic originating from attackers. Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated. The advantage of this system is that it blocks intrusions in a manner transparent to the attacker and allows for observation and investigation of attacks in order to enable the administrator to take appropriate action. We also suggest possible uses for this type of system, and then present the results of a series of stress tests against our implementation of the idea.","","0-7695-1906-7;0769519067","","10.1109/AINA.2003.1192971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192971","","Delay;Humans;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Stress;System testing;Traffic control;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;authorisation;client-server systems;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;SecureDirect;attackers;clients;content based traffic control;intrusion prevention;proactive security;public servers;real time load balancer;stateful load balancer;unauthorized accesses","","0","","11","","","27-29 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a behavior analysis-based learning framework for host level network intrusion detection is proposed, consisting of two parts, anomaly detection and alert verification. The anomaly detection module processes unlabeled data using a clustering algorithm to detect abnormal behaviors. The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms. In this framework, the host behavior is not represented by a single user or program activity; instead, it is represented by a set of factors, called behavior set, so that the host behavior can be described more accurately and completely","","0-7695-2772-8;0769527728","","10.1109/ECBS.2007.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4148961","","Change detection algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Face detection;Humans;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","alert verification;anomaly detection;behavior analysis-based learning;clustering algorithm;intrusion detection;machine learning;rule learning based mechanism","","2","","16","","","26-29 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated. Experiments show that the proposed software architecture reduces 30% of CPU utilization.

However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6;9781424476756","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These monitoring tools assist system administrators in assessing and improving the health of their infrastructure. A successful attack on the infrastructure monitoring tools grants the attacker elevated power over the monitoring tasks, and eventually over some management functionality of the interface or over hosts running those interfaces. Additionally, detailed and accurate fingerprinting and reconnaissance of a target infrastructure is possible when such interfaces are publicly exposed. A successful reconnaissance allows an attacker to craft an efficient secondstage attacks, such as targeted, mimicry and blended attacks. We provide in this paper a comprehensive security analysis of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools for grids, clusters and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. We also provide insights based on the infrastructure data openly exposed over the Internet. The wide use of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools makes this data exposure possible. For example, we found such monitoring interfaces to expose infrastructure details of systems inside many high-profile organizations, including two top national laboratories for nuclear research and one top Internet non-profit foundation. We also present our findings on a plethora of web vulnerabilities in the entire version-span of such monitoring tools, and discuss at a high-level the possible attacks. The results of our research allow us to “monitor” an “alarming” mismanagement reality of grid infrastructure.

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0;0769525490","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","4","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole. We will also propose our novel monitoring framework, which is designed to overcome the challenges of monitoring in a SoS environment. This paper also details our implementation and presents some of our initial results.","2151-4763;21514763","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766347","misbehaviour;monitoring;system-of-systems","Aerodynamics;Collaboration;Measurement;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Real-time systems;Security","security of data;system monitoring;systems engineering","SoS environment;collaborative environment;component misbehaviour monitoring;component system behaviour unpredictability;dynamic component system behaviour;environment heterogeneity;security threats;system-of-system components","","0","","23","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper tries to exploit some interesting concepts proposed by the new danger theory to overcome the problems associated with the self and non-self model. That by improving NSA in order to achieve better detection rates by integrating the basic danger concepts. In this approach, the intrusion detection is related to the damage that can occur in the system and that can be caused by both external elements such as internal elements. The proposed algorithm integrates and combines the basic concepts of intrusion detection systems IDS based on the role of T cells described by the negative selection algorithm, with those inspired by the role of dendritic cells to process the alarm signals and to judge thereafter whether there is presence of a dangerous element or not.","2327-6525;23276525","978-1-4799-6608-0;9781479966080","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990233","Ad hoc networks;Artificial Immune Systems;Danger theory;Intrusion detection;Negative selection;Security","Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Sociology;Statistics","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET security;NSA;artificial immune systems;danger theory concepts;dendritic cells;intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm","","1","","12","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services.

The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed.

This paper is a brief review on such attacks whose focus is on degrading MANETs efficiency. It extends in apprising well identified intrusion detection and detection techniques for wide range of attacks.

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.","1091-0050;10910050","978-1-4799-0052-7;9781479900527","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421","","Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security","","1","","20","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several experiments were run to evaluate the effects of open source intrusion detection and prevention systems Snort and Suricata, operating systems Windows, Linux and various attack types on system resource usage, dropped packets rate and ability to detect intrusions. The results show that Suricata has a higher CPU and RAM utilization than Snort in all cases on both operating systems, but lower percentage of dropped packets when evaluated during five of six simulated attacks. Both products had the same number of correctly identified intrusions. The results show that Linux-based solutions consume more system resources, but Windows-based systems had a higher rate of dropped packets. This indicates that these two intrusion detection and prevention systems should be run on Linux.

More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address.

An organization with hundreds of workstations does not necessarily imply that it has the opportunity to form an ad-hoc computer cluster because different workstations may have different turned-on durations and these workstations may not be available at the same time depending on their users' usage. The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations.

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test.

In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream.

Especially, we assess MMT to deal with a practical case-study in which we analyze the User-Agent field in HTTP headers to determine abnormal activities. Indeed, novel observations figure out the usefulness of the User-Agent field in HTTP requests as a good source to facilitate abnormal activities detection within an abundant traffic. There are eventually several researches alarming the vulnerabilities of the User-Agent field and proposing some manual solution including a combination of tools. However, existing countermeasures are rather passive and do not allow real-time detection. In the context of our research, MMT provides an automated detection of malicious traffic abusing vulnerable User-Agent field. Analyzing abnormal User-Agent strings is also useful to rapidly detect existing evil objects in the network (e.g., bots).

Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like network behavior analyses (NBA) systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time. To overcome these shortcomings, we are introducing a fast-learning modular neural network based on pre-processed components.

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Bandwidth;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Quality of service;Resource management;Security;Switches","","","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a promising solution as a conventional cost-effective accelerator for use in a high-end router.

The goal is to build a framework that exposes tools and methods for a centralized processing of IEEE 802.11 frames. In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization.

In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics.

We discuss the Portall visualization, the supporting infrastructure it requires, and a formative usability study we conducted to obtain administrators' reactions to the tool.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532061","","Computer security;Data security;Data visualization;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Sockets;Telecommunication traffic;Usability","computer network management;data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security","Network Eye framework;Portall visualization;anomalous communication patterns;computer security;computer system intrusion;information visualization;network activity monitoring;network traffic;system administration;visual correlation","","5","","17","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous fault-tolerant approaches have been proposed to effectively achieve this objective in the presence of crash failures. However, such systems struggle with transient late-timing faults -- a fault classification challenging to effectively tolerate -- that manifests increasingly within large-scale distributed systems. Such faults represent a significant threat towards minimizing soft real-time execution of streaming applications in the presence of failures. This work proposes a fault-tolerant approach for QoS-aware data prediction to tolerate transient late-timing faults. The approach is capable of determining the most effective data prediction algorithm for imposed QoS constraints on a failed stream processor at run-time. We integrated our approach into Apache Storm with experiment results showing its ability to minimize stream processor end-to-end execution time by 61% compared to other fault-tolerant approaches. The approach incurs 12% additional CPU utilization while reducing network usage by 44%.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515618","Cloud computing;Data Prediction;Fault-tolerance;Stream Processing","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques build intrusion detection models adaptively. Random forests is an efficient data mining algorithm which can be used for network intrusion detection This can be used for real time intrusion detection.

Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks. The implementation is carried out on an experimental testbed build up on Linux machines and Virtual routers. The experimental results show that there is considerable increase in the host and network based performance metrics for legitimate users even under DoS and DDoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-1599-9;9781467315999","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206744","Distributed Denial of Service attack;host and network based performance metrics;rate limiting;virtual router","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Internet;Limiting;Measurement;Monitoring;Throughput","Linux;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack;DDoS detection;IBRL;Linux machines;critical infrastructure availability;critical infrastructure confidentiality;critical infrastructure integrity;cyber society;distributed denial of service attacks;experimental testbed;host-network based metrics;host-network based mitigation;interface based rate limiting algorithm;network performance metrics online measurement;real time attack traffic online analysis;virtual routers","","3","","15","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It demands a large number of computer resources, such as CPU time and memory. Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS.

In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks. In this paper, we show that the robustness and reliability of generic SIP servers is inadequate than commonly perceived. We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks.

The approach relies on a tool, called MNEMOSYNE, that maintains a sliding window containing the traffic that has been recently seen on a network link. MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide incident analysis functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs.

Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368559","Command injection;Cyber-physical attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decision tree;Denial of service (DoS);Intrusion detection;Mobile robots;Network security","Computer crime;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Robot kinematics;Vehicles","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;decision trees;mobile robots;security of data;telerobotics;vehicles","attack behaviours;automobiles;command injection attacks;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision tree-based detection;denial of service attacks;detection rules;disk data;drones;false positive rate;intrusion detection systems;mobile cyber-physical systems;network traffic;physical input features;physical jittering;power consumption;security;small remote-controlled robotic vehicle","","","","28","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6;9781424474226","978-1-4244-7421-9;9781424474219","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However little has been done to use a control-theoretic approach for SDN and NFV management. In this demo, we describe a use case for NFV management using control theory and SDN. We use the management architecture of RINA (a clean-slate Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) to manage Virtual Network Function (VNF) instances over the GENI testbed. We deploy Snort, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as the VNF. Our network topology has source and destination hosts, multiple IDSes, an Open vSwitch (OVS) and an OpenFlow controller. A distributed management application running on RINA measures the state of the VNF instances and communicates this information to a Proportional Integral (PI) controller, which then provides load balancing information to the OpenFlow controller. The latter controller in turn updates traffic flow forwarding rules on the OVS switch, thus balancing load across the VNF instances. This demo demonstrates the benefits of using such a control-theoretic load balancing approach and the RINA management architecture in virtualized environments for NFV management. It also illustrates that the GENI testbed can easily support a wide range of SDN and NFV related experiments.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502945","","Computer architecture;Control systems;Control theory;Intrusion detection;Load management;Monitoring;Round robin","","","","","","8","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources. This paper will provide a brief overview of the Digital Ants framework and then present results from testbed-based demonstrations that show how Digital Ants can identify a cyber security attack scenario against smart meter deployments.","","978-1-4673-4894-2;9781467348942","978-1-4673-4895-9;9781467348959","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497880","Agents;Bio-inspired;Computer security;Cyber security;Smart Grid;Smart meters","Bandwidth;Computer security;Grippers;Load flow;Smart grids;Smart meters","adaptive control;control engineering computing;mobile agents;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","bioinspired cyber security;centralized security techniques;complex-adaptive control systems;digital ant framework;digital pheromones;electric distribution systems;electric power system;interagent communication;limited computational resources;mobile agents;security risks;smart grid deployments;smart meter deployments;social insects;testbed-based demonstrations","","4","","17","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.","","978-1-4673-8050-8;9781467380508","","10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325234","DDoS Attacks;Flow Base IP Traceback;Network Security;Probabilistic Flow Marking","Computer crime;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Network interfaces;Probabilistic logic","Internet;computer network security","CAIDA archives;IP traceback scheme;IP traceback schemes;Internet;NAT;PFM;anonymous flooding attacks;distributed-denial-of-service attacks;network address translation;probabilistic flow marking;proxy device;security issues;source IP address spoofing;spoofed source IP addresses","","","","20","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

Among the possible approaches to improve the current situation, expert systems have been advocated to be an important one. Typical tasks that such expert systems attempt to achieve include finding system vulnerabilities and detecting malicious behaviour of users. We extend our intrusion detection system ASAX with a deductive subsystem that allows us to assess the security level of a software configuration on a real time basis. By coupling the two subsystems-intrusion detection and configuration analysis-we moreover achieve a better tuning of the intrusion detection since the system has only to enable intrusion detection rules that are specifically required by the current state of the configuration.

The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility.

To enhance security in <i>ad hoc</i> networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of other nodes without central authorities. An information-theoretic framework is presented, to quantitatively measure trust and build a novel trust model (FAPtrust) with multiple trust decision factors. These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

Most of this profile data is currently based on command-line instructions/directives executed by users on a system. With the advent and extensive usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line data can no longer fully represent user's complete behavior which is essential for effectively detecting the anomalies in these GUI based systems. Collection of user behavior data is a slow and time consuming process. In this paper, we present a new approach to automate the generation of user data by parameterizing user behavior in terms of user intention (malicious/normal), user skill level, set of applications installed on a machine, mouse movement and keyboard activity. The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized. The framework is called USim which can achieve rapid generation of user behavior data based on these templates for GUI based systems. The data thus generated can be utilized for rapidly training and testing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and improving their detection precision.","1080-241X;1080241X","0-7695-2559-8;0769525598","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612860","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data engineering;Discrete event simulation;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Keyboards;Laboratories;Mice;System testing","graphical user interfaces;security of data","IDSes;USim;anomaly detection system;graphical user interface;intrusion detection system;user behavior simulation","","1","1","25","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the resource constraints, the intrusion detection system for traditional network cannot be used directly in WSNs. Several schemes have been proposed to detect intrusions in wireless sensor networks. But most of them aim on some specific attacks (e.g. selective forwarding) or attacks on particular layers, such as media access layer or routing layer. In this paper, we present a framework of machine learning based intrusion detection system for wireless sensor networks.

In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies.

However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern.

Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work. This research work focus on applying the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on the classifiers to network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Unlike the other implementations, both temporal and spatial enc- ding information is considered here. It helps in identifying the complex behavior patterns.","","978-1-4799-6804-6;9781479968046","","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218129","Genetic algorithm;Knowledge base;bayesian classifier;intrusion detection system","Encoding;Engines;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sociology;Statistics","Bayes methods;firewalls;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Bayesian classifier;GA;IDS;complex behavior pattern identification;computer security;data integrity;dynamic defense system;external intruders;firewall technology;genetic algorithm;information system;internal intruders;learning systems;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusion identification;predetermined rule set;probabilistic techniques;security management system;spatial encoding information;system availability;temporal encoding information","","0","","10","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present the basic ideas, discuss the main implementation issues, and perform a preliminary experimental campaign.

In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation.

We discuss a detailed threat model to mobile devices in the real world to develop an ACM fitted to mobile devices. Then, we propose a novel multi-layer access control mechanism for mobile devices, which provides strong protection against the identified mobile threats as well as performance efficiency. Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-1456-7;9781424414567","978-1-4244-1457-4;9781424414574","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance. We also discuss the effects of the reloading of splitting policies on packet duplication rate and on the load on the sensors.","","0-7803-8325-7;0780383257","","10.1109/INCC.2004.1366575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366575","","Adaptive systems;Educational institutions;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Scalability;Sensor systems;Statistics;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;SNORT intrusion detection system;adaptive load balancing architecture;load disparity;management console;multi sensor intrusion detection systems;packet duplication rate minimization;traffic splitting policies","","0","","8","","","11-13 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion.

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable. In this paper we design and implement a preliminary intrusion detection system (IDS) for WSNs that addresses the security concern of DoS attacks and fits the demands and restrictions of WSNs.","2154-0357;21540357","978-1-4244-0940-2;9781424409402","978-1-4244-0941-9;9781424409419","10.1109/EIT.2007.4374444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374444","Attack;Denial of Service (DoS);Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Network","Batteries;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Event detection;Floods;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","denial of service attacks;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","5","","15","","","17-20 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

In the proposed semantic IDS, an object is defined as an occurrence of an elementary pattern represented by a regular expression which may not be malicious. However occurrence of combination of some of these objects may represent a malicious behavior of the user. A rule is defined such that it will be triggered whenever a particular set of objects occurs or whenever a specific sequence of object occurs. The rules and the objects are bonded together in Lex tool and integrated with the IDS engine. Given a set of rules (each dictating a number of constraints that the input data must fulfill to trigger it) the IDS engine will find malicious events using as few redundant comparisons as possible. IDS implementation is done in Linux platform using Lex and Yacc tools. The system was implemented completely in web environment and the results are presented with performance analysis.","","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447204","","HTML;Internet;Intrusion detection;Java;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines;Signal analysis;Signal processing","Linux;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","IDS engine;Lex tools;Linux platform;Web environment;Yacc tools;application layer intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system engine;malicious events;performance analysis;protocol analysis","","0","","7","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security and privacy is a major hurdle in its success because of its open and distributed architecture that is vulnerable to intruders. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most commonly used mechanism to detect attacks on cloud. This paper provides an overview of different intrusions in cloud. Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to evaluate whether they fulfill the security requirements of cloud computing environment or not. We emphasize the deployment of IDS that uses multiple detection methods to cope with security challenges in cloud.","","978-1-4799-1287-2;9781479912872","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725325","Anomaly;Cloud Computing;Cloud Security;Intrusion Detection System;Signature","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;computer crime;data privacy","IDS;IT organization;attacks detection;cloud based intrusion detection systems;cloud computing;data source;detection technique;detection time;distributed architecture;open architecture;pay-per-use based services;positioning;privacy;security requirements","","3","","29","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main issue was addressed based on the behavioral patterns of worms that reflect application communications typical of worms. This representation of worm's behavior differs from those used in contemporary enterprise postures, which reliance on a particular type of signature-based intrusion detection and the behavioral detection approach contrasts from this form of signature-based detection. Thus, this paper introduced the traditional worm's detection approaches. Meanwhile, the paper suggested a worm detection approach based on worm behaviors that consist on network scanning detection approach, network worm's correlation approach, and signature correlation approach.","","978-1-61284-705-4;9781612847054","978-0-7695-4376-5;9780769543765","10.1109/UKSIM.2011.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754246","IDS;Signature detection;Worm's detection approach;correlation approach","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Computers;Correlation;Grippers;Internet","computer network security;invasive software","network scanning detection;network worm correlation;signature correlation;worm behavior;worms detection","","0","","14","","","March 30 2011-April 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.","1098-7584;10987584","978-1-4244-6919-2;9781424469192","","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584418","","Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Correlation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols","security of data","collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system;computer attacks;false positives;fuzzy alert correlation;fuzzy logic","","2","","25","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To deal with this issue, we built our system based on an in-memory data base with an integrated machine learning library, namely SAP HANA. Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time. To prove our concepts, we measured the processing speed for the developed system on the data generated using Active Directory tested and showed the efficiency of our approach for high-speed analysis of security events.","2379-5352;23795352","978-1-4673-7147-6;9781467371476","","10.1109/ISPDC.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165133","SAP HANA;in-memory;intrusion detection;machine learning;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Databases;Libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Security","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","SAP HANA;active directory;computational-heavy algorithms;data analysis;deep log message normalisation;high-speed security analytics;high-speed security event analysis;in-memory database;in-memory machine learning engine;integrated machine learning library;machine learning analysis;security information and event management systems","","1","","27","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the current IDS work by detecting patterns of behavior of previously known attacks (attack signature). One drawback of signature based IDS is that they are vulnerable to previously unknown attacks. As an alternative, anomaly based IDS use a model of what is considered a normal behavior of a computer system or network and then they could detect any attack, know or unknown. The main problem of this approach is to find an adequate model of normality. In this paper, we present a method to build a model of behavior of computer network and systems. In this model a set of fuzzy organizational states are deduced from time series of computer resources utilization applying the discrete fuzzy transform.","Pending","978-1-61284-968-3;9781612849683","978-1-61284-967-6;9781612849676","10.1109/NAFIPS.2011.5751919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751919","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computers;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Transforms","computer network security;digital signatures;fuzzy set theory;transforms","attack signature;computer anomaly detection;computer networks;computer resources utilization;computer system;discrete fuzzy transform;fuzzy organizational states;information security control;intrusion detection systems","","0","","16","","","18-20 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
