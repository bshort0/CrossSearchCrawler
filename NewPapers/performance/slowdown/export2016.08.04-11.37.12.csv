Over the past decade several DPI systems have evolved targeting specific issues related to traffic management, user/application policing, intrusion detection/prevention, URL/malicious/unwanted content filtering. Snort, OpenDPI, Bro, L7-filter, ClamAV are a number of open-source tools based on custom DPI engines and custom rule-sets. The surging demand for higher bandwidth DPI systems capable of supporting larger rule-sets requires the use of hardware acceleration and hardware-based systems. In comparison to software based systems, the design and development of custom purpose hardware for DPI is expensive. The need for DPI solutions for a range of applications at high speed requires a unified processing platform. This paper presents the research in converting known DPI rule-sets into a meta format based on regular expressions, that can be executed by software and hardware-based processing platforms. To demonstrate this work a Snort2Regex translator has been developed to transform Snort rules into regular expressions using not only the content of the Snort rule but every relevant element that belongs to it and could increase the accuracy of the analysis.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5963095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963095","","Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Syntactics","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;inspection;public domain software;telecommunication traffic","Bro;ClamAV;Internet traffic inspection;L7-filter;OpenDPI;Snort2Regex translator;URL content filtering;application policing;hardware acceleration;hardware-based processing platform;hardware-based system;high speed network;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;layer-7 content analysis;malicious content filtering;meta format;open-source tools;rule based deep packet inspection;software-based processing platform;traffic management;unwanted content filtering;user policing","","2","","12","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6;9781479979806","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8;9781457714498","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the effects of routing attacks on multi-path routing have not been addressed. In this paper, the performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in detail. The results show that multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks. A simple scheme based on statistical analysis (called SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. Comparing to the previous approaches (for example, using packet leash), no special requirements (such as time synchronization or GPS) are needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with different topologies and with different node transmission range. Moreover, SAM may act as a module in local detection agents in an intrusion detection system (IDS) for wireless ad hoc networks.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420257","","Ad hoc networks;Counting circuits;Electric variables measurement;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;multipath channels;routing protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;malicious node location;multipath routing;routing protocol;statistical analysis;wireless ad hoc network;wormhole attack detection","","24","","26","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect such sophisticated scans we propose the integration of algorithmic detection and visualization for human detection to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The proposed approach provides real world detection capabilities without excessive computation overhead.

"Synchronized Co-migration of Virtual Machines for IDS Offloading in Clouds","K. Kourai; H.

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection.

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2321-2;9781479923212","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we apply a light-weight watermarking technique to defend against false data injection attacks. To be specific, we add a secure watermark to real-time meter readings and transmit the watermarked data through high speed unsecured network. The utility can then correlate the watermarked data with the original watermark to detect the presence of false data injected by adversary.

Addressing these problems, the concept of high level security policy management is proposed for large networks. To support high level policy management and collaborative management of multi-vendor firewalls, a definition for a common firewall MIB (CFWMIB) and a common format for the TRAP events record are proposed.

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","0-7803-9410-0;0780394100","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","20","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules.

Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","35","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones.

It utilizes the multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data. The original message to be secured is split into parts that are transmitted in multiple paths.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235","","Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols","Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes","DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol","","21","","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many mission-critic sensor network applications demand an effective, light, flexible algorithm for internal adversary identification with only localized information available. The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","7","4","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user.

In this work we conduct a complex experiment to expand our understanding of forensics analysis processes. During a period of four weeks we systematically investigated 200 detected security incidents about compromised hosts within a large operational network. We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences. For example, we observe that good signatures check on average 2.14 times more bytes and 2.3 times more fields than regular signatures. Our analysis of Snort signatures is essential not only for configuring Snort, but also for establishing best practices and for teaching how to write new IDS signatures.","","978-1-4799-0458-7;9781479904587","","10.1109/SPW.2013.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565238","IDS;Infections;Malware;Network forensics","Correlators;Forensics;Malware;Manuals;Reconnaissance;Search engines","digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software;search engines","IDS signatures;Snort alerts;Snort signatures;blacklists;evidence collection;evidence correlation;malware;network forensics analysis;operational environment;reconnaissance;search engine;security data sources;security incident manual forensics investigation;vulnerability scanners","","4","","25","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection Scheme for Hierarchical WSNs","A. Al-Riyami; N. Zhang; J. Keane","School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.","IEEE Access","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Node compromise attacks pose a serious threat to WSNs. To launch an attack, an adversary physically captures a node and access data or software stored on the node. Even worse, the adversary may redeploy the captured node back into the network and use it to launch further attacks. To reduce the impact of a node compromise attack on network operations, the network should detect a node compromise as early as possible, ideally soon after a node is being captured, and then isolate the node from future network communications. Solutions for early node compromise detection are based on distributed monitoring of neighbouring nodes’ aliveness. Nodes regularly send notification (Heartbeat) messages to their one-hop neighbors to indicate their aliveness. If no message is received from a node (i.e., if a node is not heard) for a certain period of time, then the unheard node is said to have been compromised. This approach may have a large number of false positive errors when the message loss ratio in the network is high, as missing messages could be caused by message loss during transmission, in addition to node compromises. This paper proposes a novel scheme, called an Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection (AdaptENCD) scheme, to facilitate node compromise attack detection in a cluster-based WSN. The scheme is designed to achieve a low false positive ratio in the presence of various levels of message loss ratios. To achieve this feature, two ideas are used in the design. The first is to use cluster-based collective decision making to detect node compromises. The second is to dynamically adjust the rate of notification message transmissions in response to the message loss ratio in the sender’s neighborhood. The performance of the scheme, in terms of false positive ratio, false negative ratio and transmission overheads, is evaluated using simulation. The results are compared against those from the most relevant scheme in the literature. The comparison results show- that our scheme can detect all the node compromises in the network more effectively and efficiently, regardless of the message loss ratio in the underlying environment.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2594478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530851","Node compromise attack;Wireless Sensor Networks;adaptive;detection","Adaptation models;Network security;Propagation losses;Telecommunication network management;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","2016-08-03","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, malicious nodes in a wireless and mobile ad hoc environment can jeopardize the security of the network if the issues of secure data exchange are not properly handled. Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks. In our protocol, only trustworthy nodes are allowed to participate in communications and the misbehavior of malicious nodes is thus prevented effectively. We describe our protocol and provide its performance evaluation based on simulation experiments implemented in an ns-2 simulator. Compared to the SDAR protocol, our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme not only achieves the necessary anonymity in mobile ad hoc networks, but also provides more security with reasonably little additional overhead.","0742-1303;07421303","0-7695-3000-1;0769530001","978-0-7695-3000-0;9780769530000","10.1109/LCN.2007.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4367930","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Data security;Identity-based encryption;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anonymous routing protocol;encryption;mobile ad hoc network;mobile agent;network security;ns-2 simulator;performance evaluation;wireless sensor network","","2","","28","","","15-18 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of ""soft IP cores,"" often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892","Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization","Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation","NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks","","0","","37","","2015-07-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","7","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we describe a proof-of-concept server backdoor which hides the in- and exfiltration of data in incoming and outgoing benign traffic of the victim server. Using a low-traffic system call proxy, our backdoor allows the remote execution of arbitrary programs on the victim server without being detectable by network intrusion detection systems.

This demands for an effective mechanism to establish trust among participants in a high-level abstract way, capturing relevant factors ranging on Service Level Agreement, security policies, requirements, regulations, constraints, Quality of Service, reputation, and recommendation. Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey. This survey examines and explores the role of trust in service workflows and their contexts from a wide variety of literatures. Various mechanisms, architecture, techniques, standards, and frameworks are explained along the way with discussions. Working trust definition and classification are newly provided and supported with examples.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072811.00081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5989901","Security;Trust;Wowkflows","Companies;Context;Permission;Reliability","Internet;security of data","Internet technology;distributed environments;quality of service;security policies;security solutions;service level agreement;service workflow trust;service-based interactions","","3","","230","","2011-08-18","Third Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a matter of fact, various actors utilise the Internet for illicit purposes, such as for performing Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) and for spreading various types of aggressive malware. Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems etc.). This paper presents PROTOS (PROactive Threat Observatory System), an early warning system which is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet, using both a global and a local approach. The proposed system is therefore able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912624","","Computer architecture;Grippers;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;invasive software","DDoS;Internet threat level measurement;PROTOS;aggressive malware;antivirus software;complex system;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed system;early warning system;global-local approach;illicit purposes;intrusion detection systems;offline statistical sampling;proactive threat observatory system;security applications;sensors;threat level estimation","","1","","17","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
