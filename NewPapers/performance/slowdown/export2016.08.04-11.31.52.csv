The behavior of the system is defined in terms of a ""behavior set"" rather than using a single parameter. This facilitates greater accuracy in describing the behavior of the system and helps in reducing false-positives.

However, many problems are still not well resolved in most of IDS, such as detection evasion, intrusion containment. In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the security policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.","","978-0-7695-3090-1;9780769530901","","10.1109/WKDD.2008.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470467","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Open source software;Prototypes;Software engineering","authorisation;software architecture;virtual machines","detection evasion;intrusion containment;intrusion detection domain;intrusion detection system;security policies;system resource;unauthorized access prevention;virtual machine monitor","","2","","22","","","23-24 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an effort to solve this problem, researchers have explored different methods of visualizing network security threats. There is little debate that humans can perceive more information visually than textually. The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification. Many different security tools make up a security analyst's tool kit.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4577-2027-7;9781457720277","978-1-4577-2026-0;9781457720260","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","2","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization has a key role in supporting the IaaS model. However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform.

In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns.

It is important to design new approaches and mechanisms to rise the security these networks and protect them from attacks. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection mechanism for the VANETs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

The Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) such as malware, rootkit, spyware, etc. are more potent to bypass the existing defense mechanisms designed for VM. To address this issue, Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) emerged as a promising approach that monitors run state of the VM externally from hypervisor. However, limitation of VMI lies with semantic gap. An open source tool called LibVMI address the semantic gap. Memory Forensic Analysis (MFA) tool such as Volatility can also be used to address the semantic gap. But, it needs to capture a memory dump (RAM) as input. Memory dump acquires time and its analysis time is highly crucial if Intrusion Detection System IDS (IDS) depends on the data supplied by FAM or VMI tool. In this work, live virtual machine RAM dump acquire time of LibVMI is measured. In addition, captured memory dump analysis time consumed by Volatility is measured and compared with other memory analyzer such as Rekall. It is observed through experimental results that, Rekall takes more execution time as compared to Volatility for most of the plugins. Further, Volatility and Rekall are compared with LibVMI. It is noticed that examining the volatile data through LibVMI is faster as it eliminates memory dump acquire time.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384310","Hypervisor;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Forensic Analysis;Rootkit;Semantic gap;Virtual Machine Introspection","Kernel;Malware;Random access memory;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","digital forensics;invasive software;public domain software;storage management;virtual machines;virtualisation","LibVMI open source tool;advanced persistent threats;captured memory dump analysis;execution time measurement;hypervisor;intrusion detection system;live virtual machine RAM dump;malware;memory forensic analysis tool;rootkit;semantic gap;spyware;virtual infrastructure privileged access;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine volatile artifact analyzers;virtualization environment","","","","28","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);Tutorials;application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","6","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network is through a series of exploits, where each exploit in the series satisfies the pre-condition for subsequent exploits and makes a causal relationship among them. Such a series of exploits constitutes an attack path and the set of all possible attack paths form an attack graph. Present day vulnerability scanners are able to identify the vulnerabilities in isolation but there is a need for correlation among these vulnerabilities to identify overall risk of the network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by finding out an attack path consisting of logically connected exploits and extends it to an attack graph. The solution also finds out the set of root cause vulnerabilities for overall security threat while taking care the inherent time and scalability problem of attack graph generation.","","0-7695-3072-9;0769530729","978-0-7695-3072-7;9780769530727","10.1109/CIS.2007.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415455","","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Binary decision diagrams;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Equations;Information security;Information technology;Risk management;Scalability","","","","0","","12","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures.

DATMS adopts on-line analysis instead of post-mortem analysis to reduce the trace time. In addition, the packet filter controller which adapts to queue length is proposed to mitigate the DDoS attacks.

However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","1","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system will also be used to test the hypothesis that an effective defense against fast, distributed information attacks requires rapid, coordinated, network-wide responses. The core components of the architecture are a run-time infrastructure (RTI), a communication language, a system model, and defensive components. The RTI incorporates a number of innovative design concepts and provides fast, reliable, exploitation-resistant communication and coordination services to the components defending the network, even when challenged by a distributed attack.

It uses trust values to favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding intermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we provide link-layer security using the CBC-X mode of authentication and encryption.

In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities.

These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics.

This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial.

IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different existing IDS architectures for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANETs, this architecture is a combination model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA).

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS).

In this paper, we report our progress in the development of an agent-based cooperative anomaly detection scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. The approach addresses the underlying distributed and cooperative nature of wireless ad hoc networks and adds one more dimension of cooperation to the intrusion detection process. That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes.

NFV allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and present relationships between NFV and SDN.

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

Such behaviour, known as packet dropping, results of nodespsila selfishness or maliciousness and has dramatic effects on networks performances. Most of proposed solutions to counter packet dropping are either based on trust management or multipath routing, but no solution combines both trust management and multipath routing. Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a security framework which adapts security to the application requirements; evaluates trustworthy relationship based on localized trust model and efficiently combines multipath routing into trust management. In this paper we study ASMA performance against the most classical and simple packet dropping attack: Black Hole attack. Aiming to evaluate ASMA in dense networks, we use a realistic scenario representing a subway environment which brings interesting features and may be a prolific context for MANET application development. Through simulations we compare the performances of DSR and ASMA associated to DSR in attacked pure MANETs.

We propose novel approaches for storage-based intrusion detection and discuss how features of state-of-the-art block storage systems can be used for intrusion detection and recovery of compromised data. In particular we present two prototype systems. First we present a real time intrusion detection system (IDS), which has been integrated within a storage management and virtualization system. In this system incoming requests for storage blocks are examined for signs of intrusions in real time. We then discuss how intrusion detection schemes can be deployed as an appliance loosely coupled with a SAN storage system. The major advantage of this approach is that it does not require any modification and enhancement to the storage system software. In this approach, we use the space and time efficient point-in-time copy operation provided by SAN storage devices.

The issue of how often rekey operations should be performed, however, has not been addressed. In this paper, we develop a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model to identify the optimal batch rekey interval to minimize periodic rekey overhead while satisfying application-specific constraints in rekey delay and secrecy violation.

However, ATMs incur a significant significant cost overhead in the form of capital and operational costs. The problem of ATM location is further complicated as customers of one bank can use their debit cards at any other bank's ATMs. While this might attract charges, some banks often refund these charges to attract customers. Banks need to have a mechanism to quantitatively measure the benefits of managing their own ATM versus paying for services rendered to it's customers by other banks through their ATMs. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making and is an effective technique to identify the best business strategy when provided with multiple options. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model based on stochastic games to identify the best strategy to be adopted by banks for their ATM expansion. We further propose an algorithm to identify the idle locations where a bank should place an ATM should the result of the ATM game recommend that the bank should establish it's own ATM.","","978-1-4673-8492-6;9781467384926","","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395687","ATM Placement;GIS;Game Theory;Stochastic Games","Game theory;Games;Online banking;Stochastic processes;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","automatic teller machines;bank data processing;decision making;stochastic games","ATM expansion;ATM game;ATM location;ATM services;banking services;business strategy;cash deposit;cash withdrawal;stochastic game theoretic model;strategic decision making","","","","23","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Data Processing on FPGAs","J. Teubner; L. Woods","","Data Processing on FPGAs","20140702","2013","","","","","Roughly a decade ago, power consumption and heat dissipation concerns forced the semiconductor industry to radically change its course, shifting from sequential to parallel computing. Unfortunately, improving performance of applications has now become much more difficult than in the good old days of frequency scaling. This is also affecting databases and data processing applications in general, and has led to the popularity of so-called data appliances—specialized data processing engines, where software and hardware are sold together in a closed box. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) increasingly play an important role in such systems. FPGAs are attractive because the performance gains of specialized hardware can be significant, while power consumption is much less than that of commodity processors. On the other hand, FPGAs are way more flexible than hard-wired circuits (ASICs) and can be integrated into complex systems in many different ways, e.g., directly in the network for a high-frequency trading application. This book gives an introduction to FPGA technology targeted at a database audience. In the first few chapters, we explain in detail the inner workings of FPGAs. Then we discuss techniques and design patterns that help mapping algorithms to FPGA hardware so that the inherent parallelism of these devices can be leveraged in an optimal way. Finally, the book will illustrate a number of concrete examples that exploit different advantages of FPGAs for data processing.

When compared to wired and base station-based wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider and outsider attacks. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined defense perimeter. In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","1","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857;10609857","978-1-4577-1349-1;9781457713491","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work is not aimed to replace existing security solutions although it builds upon it to complement it and enhance existing methods. We utilise the timeliness of the Internet of Things as a focus to develop and experiment with our work. In this paper we present our novel framework. The novelty lies within the way the three components are integrated within it to provide scaleable security. The results we present prove its feasibility to enhance current security to be more efficient and dynamic to protect a broad number of devices on future networks.","","978-1-5090-0153-8;9781509001538","","10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363312","Collaborative;Internet of Things;Network security;in-network;malware detection;mobile security;smartphone","Collaboration;Computers;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Security","data protection;personal computing;security of data","Internet of Things;network security models;personal computing protection","","","","12","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, the availability of these ubiquitous and mobile services has significantly increased due to the different form of connectivity provided by mobile devices, such as GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools. With this categorization we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the underlying model adopted by each approach.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2012.013012.00028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170530","Intrusion Detection;Mobile Malware;Mobile Security;Trusted Mobile","Bluetooth;Malware;Mobile communication;Network security;Smart phones;Trojan horses","invasive software;smart phones;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing","IDS-based models;communication channels;malware writers;mobile devices;mobile services;security;smart phones;ubiquitous services","","37","","165","","2012-03-15","First Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Measurements are essential to analyze the performance of wireless protocols such as IEEE 802.11 networks in real environments, but experimentations are complex to perform and analyze. Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope. Finally, we discuss with several case studies the combination of tools that best suit the needs of the wireless experiments and provide a list of common pitfalls to avoid.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2010.021110.00020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451769","IEEE 802.11;open source software;probes;wireless analyzers;wireless measurements;wireless parameters","","mathematical analysis;probes;protocols;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters;mathematical analysis;open source measurement tools;taxonomy;wireless cards;wireless network protocols;wireless traffic probes","","7","2","55","","2010-04-19","Second Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This can be a complex task. In this article we describe an integrated framework for the design, evaluation, and deployment of network resilience strategies. These strategies describe the management behavior of a number of federated, policy-controlled resilience mechanisms, such as monitoring and detection systems.

In this paper, we start by an analysis of connection sojourn time distribution of network traffic. Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion. Then we propose a connection scheduling policy in stateful packet inspection systems called LASF (least attained sojourn first).

This paper reviews ISP-level address sharing mechanisms, which allow Internet service providers to connect multiple customers who share a single IPv4 address. Some mechanisms come with severe and unpredicted consequences, and all of them come with tradeoffs. We propose a novel classification, which we apply to existing mechanisms such as NAT444 and DS-Lite and proposals such as 4rd, MAP, etc. Our tradeoff analysis reveals insights into many problems including: abuse attribution, performance degradation, address and port usage efficiency, direct intercustomer communication, and availability.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2256147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504560","Address family translation;IPv4 address sharing;IPv6 transition;address plus port (A+P);carrier grade NAT (CGN);network address translation (NAT)","","IP networks;Internet","DS-Lite;IANA-level IPv4 address exhaustion;IPv4 address sharing mechanism classification;IPv4 reachability;IPv6 deployment;IPv6-only Internet;ISP-level address sharing mechanisms;Internet service providers;NAT444;abuse attribution;address efficiency;direct intercustomer communication;performance degradation;port usage efficiency","","1","","62","","2013-04-17","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we analyze the SIP protocol and show that it can easily be exploited to mount effective and large-scale botnets. We do this by scrutinizing the details of the SIP protocol and show how it offers a variety of ways to conceal botnet traffic within legitimate-looking SIP traffic. Using our analysis, we implement a SIP bot and present experimental results from a real testbed network. In addition, we employ traffic statistics collected from a large telecommunication provider and discuss the implications for both botnet design and detection. Finally, we present a software tool (called autosip) to generate synthetic traffic that resembles actual SIP traffic with different controllable characteristics.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681;15228681","978-1-4673-5956-6;9781467359566","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","4","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","1530-0889;15300889","978-1-4244-4422-9;9781424444229","978-1-4244-4421-2;9781424444212","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","28","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevancies for the applications, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. We propose a semi-reliable energy-efficient hop-by-hop retransmission mechanism, where the reliability level of each packet is function of the relevance of the source nodes associated with DWT subbands. Doing so, some of the corrupted packets will not be retransmitted, saving energy of intermediate nodes with low impact to the visual monitoring quality.","2154-0217;21540217","978-1-4673-0761-1;9781467307611","978-1-4673-0760-4;9781467307604","10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6328419","energy-efficient retransmission;error control;sensing relevance;wireless image sensor networks","Discrete wavelet transforms;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Sensors;Strontium;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","discrete wavelet transforms;multimedia communication;telecommunication network reliability;visual communication;wireless sensor networks","DWT subbands;corrupted packets;discrete wavelet transform;energy consumption;intermediate nodes;packet error;packet reliability level;packet retransmissions;received image quality;semireliable energy-efficient hop-by-hop retransmission mechanism;sensing relevancies;source nodes;transmission reliability;visual information retrieval;visual monitoring quality;wireless image sensor networks","","0","","11","","","28-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Rejecting the attack: Source authentication for Wi-Fi management frames using CSI Information","Z. Jiang; J. Zhao; X. Y. Li; J. Han; W. Xi","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'An, China","INFOCOM, 2013 Proceedings IEEE","20130725","2013","","","2544","2552","Comparing to well protected data frames, Wi-Fi management frames (MFs) are extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method. We observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-5944-3;9781467359443","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567061","","Authentication;Cryptography;Decorrelation;IEEE 802.11n Standard;OFDM","telecommunication channels;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11n;CSI information;CSITE;PHY layer;RSS-based method;Txpower;Wi-Fi management frames;Wi-Fi sniffers;channel dynamics;channel state information;rapid spatial decorrelation;source authentication;user mobility","","5","","29","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
