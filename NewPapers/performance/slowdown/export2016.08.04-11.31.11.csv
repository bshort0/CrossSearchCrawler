This work describes how the visualization of raw IDS alert data assists network administrators in understanding the current state of a network and quickens the process of reviewing and responding to intrusion attempts. The project presented in this work consists of three primary components. The first component provides a visual mapping of the network topology that allows the end-user to easily browse clustered alerts. The second component is based on the flocking behavior of birds such that birds tend to follow other birds with similar behaviors. This component allows the end-user to see the clustering process and provides an efficient means for reviewing alert data. The third component discovers and visualizes patterns of multistage attacks by profiling the attacker's behaviors.","","978-1-4244-8439-3;9781424484393","978-0-7695-4211-9;9780769542119","10.1109/SocialCom.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591472","clustering;flocking;intrusion detection;visulization","Association rules;Data visualization;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Visualization","data visualisation;network topology;pattern clustering;security of data","alert analysis;attack visualization;attacker behavior;clustering process;flocking behavior;network administrator;network based intrusion detection system;network topology;visual mapping","","5","","20","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To provide a proof-of-concept of our thesis, we design and implement our system as a kernel module in Linux. We perform the time series analysis of 118 parameters of Linux task structures and pre-process them to come up with a minimal features' set of 11 features. Our analysis show that these features have remarkably different values for benign and malicious processes; as a result, a number of classifiers operating on these features provide 93% detection accuracy with 0% false alarm rate within 100 milliseconds.

State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented.

Among those attacks routing attack is the most severe one. To systematically cope up with this routing attack, Risk Aware Response Mechanism is used. In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted. AEF considers both static approach as well as dynamic conditions in order to achieve better security and allow only secure communication to takes place between source and destination.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508360","Authorization Enforcement Facility;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Networks;Risk Aware;security","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","authorisation;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","IDS;MANET;authorization enforcement facility;dynamic conditions;dynamic infrastructure;malicious nodes;network administrator;risk aware response mechanism;routing attack;secure access;static based approach;temporary decision","","0","","13","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security mechanisms are important for cluster computing, especially when clusters are part of high-assurance systems. In this paper, we discuss security requirements for cluster-computing environments, with an emphasis on access control. A security solution is proposed based on the role-based access control (RBAC) model. Within an RBAC security model, roles are identified for different job assignments. Users are assigned roles according to their job functions. Required permissions are associated with each role. An example illustrates the coordination between the RBAC model and security sensors for cluster computing. RBAC is well suited to a cluster-computing environment and can be readily integrated with various security configurations.","1530-1605;15301605","0-7695-2268-8;0769522688","","10.1109/HICSS.2005.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385877","","Access control;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data security;Distributed computing;Hardware;Open source software;Operating systems;Permission","","","","4","1","19","","","03-06 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many intrusion detection models are proposed by the researchers and most of them are promising. How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage. We use a sample case study of disaster recovery operations system to have a real scenario of mobile ad-hoc practice. An experiment is conducted using that scenario under different treatments.

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile. We demonstrate that the proposed distributed approach achieves comparable accuracy compared to a centralized approach, while the communication overhead in the network and energy consumption is significantly reduced.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678106","","Heating;Wireless sensor networks","fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;communication overhead;distributed principal component analysis;fault diagnosis;fixed-width clustering;intrusion detection;wireless sensor networks","","1","","16","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network forensics is digital forensic in networked environments. However, the amount of network traffic is huge and might crash the traffic capture system if left unattended. Not all the information captured or recorded can be useful for analysis or evidence. The more the network traffic, the harder the network analyzing. Therefore, we need an effective and automated analyzing system for network forensics. We propose a fuzzy logic based expert system for network forensics that can analyze computer crimes in networked environments and make digital evidences automatically. This system can provide an analyzed information for forensic experts and reduce the time and cost of forensic analysis.","1098-7584;10987584","0-7803-8353-2;0780383532","","10.1109/FUZZY.2004.1375521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375521","","Art;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Costs;Digital forensics;Expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Telecommunication traffic","computer crime;expert systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy systems;information retrieval;telecommunication traffic","automated analyzing system;computer crimes;crime information retrieving;digital evidences;digital forensic science;expert system;forensic experts;fuzzy logic;network forensics;network traffic;traffic capture system","","0","","12","","","25-29 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination). We explore the security, cost, and accuracy of our protocol.","","0-7695-2375-7;0769523757","","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540983","","Costs;Directional antennas;Loss measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Protocols;Robustness;Security;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;data integrity;directive antennas;message authentication;mobile radio;monitoring;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","authenticity report;civilian application;data integrity;directional antenna;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring function;packet forwarding report;secure link layer acknowledgment;traffic forwarding activity;traffic measurement","","1","","20","","","17-21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This relatively predictable working flow make it easy to build accurate node profiles and detect any violation of normal profiles. In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When WSNs are deployed in inaccessible areas, the probability of occurring different types of attacks is very high. So the security of WSN becomes extremely important. As sensors have limited processing power, limited storage, low bandwidth, and energy; traditional security measures designed for the resource-rich networks such as LAN etc. are not suitable for the resource-constrained WSN. In presence of such limitations it becomes mandatory to devise lightweight security solutions for data transmission in WSNs. Because of problems in public key cryptography such as costly key computation, longer keys, key vulnerability to brute force attack, key distribution and maintenance, etc., it is not preferred for WSN. The less computation and low memory requirements of symmetric key cryptography with very short length of key (lightweight) justifies its use in WSN to achieve information security. Hence, this paper aims to study, discuss and analyze the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms Suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks.","","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507438","Authenticity;Availability;Confidentiality;Data Freshness;Integrity;Lightweight Cryptography","Communication system security;Cryptography;Monitoring;Schedules;Vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","data transmission;environmental conditions;lightweight cryptographic algorithms;lightweight cryptography;public key cryptography;resource constrained WSN;resource rich networks;small sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7;9781479981717","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there could be a issue of keys length, hence we can enforce the number of hops to be added for key generation after reaching threshold, then generation of keys starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the ongoing/flowing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a destination node, the source node will send a packet to a destination via a designated path. The target node and threshold node would be storing a expected key from all its neighbours, when a packet reaches to a target node or threshold node, key of packet and key of target node is compared, if a match is found, then accept the packet as valid one else discard it or deny the communication.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate).

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme.

MADAM has been designed to take into account those behaviors characteristics of almost every real malware which can be found in the wild. MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4799-3629-8;9781479936298","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","2","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge.

Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs.

To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries.

Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency. However, the effect of change of a cluster tends to change the route; thus degrades the performance. This paper presents a low-overhead clustering algorithm for the benefit of detecting intrusion rather than efficient routing. It also discusses the intrusion detection techniques with the help of this simplified clustering scheme.","","978-0-7803-9442-1;9780780394421","978-0-7803-9442-1;9780780394421","10.1109/SCONEST.2005.4382879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382879","Ad hoc networks;clustering scheme;election process;intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Collaboration;Communication effectiveness;Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;collaborative detection approach;emergency rescue services;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;overhead clustering algorithm;route efficiency;wireless networks","","2","","11","","","27-27 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows focus to be limited to selected subsets of the network traffic, for example what might be categorized (correctly or otherwise) as the unexpected or potentially malicious portion.

Using these metrics we have modeled the security culture of IT workers individuals from Saudi Arabia. We suggest these metrics can be used for modeling and comparing different security cultures to develop a global security culture required for effective global response to cyber security issues. We start by reviewing the latest research on the social aspects of information security. Then we highlight the history of the under-development social security metrics. Afterward we discuss the setup of the case study and the methodology used. Finally, we discuss the experiment results and suggested further research work.","","978-1-4673-5230-7;9781467352307","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516793","Risk Management;Security Controls;Security Culture;Security Mental Models;Social Security Metrics","","cultural aspects;security of data","IT workers;Saudi Arabia;cyber security issues;global response;global security culture;information security;security cultures;security modeling;social aspects;social metrics;under-development social security metrics","","0","","20","","","12-14 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The four phases of security [Feature: Security Planning]","P. Bouvier","Thales Security Systems","Information Professional","20091103","2005","2","1","20","25","Given the large number of information system security measures that exist, organisations find it more and more difficult to distinguish which measures should be granted priority in order to mitigate their information system risks. There are many questions. How do organisations know if the security measures present in their information systems are compatible? What are the steps that should be taken to increase the level of security? What can be done to better protect against incident or malicious activity? How can attacks, or incidents, be more easily discovered? What actions should be taken in the event of an attack? How can information systems be returned to normal operating activity following a disaster? To arrive at simple answers adapted to the context of the organisation, it is recommended that a rigorous approach be adopted. One can respond to these questions by developing a model. This information system security risk management cycle model assists organisations in differentiating among possible security measures to determine those that should be implemented.","1743-694X;1743694X","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5308743","","","","","","0","","","","","February-March 2005","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Traditional intrusion detection mechanisms have limited applicability to the sensor networks due to scarce battery and processing resources. Therefore, an effective scheme would require a power efficient and lightweight approach to identify malicious attacks. The goal of this paper is to evaluate sensor node attributes by measuring the perceived threat and its suitability to host local monitoring node (LMN) that acts as trusted proxy agent for the sink and capable of securely monitoring its neighbors. Security attributes in conjunction with genetic algorithm jointly optimizes the placement of monitoring nodes (i.e., LMN) by dynamically evaluating node fitness by profiling workloads patterns, packet statistics, utilization data, battery status, and quality-of-service compliance.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199399","","Battery charge measurement;Communication system security;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;USA Councils;Wireless sensor networks","communication complexity;genetic algorithms;mobile radio;quality of service;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","battery status;genetic algorithm;local monitoring node;malicious attack;network threat;packet statistics;quality-of-service compliance;reduced complexity intrusion detection;resource constrained multihop mobile sensor network;security attribute;trusted proxy agent;utilization data;workloads pattern","","3","","18","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090224","2008","","","1","5","An anonymous on demand routing protocol (ANODR) was designed based on the previous studies as the countermeasure for preventing passive attacks. ANODR is a purely on demand routing and identity free routing scheme that sets up an anonymous route as needed in real time. The proposed protocol ensures node privacy, route anonymity and location privacy and is robust against several known attacks. This limits the chances of eavesdropping and traffic analyzing to a time-critical on-demand window. Anonymity is one of the important characteristics in securing a wireless ad hoc network routing. In this paper we study the unique anonymity threats in wireless ad hoc environments. Two design principles of anonymous routing - anonymous route discovery and anonymous data forwarding are presented here. In the anonymous route discovery design, a random route pseudonym for an on demand route is established. In the anonymous data forwarding design, the source wraps its data packets for each end to end connection. This was implemented and tested using NS-2.0 simulator. The behavior of the proposed system has been studied for analysis like packet delivery ratio, packet delay and overhead along with the existing system.","","978-1-4244-3594-4;9781424435944","978-1-4244-3595-1;9781424435951","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787692","","Communication system security;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Privacy;Protection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","ANODR;NS-2.0 simulator;anomaly detection;anonymous data forwarding;anonymous on demand routing protocol;anonymous route discovery;black hole;route disrupt attacks;time-critical on-demand window;wireless ad hoc network routing","","0","","16","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
