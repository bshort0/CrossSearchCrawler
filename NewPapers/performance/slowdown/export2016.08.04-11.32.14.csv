As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-7837-8;9781424478378","978-0-7695-4158-7;9780769541587","10.1109/CICSyN.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615975","Cluster;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless ad hoc networks","","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;pattern clustering;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized monitoring points;cluster heads;clustered wireless ad hoc networks;co-operative algorithms;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;intermittent wireless communications;intrusion related message communication;mobile agents;network security;node clustering","","3","","15","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ad hoc network is at very early stage, but evolving fast. Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a kind of ad hoc network consists of mobile nodes connected through wireless technology. It is open, decentralized, low powered and dynamic in nature which makes it popular not only among the researchers but also among the attackers. The routing in MANET provides shorter path to reach destination, but that may not be the reliable one. So to make it reliable researchers have proposed various security mechanisms like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), secure routing protocols, firewalls etc. The Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) is one of the security schemes. In EAACK, the S-ACK mode successfully detects the malicious link in the network. But it declares both the nodes connecting or forming this link as malicious or misbehaving node. So to detect exact malicious node we are proposing an improved EAACK scheme. In proposed scheme we are making use of Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for improved security with reduced key size and with less computation.","","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7456941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456941","Ad hoc network;Digital Signature;EAACK;IDS;Improved EAACK;Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)","Mobile ad hoc networks;Receivers;Reliability;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","ECC;MANET;S-ACK mode;elliptic curve cryptography;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;improved EAACK scheme;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;secure routing protocols;wireless networks","","","","17","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","1","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have simulated in NS2 environment and shown the comparison of energy consumption or Residual energy of nodes having fixed transmission range with the proposed adaptive energy scheme. Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster.

Specifically, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to minimize the overhead of the self-healing process (e.g., the recovery latency), while considering the constraints of power system observability, hardware resources, and network topology. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to decrease the computational complexity.

Moreover, it can control the execution of operating system software through the hypervisor.

However, it is a challenging task due to the fact that a huge amount of data might be generated for being analyzed in very short time. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying complex analytics and modern in-memory database technology on the large amount of log data. Logs from different kinds of devices are collected, normalized, and stored in the In-Memory database. Machine learning approaches are then implemented to analyze the centralized big data to identify attacks and anomalies which are not easy to be detected from the individual log event.

In the same motif, organizations are establishing security and survivability frameworks as an integral part of their business strategy so as to provide an acceptable quality-of-service for their clients and employees. However, the current paradigm of outsourced managed security service providers (MSSPs) is often difficult to transition to, offers little control to the organization, does not allow ldquobest of breedrdquo composition, and risks vendor lock-in due to the complexity of migrating to a different MSSP. We present MOSES (Mediated Overlay Services), an architecture for composing network security services such as anti-spam, antivirus, automated vulnerability detection and mitigation, and filtering. MOSES is roughly modeled on the web services framework. In addition to ease-of-deployment, MOSES allows for economies of scale and a reduction to the total cost of ownership. In this paper, we discuss our motivation and high-level view of such an architecture. We highlight the advantages, illuminate potential drawbacks, and discuss a broad research agenda toward realizing this vision.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567338","","Application software;Availability;Costs;Data security;Economies of scale;Filtering;Management training;Outsourcing;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","Web services;information networks;security of data","Web services framework;antispam;antivirus;automated vulnerability detection;managed security service providers;mediated overlay services;network security;quality-of-service;total cost of ownership","","0","","19","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays.

To overcome these drawbacks, some researchers suggested to apply Peer-to-Peer approaches in intrusion detection. Most current Peer-to-Peer intrusion detection systems only allow hosts to collect related information from ""neighbours"" (one hop hosts). The limitation of information sources may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Agent Based Peer-to-Peer Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework. Agents are included in this framework to achieve intrusion detections. In addition, a mobile agent migration strategy is applied in the framework to allow agents not only to collect information from direct-linked ""neighbours"" but also other hosts in the network. Benefitted from agent and Peer-to-Peer techniques, our framework can decrease the overhead of each host in the network, reduce the security risk, and achieve more accurate detections.","","978-0-7695-3131-1;9780769531311","","10.1109/ICIS.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529830","","Australia;Computer hacking;Computer science;Distributed computing;Failure analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Software engineering","mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","P2P distributed intrusion detections;hierarchical intrusion detection systems;mobile agent migration strategy;peer-to-peer intrusion detection systems","","3","","10","","","14-16 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055;10952055","1-4244-0572-6;1424405726","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7;9781467306737","978-1-4673-0672-0;9781467306720","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure the security and reliability of a modernized power grid, the current deployment of millions of smart meters requires the development of innovative situational awareness solutions to prevent compromised devices from impacting the stability of the grid and the reliability of the energy distribution infrastructure. To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","978-1-4577-2005-5;9781457720055","978-0-7695-4590-5;9780769545905","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","39","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Symposium on","20090515","2009","","","163","170","Protecting and securing sensitive information are critical challenges for businesses. Deliberate and intended actions such as malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, are not only harmful and difficult to detect, but frequently these threats are propagated by an insider. Unfortunately, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information such as what is found in document control and management systems are limited in scope and capabilities. This paper presents an approach to detecting anomalies in business transactions and processes using a graph representation. In our graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) approach, anomalous instances of structural patterns are discovered in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. A definition of graph-based anomalies and a brief description of the GBAD algorithms are presented, followed by empirical results using a discrete-event simulation of real-world business transactions and processes.","","978-1-4244-2765-9;9781424427659","","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938645","","Communication system security;Companies;Computer science;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Pattern matching;Protection;Terrorism","authorisation;business data processing;data mining;graph theory;transaction processing","GBAD algorithm;business transaction process;data mining;graph-based anomaly detection;malicious exploitation;securing sensitive information;unauthorized access","","2","","18","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, PCA is performed in a centralized manner, which has poor scalability for large distributed systems, on account of the large network bandwidth cost required to gather the distributed state at a fusion center. Consequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA algorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without losing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48. However, accuracy for this hybrid technique is slightly lower compared to others.","","978-1-4577-2154-0;9781457721540","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122808","Intrusion detection system;accuracy;artificial immune recognition system;false alarm rate;rough set theory","Accuracy;Data mining;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","artificial immune systems;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;rough set theory","AIRS1 algorithm;AIS;DOS attack;IT department;J48 algorithm;NSL-KDD;Rough-AIRS 1;artificial immune recognition system;artificial immune system;denial of service attack;false alarm rate;flood attack;incremental learning approach;intrusion detection system;memory storage;redundant feature;rough set theory;security threat;software bug","","0","","15","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Marking-based traceback (MBT) has been considered a promising traceback approach, and has received considerable attention. However, we find that the traceback message delivery problem in MBT, which is important to the successful completion of a traceback, has not been adequately studied in the literature. To address this issue, we present the design, analysis, and evaluation of opportunistic piggyback marking (OPM) for IP traceback in this paper. The OPM distinguishes itself from the existing works by decoupling the traceback message content encoding and delivery functions in MBT, and efficiently achieves expedited and robust traceback message delivery by exploiting piggyback marking opportunities. Based on the proposed OPM scheme, we then present the flexible marking-based traceback framework, which is a novel design paradigm for IP traceback and has several favorable features for practical deployment of IP traceback. Through the numerical analysis and the comprehensive simulation evaluations, we demonstrate that our design effectively reduces the traceback completion delay and router processing overhead, and increases the message delivery ratio compared with other baseline approaches.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2491299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299300","IP Traceback;IP traceback;Marking-based Traceback;Network Forensics;Opportunistic Piggyback Marking;marking-based traceback;network forensics;opportunistic piggyback marking","Delays;Encoding;IP networks;Probabilistic logic;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security","IP traceback;MBT approach;OPM scheme;cyber attacks;marking-based traceback;network diagnosis;opportunistic piggyback marking;traceback message content encoding;traceback message delivery problem;user traffic diagnosis","","","","51","","2015-10-15","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Koral","The Interdisciplinary Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE","20120510","2012","","","1987","1995","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless image sensor networks, some monitoring quality loss may be tolerated since visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevance for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes. We simulated different communication scenarios to show the expected energy saving when the proposed solution is employed.","","978-1-4577-1724-6;9781457717246","","10.1109/SAS.2012.6166274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166274","Energy-Efficient Monitoring;Sensing Relevance;Wireless Image Sensor Networks","Energy consumption;Image sensors;Monitoring;Sensors;Visualization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;image sensors;wireless sensor networks","energy efficient;image snapshots;image transmissions;sensing relevancies;source nodes;visual monitoring;wireless image sensor networks","","2","","16","","","7-9 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.","1095-2055;10952055","0-7803-9428-3;0780394283","","10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866","","Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic","","3","","17","","","17-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of the SBAC is based on the observation that if the routers have information about the services that are running on the end host and can identify the upper layer traffic from the IP packet payload, then it becomes easy to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic for that particular victim server. To minimise the overhead on the routers, the SBAC model is invoked during the attack times only and the victimpsilas traffic is processed separately. The boundary routers in SBAC model validate each incoming packet to the victim on a per server basis. Only the packets that are considered to be accessing the legitimate services are passed and the remaining packets are dropped. Hence, at this stage the victimpsilas network is immune to any dynamic changes in attack pattern if the attack packets are not accessing the legitimate services at the victim end. The packets that are considered to be accessing legitimate services of the victim machine/network are marked with a unique ID and destined to the victim. If any of the received packets are found to be malicious, the unique ID enables the victim to identify service specific attack signature for each ingress SBAC router and prevent the attack traffic at that particular router. We will also discuss how the SBAC model deals with attacks on the infrastructure of the autonomous system.","","978-0-7695-3702-3;9780769537023","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090528","Access control;Autonomous System;Denial of Service;Traceback","Access control;Computer crime;Computer network management;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;authorisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attack;IP packet payload;Internet;SBAC router model;autonomous system;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate service;malicious attack traffic;service-based access control model","","4","","30","","","2-4 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead.

A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device.

An important step for the investigation or even prevention of these breaches is to normalize and analyze security-related log events from various systems in the target network. However, the number of log events produced in big IT landscapes can grow up to multiple billions per day. Current log management solutions, e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), cannot even closely normalize such huge amounts of data and therefore disable the tracking of attacks in real-time, which means that the log data remains unusable for attack analysis. In this paper, we present an approach to fully normalize event logs in high-speed by making use of established high-performance inter-thread messaging in conjunction with a hierarchical knowledge-base of log formats and parallel processing on multiple low-end systems. Using our approach, we are able to process more than 250,000 events/sec on relatively low-profile machines and can therefore easily handle more than 20 billion events/day, which is enough to handle average and peek loads of log events from big enterprise networks.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410270","event logs;inter-thread messaging;network security;normalization","Companies;Concrete;Instruction sets;Knowledge based systems;Parallel processing;Receivers;Security","parallel processing;security of data","IT landscapes;SIEM;big enterprise networks;distributed normalization;hierarchical knowledge-base;high-performance interthread messaging;instant attack analysis;log management solutions;low-profile machines;parallel normalization;parallel processing;real-time attack tracking;security breach prevention;security information and event management;security-related log event analysis","","","","18","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927;10636927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838227","","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Control systems;IP networks;Measurement;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","","","","30","","28","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach has been proposed, where the communication in a network works on set of random keys called KEY<sub>1</sub>=X+KEY<sub>0</sub>, KEY<sub>2</sub>=X+KEY<sub>1</sub>, KEY<sub>3</sub>=X+KEY<sub>2</sub>...KEY<sub>N</sub>=X+KEY<sub>N-1</sub> to establish the connection between devices and to validate the packets. Since the validation is based on the keys i.e, KEY<sub>1</sub>=X+KEY<sub>0</sub>, KEY<sub>2</sub>=X+KEY<sub>1</sub>, KEY<sub>3</sub>=X+KEY<sub>2</sub>...KEY<sub>N</sub>=X+KEY<sub>N-1</sub> which is delivered by the previous threshold/source node via an alternative path. This ensures that, there is a packet integrity. This technique can trigger a issue of keys length, therefore we can enforce the number of hops to be added for the key generation, after reaching a threshold limit, then keys generation starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the flowing/ongoing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a target node, the source node will send a packet to a target via a recognised path. The destination node and threshold node would be holding a expected key which is delivered from the alternative path, when a packet reaches to a destination/threshold node, the packet's key and key of target/threshold node is compared, if both keys are matched then accept the packet as genuine one else discard it or deny the communication. This MANET enforces two level of security validation, first one is, key checking at each threshold node, another is, ensuring key integrity via true node's path to validate the packet.","","978-1-4799-6437-6;9781479964376","","10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324085","AODV;Alternative path;DSR;Flowing-key;MANET;Random-Key;Threshold;X-Key","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Mobile computing;Routing;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;X-key;destination node;flowing-ongoing key;mobile ad hoc network;mobile devices;packet integrity;random keys;robust security;source node;target node;threshold based path oriented network;threshold node","","","","12","","","5-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157;07303157","978-0-7695-3726-9;9780769537269","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","1","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337;23479337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","1","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401","","Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols","digital storage;file organisation;security of data","IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems","","1","","16","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927;10636927","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Applications of Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams","T. Sasao; J. T. Butler","","Applications of Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams","20141217","2014","","","","","A zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZDD) is a data structure to represent objects that typically contain many zeros. Applications include combinatorial problems, such as graphs, circuits, faults, and data mining. This book consists of four chapters on the applications of ZDDs. The first chapter by Alan Mishchenko introduces the ZDD. It compares ZDDs to BDDs, showing why a more compact representation is usually achieved in a ZDD. The focus is on sets of subsets and on sum-of-products (SOP) expressions. Methods to generate all the prime implicants (PIs), and to generate irredundant SOPs are shown. A list of papers on the applications of ZDDs is also presented. In the appendix, ZDD procedures in the CUDD package are described. The second chapter by Tsutomu Sasao shows methods to generate PIs and irredundant SOPs using a divide and conquer method. This chapter helps the reader to understand the methods presented in the first chapter. The third chapter by Shin-Ichi Minato introduces the ""f ontier-based"" method that efficiently enumerates certain subsets of a graph. The final chapter by Shinobu Nagayama shows a method to match strings of characters. This is important in routers, for example, where one must match the address information of an internet packet to the proprer output port. It shows that ZDDs are more compact than BDDs in solving this important problem. Each chapter contains exercises, and the appendix contains their solutions.

Many of the sandboxing systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, a problem in existing sandboxing systems is the amount of overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a sandboxing system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a sandboxed application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application.

The proposed work contributes to the problem of securing data forwarding in the network layer; this is accomplished through exploiting the redundancy of multi-path routing for forwarding data packets. To maximise the possibility of successful delivery to a destination, each node generates a table with a reliability index for each of its neighbour without performing neighbourspsila monitoring; based on that reliability value, sending/receiving traffic is prioritised. This work evaluates the effectiveness of REliable and Efficient Forwarding (REEF) using the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA), REEF-IDA; the conducted simulation shows that REEF-IDA outperforms REEF in which it increases the throughput of the network while it decreases both end-to-end delays and packet loss ratio.","","978-9927-486-02-0;9789927486020","978-9927-486-03-7;9789927486037","10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669844","Ad hoc networks;cross layering;information dispersal;mobility;network layer;packet forwarding;priority queuing;security","Data security;Dispersion;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Redundancy;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data forwarding security;end-to-end delays;information dispersal algorithm;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;neighbour monitoring;packet forwarding enhancement;packet loss ratio;reliability index;reliable-efficient forwarding;security research field;sending-receiving traffic","","0","","31","","","8-10 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Most of existing approaches do not exploit direct and indirect observation at the same time to evaluate the trust of an observed node. The existing scheme has a very low throughput even if the number of malicious nodes is very small. In the proposed trust management scheme, the trust model has two techniques are trust from direct observation and trust from indirect observation. In direct observation, the trust value of observer node can be derived using Bayesian inference theory. Similarly the dempster-shafer functioned for neighbor node.

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart wireless devices in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), CR systems are vulnerable to numerous security threats that affect the overall performance. There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables. We also present recommendations that can be followed while implementing countermeasures to enhance CRN security. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of CRN security attacks and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this area.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2380998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985519","CR security;Cognitive radio (CR);game theory;software-defined radio;wireless security","Collaboration;Communication system security;Physical layer;Protocols;Security;Sensors;Wireless communication","cognitive radio;radio spectrum management;security of data","CR systems;CRN;cognitive radio networks;game theoretic approaches;licensed primary users;network protocol layers;scarce radio frequency spectrum;security threats;unlicensed secondary users;wireless devices","","9","","137","","2014-12-18","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Given the speed with which new technologies are introduced in the Web environment, system deployment life cycles have shrunk significantly-but so have system life spans. After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations. This case study describes the process our systems architecture team followed for designing and deploying the new architecture. I detail the component selection rationale, with implementation details where allowed. Ours is just one successful approach to deploying a. multisite, fully redundant Web-based system for a large organization; other reasonable and viable ways to build such a system also exist.","1089-7801;10897801","","","10.1109/MIC.2002.1036039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036039","","Added delay;Application software;Buildings;Computer architecture;Costs;Internet;Open source software;Programming;Service oriented architecture;Software systems","Internet;management of change;systems re-engineering","Web infrastructure;component selection;multisite fully redundant Web-based system;systems architecture","","0","1","8","","","Sep/Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Tronel","SUPELEC, Rennes, France","Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), 2009 Fourth International Conference on","20100217","2009","","","51","58","Anomaly based intrusion detection systems rely on the build of a normal behavior model. When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-4498-4;9781424444984","","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research introduced a parallel intrusion detection system based on GPGPU and Open Computing Language (OpenCL), that processes incoming packets concurrently, thus increasing system capacity in a high throughput environment. The experiment result shows that performance of GPU-based design is improved on the average of 58.73x against a single-thread central processing unit (CPU) implementation, and on the average of 13.53x against a multi-thread implementation.

"Malware Clearance for Secure Commitment of OS-Level Virtual Machines","Z. Shan; X. Wang; T. c. Chiueh","Stony Brook University, Stony Brook and Renmin University of China, Beijing","IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","20130307","2013","10","2","70","83","A virtual machine(VM) can be simply created upon use and disposed upon the completion of the tasks or the detection of error. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Also it strongly depends on the central intrusion detection system or firewall because signature as the prior-knowledge is normally built on that kind of systems.

To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high-level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time-consuming task that requires deep system-level expertise. In this paper, we present Seclius, an online security evaluation framework that translates low-level IDS alerts into a high-level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. Seclius significantly reduces human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism that administrators can use to define security requirements. Experiments on a process control network with real vulnerabilities and a multistep attack show that Seclius can accurately report system security with low performance overhead and support the time-constrained security decision-making process that is necessary for critical infrastructure.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547151","Intrusion detection systems;information flow-based analysis;system security metric","Databases;Measurement;Organizations;Probabilistic logic;Security;Web servers","security of data","IDS;IT systems;Seclius framework;critical infrastructure;high-level system security measure;information flow-based consequence-centric security metric;information systems;intrusion detection system;online security evaluation framework;time-constrained security decision-making process","","1","","","","2013-06-25","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most techniques involve software-based analysis which is too slow to support the tight timing constraints often imposed on embedded systems. We propose a hardware-based intrusion detection approach which does not alter the functional performance of the system. When using a real-time operating system, the executing process changes several times each second, requiring fast adaptation on the part of the intrusion detection mechanism. We present a technique to exploit the partial runtime reconfiguration feature present on many modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to adapt intrusion detection to a new process at each context switch. The use of runtime reconfiguration enables the flexibility of software-based approaches with the performance benefits of hardware-based approaches.","1063-6404;10636404","978-1-4673-3051-0;9781467330510","","10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378633","","Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Law;Monitoring;Registers;Runtime","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;invasive software;operating systems (computers)","FPGA;adaptable intrusion detection;anomalous malware behavior;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-based approaches;hardware-based intrusion detection approach;partial runtime reconfiguration;real-time operating system;software-based analysis;software-based approaches;timing constraints","","0","","21","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Scaling Regular Expression Matching Performance in Parallel Systems through Sampling Techniques","D. Ficara; G. Antichi; F. Vitucci; N. Bonelli; A. Di Pietro; S. Giordano; G. Procissi","Cisco Syst.

For this purpose, regular expressions are used, due to their high expressive power, and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are adopted to match them. Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-9266-4;9781424492664","978-1-4244-9267-1;9781424492671","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider a Wireless Image Sensor Network (WISN) with a scheduling of image sensor node's activity based on the application criticality level. Sentry nodes capable of detecting intrusions with a higher probability than others will alert neighbor nodes as well as activating cover sets member for image disambiguation or situation-awareness purposes. In order to optimize the performance of image transfer from multiple sensor nodes to the Sink we propose a 2-hop neighborhood information- based cover set selection to determine the most relevant cover sets. Then, in order to be consistent with our proposed approach, a multi-path extension of Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (called T-GPSR) wherein routing decisions are also based on 2-hop neighborhood information is proposed. Simulation results show that our proposal reduces packet losses, enabling fast packet delivery and higher visual quality of received images at the Sink.","2156-9711;21569711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686505","2-hop information;Image transmission;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);mission-critical;multipath routing;quality of service (QoS)","Image sensors;Mission critical systems;Relays;Routing;Surveillance;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","image sensors;quality of service;surveillance;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","2-hop neighborhood information;T-GPSR;WISN;application criticality level;cover set selection;disaster response;greedy perimeter stateless routing;image transfer;intrusion detection;mission-critical surveillance;multipath extension;node activity;packet delivery;quality of service;routing decisions;sensor nodes;sentry nodes;visual quality;wireless image sensor networks","","3","","33","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
