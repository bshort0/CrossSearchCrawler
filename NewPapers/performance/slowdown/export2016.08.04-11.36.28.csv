However, attack trends change very fast nowadays, making it impossible to keep up with manual signature engineering. This paper describes a novel concept for automatic signature generation based on efficient autonomous attack classification. Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1;9781424457861","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, MANET is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. One of the most popular MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to different attacks is ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network. The simulation results show that the backbone network is trustable, has dynamic behavior, and has good coverage.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116020","AODV;Backbone;MANET;Security","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;AODV security;MANET routing protocol;ad hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;mobile backbone network;node reliability;route discovery process;routing attacks;secure technique","","0","","22","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully. By PDA algorithm the neighbor nodes inform about the attacker by raising a global alarm and prevent an intruder from the malicious attacks in the network.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950037","PDA;detection;misbehaving node;packet dropping;prevention","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDA algorithm;PDA-misbehaving node detection;PDA-misbehaving node prevention;changing topology;cooperative node;intruder prevention;intrusion detection-prevention algorithm;low-cost mobile devices;malicious activity;malicious attack detection;malicious attack prevention;malicious attackers;malicious node;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;neighbor nodes;node cooperation;node distribution;noncooperative nodes;packet dropping detection algorithm;packet forwarding;route detection;wireless networking capabilities","","0","","10","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","15","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","33","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The reporting propagates from child to parent nodes until it reaches the root. A novel control message, distress propagation object (DPO), is devised to report the anomaly to the subsequent parents and ultimately the edge-router. The DPO message is integrated to routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). The system has configurable profile settings and it is able to learn and differentiate the nodes' normal and suspicious activities without a need for prior knowledge. It has different subsystems and operation phases at data link and network layers, which share a common repository in a node.

Traditionally, network processor applications have been optimized for a single static workload scenario, but recently several approaches for run-time adaptation have been proposed. Comparing these approaches and developing novel run-time support algorithms is difficult due to the multicore system-on-a-chip nature of network processors. In this paper, we present a model for network processors that can aid in evaluating different run-time support systems. The model considers workload characteristics of applications and network traffic. We use a queuing network abstraction to model different runtime systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of this model by comparing the performance of two existing workload adaptation algorithms.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579529","network processors;runtime management;workload partitioning and mapping","Application software;Concurrent computing;Multicore processing;Network servers;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Runtime;System-on-a-chip;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;performance evaluation;queueing theory;system-on-chip;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","multicore system-on-a-chip;network processors;network traffic;queuing network;run-time adaptation;runtime support","","0","3","32","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference.

We propose a partitioning approach to network security, analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size.

These Networks are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information therefore security is important in WSNs. Routing attacks can have devastating effect on wireless Sensor Network and present a major challenge when designing security mechanisms. Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack.

Research on cyber-security is moving from such isolated IDSs towards Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) in order to protect large-scale networks. In CIDSs, a number of IDS sensors work together for creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Our contribution in this paper is a novel distributed and scalable CIDS, called SkipMon. Our system supports, both, the idea of locality and privacy preserving communication by means of exchanging compact alert data. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for interconnecting sensors that experience similar traffic patterns. The experimental results suggest that our CIDS, with our technique of connecting monitoring nodes that experience similar traffic, is scalable and offers a good accuracy rate compared to a centralized system with full knowledge of the participating sensors' data.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410282","","Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Sensors","groupware;security of data","CIDS;SkipMon;cyber-security;locality-aware collaborative intrusion detection system;mandatory security mechanisms;privacy preserving communication","","","","29","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a randomization method to defend against these DoS attacks from the system-design perspective. We inject a certain degree of randomization into the Radio Resource Management (RRM) and Mobility Management (MM) procedure, so the parameters which are important to the attacks would be difficult to measure and the values measured would be much higher. Our simulation shows that the amount of signaling messages on the attack is decreased by 90% and the adverse impact to performance is just less than 10%.

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.","","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454499","Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network;eHealthcare","Computer crime;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network security;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet of things;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;data packet delivery ratio;denial of service attacks;wireless mesh network;wireless mesh routing protocol","","","","21","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol.

A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4;9781467327084","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these issue, we first study the host-based detection architecture to monitor and detect cyber attacks and then develop sampling techniques to balance the tradeoff between detection accuracy and bandwidth overhead. We also investigate the impact of host-based attack detection on MANET.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4673-1729-0;9781467317290","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415605","","Accuracy;Arrays;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;risk analysis;telecommunication security","MANET;computing environment;cyber attack monitoring;cyber attacks;effective sampling techniques;host-based attack detection;host-based detection architecture;host-based intrusion detection;infrastructureless network environment;network-centric operation;resilient protected communication;security risks;tactical mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication","","0","","14","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node.

The core of this architecture, a novel energy efficient, disruption tolerant, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol (EERD), provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of a MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4673-2433-5;9781467324335","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack). Still, under normal traffic its running-time is worse than classical AC implementations.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores. We also present a multicore prototype implementation of the monitoring system on an FPGA platform.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682721","FPGA;data plane attack;hardware monitor;multicore processor;network infrastructure;network security","Hardware;Internet;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Program processors;Security","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;grid computing;multiprocessing systems;telecommunication network routing","FPGA platform;computer networks;data plane attacks;denial-of-service attack;field programmable gate array;hardware monitoring resource sharing;hardware monitoring systems;multicore prototype;network data plane;network processors defense mechanism;network processors protection;packet forwarding operations;router control interface;router hardware;scalable hardware monitoring grid;scalable hardware monitors;single malformed UDP packet;vulnerable packet processing software","","0","","21","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it started with data centers and battery-operated mobile devices, it has recently branched to core network devices such as routers. However, this emerging need for low-power system design has not been studied for security systems, which are becoming increasingly important today. Toward this direction, we aim to reduce the power consumption of network-level intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are used to improve the secure operation of modern computer networks. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to low-power system design, such as frequency scaling, lead to a disproportionate increase in packet processing and queuing times. In this paper, we show that this increase has a negative impact on the detection latency and impedes a timely reaction. To address this issue, we present a low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS (LEoNIDS): an architecture that resolves the energy-latency tradeoff by providing both low power consumption and low detection latency at the same time. The key idea is to identify the packets that are more likely to carry an attack and give them higher priority so as to achieve low attack detection latency. Our results indicate that LEoNIDS consumes power comparable to a state-of-the-art low-power design, while, at the same time, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster attack detection.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2369958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977945","Energy-Efficient Systems;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion detection systems;Low Latency;Low-Power design;Multi-Core Packet Processing;Network Security;Performance;energy-efficient systems;low latency;low-power design;multi-core packet processing;network security;performance","Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Program processors;Security;Time-frequency analysis","computer network security;energy conservation;low-power electronics;power aware computing;power consumption","LEoNIDS;battery-operated mobile devices;core network devices;data centers;frequency scaling;low attack detection latency;low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS;low-latency and energy-efficient network-level intrusion detection system;low-power system design;modern computer networks;packet processing;power consumption;queuing times;routers;secure operation;security systems","","0","","30","","2014-12-05","Jan.-March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data.

Network security and privacy protection without a central manager will be challenging. Several security mechanisms and privacy protections will require the cooperation of several nodes to defend the network from malicious attacks. We particularly investigate when for each node it is cost-effective to freely participate in the security mechanism or protect its privacy depending if that node believes or trusts that all other nodes or at least a minimum number of other nodes will do the same. In this case, each node will be involved in a trust dilemma that we will model using the mathematical framework of game theory and evolutionary game theory.

As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for a Storage Area Network (SAN) is to provide data integrity and confidentiality. In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers. This allows our scheme to be scalable and be free from any single point of failure or attack.","","0-7695-1888-5;0769518885","","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183514","","Availability;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Power system security;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks;Web server","cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;network operating systems","SAN entities;cryptographic processing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;group key agreement;group key mechanisms;reliability;scalability;scalable data sharing;storage area networks;strong cryptographic techniques","","3","1","30","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Until now, only a few researchers considered the use of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to combat these threats against CRNs. In this article we describe a CRN based on IEEE wireless regional area network (WRAN) and describe some of the security threats against it. For the secondary users in the CRN to quickly detect whether they are being attacked, a simple yet effective IDS is then presented. Our proposal uses non-parametric cumulative sum (cusum) as the change point detection algorithm to discover the abnormal behavior due to attacks. Our proposed IDS adopts an anomaly detection approach and it profiles the CRN system parameters through a learning phase. So, our proposal is also able to detect new types of attacks. As an example, we present the case of detection of a jamming attack, which was not known to the IDS beforehand. The proposed IDS is evaluated through computer based simulations, and the simulation results clearly indicate the effectiveness of our proposal.","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/MNET.2013.6523809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523809","","Cognitive radio;Intrustion detection;Network security;Privacy;Security;Telecommunication network management;Wireless networks","cognitive radio;jamming;radio networks;radio spectrum management;security of data;wide area networks","CRN;CRN system parameter;IDS;IEEE wireless regional area network;WRAN;anomaly detection approach;cognitive radio network;combating attack;cusum;intrusion detection system;jamming attack;nonparametric cumulative sum;radio spectrum scarcity;security threat","","6","","11","","","May-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message. Using this information an attacker node can choose that low energy node deliberately and forward all traffic through that node. This leads to low energy node in a permanent sleep mode.

Traditionally intrusion detection has relied on two data sources: various log files which record user's activity, and network traffic which contains potential threats. This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs. An external monitoring facility then checks the behavior of the program against known good execution paths. These paths are specified either using a domain specific language and hand-written rules, or by running the software in a learning mode and capturing the normal behavior for later comparison.","","978-0-7695-3126-7;9780769531267","","10.1109/ISA.2008.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511526","instrumentation;intrusion detection;open-source","Automata;Computerized monitoring;DSL;Domain specific languages;Information security;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Operating systems;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","computer systems;data source;intrusion detection automata system;network traffic","","1","","17","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis.

This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs.
