However, current security mechanisms for WSN are able to satisfy confidentiality, integrity, and authentication properties using cipher algorithms, key management schemes, and so on, but they are not enough to meet above requirements. Therefore, we propose a framework of survivability model for WSN. Our model adopts software rejuvenation methodology, which is applicable in security field and also less expensive. We model and analyze each cluster of a hierarchical cluster based WSN as a stochastic process based on semi-Markov process (SMP) and discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). The model analysis indicates the feasibility of our approach.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625351","Discrete Time Markov Chain;Software Rejuvenation;Survivability;Wireless Sensor Network;semi-Markov Process","Air accidents;Authentication;Availability;Information security;Information systems;Numerical analysis;Public key cryptography;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Stochastic processes;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;workstation clusters","authentication;cipher algorithm;data integrity;discrete-time Markov chain;intrusion detection;key management scheme;security mechanism;semiMarkov process;software rejuvenation;stochastic process;survivability model;wireless sensor network","","14","1","29","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Psyco-Virt architecture includes a cluster of virtual machines, the monitored VMs, which run the OS and applications of interest, and a further VM, the introspection one. Several agents distributed across the monitored VMs execute network and host IDS tools to discover attempted intrusions/attacks on the monitored VMs. The introspection VM makes the detection tools trustworthy by running an introspector and a director to discover any attempt to maliciously modify the kernel, the agents and the IDSes hosted on a monitored VM. On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected. In such cases, a monitored VM can either be stopped or frozen and its current state saved in a file for a later, deeper inspection. After describing Psyco-Virt, we discuss some examples of agents and functions using introspection and present preliminary results and performance figures of a first prototype.","","0-7695-2876-7;0769528767","978-0-7695-2876-2;9780769528762","10.1109/IAS.2007.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299776","integrity;introspection;intrusion detection;network security;system;virtual machines","Buildings;Condition monitoring;Filters;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","security of data;virtual machines","Psyco-Virt architecture;data exchange;high assurance intrusion detection tool;network intrusion detection technologies;trustworthy intrusion detection;virtual machine introspection","","7","2","26","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7;9781424491537","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system.

However, due to the lack of a physical line of defense, the security in such a network is a big concern. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered as one of the most effective security mechanisms in WMN. Traditionally, IDS is operated on the monitor nodes that cooperatively identify and assess intrusions by analyzing their collected network data. Therefore, most IDS mechanisms need to choose a large number of monitor nodes for good rapidity and accuracy, which increases overhead and degrades network performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic cooperative monitor node selection scheme based on social network analysis to solve the above issue. In the scheme, we choose the monitor nodes according to their influence in the network, which is evaluated by the relationship among the nodes and the analysis of mutual information. Then, the nodes with similar information are divided into the same monitor area. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce network cost compared with the traditional node section schemes.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336433","Monitor node selection;cooperative;mutual information;social network analysis","Accuracy;Bridges;Monitoring;Mutual information;Security;Social network services;Topology","security of data;social networking (online);wireless mesh networks","IDS mechanisms;WMN;dynamic cooperative monitor node selection algorithm;intrusion detection system;social network analysis;wireless broadband connectivity;wireless mesh networks","","","","16","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a context of high traffic with heavy tailed characteristics, static rules for dispatching traffic slices among distributed sensors cause severe imbalance. Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4;0769529224","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters.

Conventional defenses for these attacks are not scalable, are slow to react or introduce an overhead to each routed packet. In this paper, we present FlowFence, a lightweight and fast denial of service detection and mitigation system for Software Defined Networking (SDN). The FlowFence architecture includes routers running daemons to monitor the average occupation of their interfaces to detect congestion conditions, and an SDN controller that coordinates bandwidth assignment of controlled links. The controller limits the flow transmission rate along a path to prevent users' starvation. The mitigation procedure of starvation state allocates an average bandwidth, while flows exceeding the mean are penalized. The penalization is proportional to the difference between the fair limit and the current bandwidth usage. A system prototype was implemented and evaluated in the Future Internet Testbed with Security (FITS). The results show that the proposal avoids users' starvation of network resources without adding much overhead in the network.","","","","10.1109/GIIS.2015.7347185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347185","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer crime;IP networks;Monitoring;Servers;Software","Internet;computer network security;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;FITS;FlowFence architecture;Future Internet Testbed with Security;SDN controller;attack detection;congestion conditions;coordinate bandwidth assignment;denial of service defense system;denial of service mitigation system;flow transmission rate;routers;software defined networking;starvation state mitigation procedure;traffic pattern;user network resource starvation","","","","19","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society","20030923","2003","","","53","59","We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","χ<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","30","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2136-3;0769521363","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","16","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network. The vulnerability assessment is carried out using ns-2 simulations in an IEEE 802.15.4 network and within the AODV context. Observations derived from the assessment contribute towards future directions that can drive new designs of intrusion recov- - ery protocols in WSNs.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4577-0680-6;9781457706806","978-1-4577-0678-3;9781457706783","10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983922","WSN security;advanced threat model;intrusion recovery;vulnerability assessment","Computer crime;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Switches;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;protocols;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","AODV context;IEEE 802.15.4 network;WSN;factory floor;healthcare;intrusion recovery countermeasure;ns-2 simulations;pervasive computing;protocols;smart homes;vulnerability assessment;wireless communication;wireless sensor networks","","1","","28","","","June 28 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are responsible for the management and monitoring of substations and field devices. In this paper, we investigate the use of SDN as an approach to assist in the modernization of SCADA systems. We discuss its possible benefits, such as simplified management of power system resources. Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components. The mechanism was implemented as an SDN-based application for SCADA systems that uses multipath routing, which relies on SDN features to frequently modify communication routes between SCADA devices. Further, we performed an experimental evaluation to verify the impact and performance of the mechanism in the SCADA network.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140289","","Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Routing;SCADA systems;Substations","SCADA systems;power system management;smart power grids;software defined networking;substations;telecommunication network routing","ICT;SCADA components;SCADA devices;SCADA network performance;SDN-based SCADA systems;communication flows;communication routes;electric system;electricity distribution;electricity transmission;field devices;information and communication technology;multipath routing;network applications;power grids;power system resources management;smart grids;software-defined networking;substations management;substations monitoring;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","31","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the advent of collaborative computing and data sharing, more and more new modes of interaction have evolved resulting in the need and use of distributed resources. Work within this community has led to the development of Grid technologies, which address precisely these problems. In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect. A recent survey ranked grid computing as sixth on priority lists for IT spending among industry professionals. With this much interest, security becomes necessary to provide authentication, authorization, resource protection, secure communication, data confidentiality, data integrity, trust policies management, user key and credential management, service protection, and network security. This paper provides an insight classification of the different mechanisms and methods of security in grid computing environment, and also discusses the solutions for each category and its limitation in order to define the real problems in grid computing security.

An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the brand range of advanced security services, we selected a service mix formed by a firewall and a network intrusion detection system for a feasibility study of their introduction in the future access and edge network.

To the best of our knowledge, effective countermeasures for potential reliability issues in the hardware implementations of this algorithm have not been presented to date. In proposing the error detection approach, our aim is to have acceptable complexity and performance overheads while maintaining high error coverage. In this regard, we present a low-complexity recomputing with rotated operands-based scheme which is a step-forward toward reducing the hardware overhead of the proposed error detection approach. Moreover, we perform injection-based fault simulations and show that the error coverage of close to 100% is derived. Furthermore, we have designed the proposed scheme and through ASIC analysis, it is shown that acceptable complexity and performance overheads are reached.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application. We also discuss tradeoffs that will need to be considered in further development of systems using this design.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","10.1145/1185347.1185365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579531","communications systems;networking;virtualization","Driver circuits;Hardware;Kernel;Linux;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Software","computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ASIC;Symerton project;XML processing;network processors;operating systems;packet processing complexity;proof-of-concept implementation;service provider networks;virtual machine","","0","11","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission.

Specifically, at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We then provide a numerical design procedure to determine the appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant.

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate mechanisms to exploit temporal locality in a networking application and choose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as a case study. An IDS like the popular Snort [4] operates by scanning packet payload for known attack strings. It first builds a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a database of attack strings, and traverses this FSM using bytes from the packet payload. So we propose a redundancy-aware FSM traversal that skips the processing of redundant bytes.

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection.

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls.

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Bandwidth;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Quality of service;Resource management;Security;Switches","","","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to build a framework that exposes tools and methods for a centralized processing of IEEE 802.11 frames. In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","8","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

However, it does not certificate a status of a server side security countermeasures, e.g., a configuration and operating condition of a firewall (FW), a virus detection system (VDS) and an intrusion detection system (IDS). When a client machine communicates the server that is vulnerable to the attack, the server may affect the critical damage to the client machine. In this paper, we propose a security key infrastructure (SKI) scheme that verifies the server side security countermeasures by linkage between an external and an internal audit. We consider requirements for designs of the SKI scheme, and implement communication modules between the server and the client machine. It is shown that the proposed SKI can achieve a quick response of the server and provide the certification of the security countermeasures to the client machine","","4-88552-216-1;4885522161","","10.1109/APSITT.2005.203683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593490","","Authentication;Certification;Communication system security;Data security;Electronic countermeasures;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Power system security;Safety;Ubiquitous computing","computer networks;network servers;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","SKI;authentication technology;client machine;intrusion detection system;public key infrastructure;security key infrastructure scheme;server audit certification;server authentication;server side security countermeasures;virus detection system","","0","2","8","","","10-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total three networks: passenger network (PN), crew network (CRN), and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism.

Increases in both the work per network packet and packet rate make it increasingly difficult for general-purpose processor based firewalls to maintain line rate. In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall. Measurements show our hybrid firewall able to maintain close to 2 Gb/sec line rate for all packet sizes, a significant improvement over the original firewall. We also include the hard won lessons learned while implementing the hybrid firewall.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675271","hybrid firewall;netfilter;network firewall;network processor;prototype;throughput","Acceleration;Computer networks;Computer security;Information filtering;Information filters;Linux;Local area networks;Permission;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;authorisation;microprocessor chips","Linux Netfilter firewall;general-purpose processor;network firewalls;network processor acceleration","","2","3","15","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","1","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In traffic monitoring, a new recognition paradigm is proposed in which it minimizes unnecessary recognition. Therefore, the purpose of traffic monitoring is two-folds; to reduce amount of data to be recognized and to avoid unnecessary recognition.

We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4;1595933344","","10.1145/1127777.1127803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","12","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging reduce the difference between this variant and the original program to a minimal repair. We describe the algorithm and report experimental results of its success on 16 programs totaling 1.25 M lines of C code and 120K lines of module code, spanning eight classes of defects, in 357 seconds, on average. We analyze the generated repairs qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate that the process efficiently produces evolved programs that repair the defect, are not fragile input memorizations, and do not lead to serious degradation in functionality.","0098-5589;00985589","","","10.1109/TSE.2011.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035728","Automatic programming;corrections;testing and debugging.","Automatic programming;Computer bugs;Debugging;Encoding;Maintenance engineering;Syntactics","formal specification;genetic algorithms;software maintenance","GenProg;automatic software repair;defects repair;formal specifications;genetic programming;legacy programs;program annotations;special coding practices","","41","","75","","2011-10-06","Jan.-Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7;9781479900787","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) with Packet Marking","H. S. Kim; H. K. Kim","Grad. Sch. of Inf. Security, Korea Univ., Seoul, South Korea","Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications Workshops (ISPAW), 2011 Ninth IEEE International Symposium on","20110714","2011","","","388","393","Internet crimes such as DDoS attack have seriously affected the businesses that have dependencies on computer networks such as the Internet. However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3;9781457705243","978-0-7695-4429-8;9780769544298","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
