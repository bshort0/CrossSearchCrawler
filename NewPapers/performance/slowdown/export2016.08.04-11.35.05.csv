In IDMTM, we employ two new concepts: ""Evidence Chain (EC)"" and ""Trust Fluctuation (TF)"" to accurately evaluate the trust value of a node in the network for judging whether it is malicious or not. Comparing with other Intrusion Detection System, IDMTM can greatly decrease the possibility of false-alarm with by efficiently utilizing the information collected from the local node and the neighboring nodes. Also, IDMTM can efficiently isolate internal malicious nodes from the networks and enhance the security without compromising the performance of the networks.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-0-7695-3095-6;9780769530956","","10.1109/AINA.2008.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4482812","Ad hoc;evidence;intrusion;trust","Ad hoc networks;Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Fluctuations;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","IDMTM;based on trust model;evidence chain;intrusion detection mechanism;mobile ad hoc networks;trust fluctuation","","5","","12","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, smart grid Systems are considered critical systems requiring reliable and real time data delivery and an efficient, flexible, scalable control solution to satisfy the system requirements. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a new architecture model for smart grid networks based on the Software Defined Systems (SDSys) paradigm. The main idea behind the SDSys revolves around abstracting the control plane out of the data plane and setting it at a separate layer in the middleware. Different forms of SDSys like Software Defined Network (SDN), Software Defined Storage (SDStore), Software Defined Security (SDSec) and Software Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT) are used to provide a comprehensive smart grid control solution which hide the complexity that exists in traditional control techniques. Meanwhile, we show how the proposed model can provide an accurate, reliable, secure, extensible and network-aware architecture design for smart grid network. Furthermore, we explain how it can provide a single point of view for all smart grid resources and a programmable interface to adapt the network for any sudden changes.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507269","","Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Internet of things;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Software","Internet of Things;middleware;power engineering computing;smart power grids;software defined networking","SDIoT;SDN;SDSec;SDStore;SDSys;middleware;smart grid networks;software defined Internet of Things;software defined based smart grid architecture;software defined security;software defined storage","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the past decades, these systems were isolated and use proprietary software, operating systems, and protocols. In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained. Cost - Benefit analysis is done for the various attack detection methods and the ROC curves are also plotted.","","978-1-4673-5037-2;9781467350372","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528514","Attack Detection;Classification;Cost-Benefit Analysis and ROC Curve;Intrusion Detection;Layered Approach","Accuracy;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","Bayes methods;cost-benefit analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;trees (mathematics)","CFS;DoS;IDS;J48;KStar;Naïve Bayes;Probe;R2L;ROC curves;RandomSubspace;RotationForest;U2R;correlation based feature selection;cost-benefit analysis;data near BalancedND;enhanced attack detection methods;feature selection;information assets;intrusion detection systems;layered approach;multiclass classifier;multiple learning based classifiers;ordinal class classifier;random forest;random tree;security infrastructure;security systems;system administrators","","1","","7","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attacks themselves are long-lasting, difficult to expose and often use very advanced hacking techniques. Since they are advanced in nature, prolonged and persistent, the organizations behind them have to possess a high level of knowledge, advanced tools and competent personnel to execute them. The attacks are usually preformed in several phases - reconnaissance, preparation, execution, gaining access, information gathering and connection maintenance. In each of the phases attacks can be detected with different probabilities. There are several ways to increase the level of security of an organization in order to counter these incidents. First and foremost, it is necessary to educate users and system administrators on different attack vectors and provide them with knowledge and protection so that the attacks are unsuccessful. Second, implement strict security policies. That includes access control and restrictions (to information or network), protecting information by encrypting it and installing latest security upgrades. Finally, it is possible to use software IDS tools to detect such anomalies (e.g. Snort, OSSEC, Sguil).","","","","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160480","","Command and control systems;Data mining;Malware;Monitoring;Organizations;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;data protection","access control;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection;attack vectors;computer systems;encryption;security policies;security upgrades;software IDS tools","","1","","14","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lucas","Telcordia Technologies","MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","20080222","2007","","","1","9","Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069","","Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks","","","","2","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider agents as associated to partial models of network normality that harmonize their conflicts via cooperative negotiation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising.","","978-0-7695-3496-1;9780769534961","","10.1109/WIIAT.2008.323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740680","cooperative negotiation;intrusion detection systems","Autonomous agents;Availability;Event detection;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Pressing;Prototypes;Robustness;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","cooperative negotiation;multiagent intrusion detection system;network normality;partial model","","1","","21","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

By arranging several sensors to deal with the traffic in parallel, the intrusion detection system's speed can be significantly increased. How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7;9781424437467","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the techniques that has been widely used for achieving such requirements is the employment of In-Memory Key-Value Storage (IMKVS) as caching mechanisms in order to improve overall user experience. Memcached and Redis are applications that use IMKVS approach. Commonly IMKVS clients use Consistent Hashing to decide where to store an object, which may cause network load imbalance. Furthermore, these clients work only at the application layer, so network conditions are not considered to distribute user's accesses. This paper proposes a new cache architecture with two phases load balancing to improve IMKVS performance, which has adopted a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture to manage the load balancing mechanism. The proposal was evaluated in the Mininet emulation environment and shows an improvement on load balancing giving best user experience.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405549","","Computers;Control systems;IP networks;Load management;Protocols;Servers","computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;social networking (online);software defined networking;virtualisation","Mininet emulation;NFV;SDN;data center;datacenter;in-memory key-value storages;network function virtualization;social networks;two-phase load balancing","","","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897;10636897","0-7695-2270-X;076952270X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","5","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our proposed scheme, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level intrusion detection is presented to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques. The network is divided to zones with one zone manager which is monitoring on cluster heads in its zone, but the most important problem is how can recognize the trustworthiness of zone manager which is done by “honest neighbors” of zone manager.

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2;9781457714542","978-0-7695-4521-9;9780769545219","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers.

The assessment is based upon experimental work that is conducted on a controlled environment. User-to-user network performance software is used to obtain the throughput, round trip time and tunneling overhead for TCP and UDP transmission protocol. The performance of TCP and UDP through 6 to 4 tunnel is then compared over the native IPv4 and IPv6 environment. As a result, the findings prove the ease of TCP data transmission via the tunnel compared to both native networks.

This vision can be accomplished by integrating the existing and emerging access networks via a common Internet Protocol (IP) based platform. Nevertheless, owing to the inter-worked infrastructure, a malicious security threat in such a heterogeneous network is no more confined to its originating network domain, but can easily be propagated to other access networks. To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network. The proposed framework incorporates two principal security components, in the form of anomaly detection framework and security control framework. Several plausible principles from two fields of biology, in particular the human immune system (HIS) and epidemiology have been adopted into the proposed security framework. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed biologically inspired security framework in detecting malicious anomalies such as denial-of-service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and worms, as well as restricting their propagations in the heterogeneous network.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2010.1012.0360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668982","Heterogeneous network security;biologically inspired security;danger theory;epidemiology;human immune system","Biological system modeling;Computer crime;Spectral analysis","complex networks;computer network security;invasive software;protocols","Internet protocol;biologically inspired anomaly detection;complex heterogeneous networks;denial-of-service;distributed DoS;future generation networks;human immune system;security control frameworks;worms","","4","","35","","","December 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions. The analysis also indicates that battery status awareness is crucial for BVs' secure operations for V2G networks in smart grid.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2224387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461499","Authentication;battery status;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Privacy;Smart grids;Vehicles","automobiles;battery powered vehicles;power engineering computing;smart power grids","BASA;BV;FC-to-discharging phase;V2G networks;battery state transitions;battery status-aware authentication scheme;battery vehicles;challenge-response authentication;data transmission;discharging-to-charging transition;information services;power grid;power services;privacy preservation;security protection;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid","","8","","26","","2013-02-13","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mobile agents are shown most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents or hosts. The CORBA has the best speed performance with lower overhead The Java-based RMI demonstrates the highest security based on the sandbox model.

Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. As the importance of MANET increases day to day, the vulnerability issues in MANET is important to be considered. The main issue concerned with MANET is partial dropping, ambiguous collisions, collusion.

This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

Our main goal is to support an extended view of the OpenFlow architecture by inspecting not only the packet header but also the payload information in the packets. For this purpose, we address a sophisticated packet forwarding scheme using DPI to inspect effectively all incoming packets. According to the results of our experiments, we choose the inside of a virtual switch as the most suitable position of the DPI module. In our scheme, there are a log server, a monitoring application, and DPI function for monitoring and managing network traffic. When the DPI module detects a predefined string pattern of bits in an incoming packet, the switch sends the matching information to the log server that stores logs that contain the detected pattern and resource usage. Then, the monitoring application periodically gathers log information on the log server to compare that information with predefined network policies. Finally, we show that the packets are dealt with in a more effective and efficient way in our sophisticated packet forwarding scheme.","","","","10.1109/ICSN.2016.7501921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501921","","Monitoring;Optical switches;Pattern matching;Protocols;Servers","packet switching;protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","DPI function;DPI module;OpenFlow architecture;OpenFlow protocol;OpenFlow switch;SDN controller;SDN infrastructure;deep packet inspection;log server;monitoring application;network administrators;network traffic management;network traffic monitoring;packet forwarding scheme;packet header;packet payload information;programmable network;resource usage;service chaining;software-defined networking;string pattern;virtual switch","","","","20","","","23-26 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem, called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection, the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs. However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom filters--which were originally designed for encoding binary membership information--are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter, we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2536618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431999","Computational efficiency;approximation algorithms;compression algorithms.","Arrays;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Memory management;Random access memory","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to their possible deployment in remote locations for civil, educational, scientific, military purposes and security which includes intrusion detection and intrusion prevention are of utmost importance. Distributed wireless sensor networks have problems on detecting and preventing malicious nodes which always bring destructive threats and compromise multiple sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Detection system is implemented based on learning automata concept.

The presented dynamical scheme is based on distribution of the algorithm on different hosts and making use of that the transactions has shared secrets by using the (k, n) secret-sharing threshold scheme. One of the positive outcomes of the current scheme is that it is distributed denial of service resistant system.

Although traditional detection methodologies employing signature and anomaly based systems have had reasonable success, new class of spyware programs emerge which blend in with user activities to avoid detection.

In this paper, as a first step, we address the deficiencies of static honeytoken generation and present an attack that circumvents such detection techniques. We synthesize the attack by means of data mining algorithms like associative rule mining. Next, we present a randomized honeytoken generation mechanism to address this new class of spyware.

Many of the new viruses seen today aren't advancements in their own right; rather, they have just taken advantage of advancements in technology. And the sophistication of infection techniques and vectors used by viruses these days are on the rise. With a recent increase in network file-infecting viruses, it's high time we revisit the traditional techniques used to detect virus-like activity on the network and improve them. This paper proposes using virtual area networks (VLANs) technology to mass deploy a SAMBA based honeypot to the entire site.

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","1","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure. In this article, we survey the up-to-date secure routing schemes. that appeared over the last few years.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper focuses on the special case where video is protected by Forward Error Correction mechanisms, which allow reordering of the original packet sequence after it may have been altered by network impairments.

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","978-1-4673-8314-1;9781467383141","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature. It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node.

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect malicious nodes.

Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count. The flow rate pattern of the spoofed flows is modeled at the attacker side using inter departure time and packet size.

A generic agent component is customized for each source system to produce events and allow JDL level 0 integration. Three different analysis components collect the events and produce meaningful objects, current state and future impact estimations in accordance with JDL levels 1 to 3. Brokered architecture allows level 4 control from various components, and JDL level 5 user interface is offered through a Web application. A prototype system has been developed to test and evaluate the SACIN framework.

The use of watchdogs is a well-known mechanism to detect selfish nodes. In this paper we propose a collaborative watchdog approach, which is based on the fast diffusion of selfish nodes awareness. Then, we introduce an analytical model to evaluate the time of detection and the overhead (number of messages) of our collaborative watchdog approach. The results show that a collaborative watchdog is a very efficient approach since the detection time of selfish nodes is reduced, and the overall overhead is very low.","2165-8528;21658528","978-1-4673-1377-3;9781467313773","978-1-4673-1376-6;9781467313766","10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261666","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Transient analysis;Wireless communication","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;collaborative watchdog approach;mobile ad-hoc networks;network cooperation schemes;selfish nodes;selfish nodes detection time","","0","","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This king of attacks are flooding access amount of unnecessary packets in network by that the network bandwidth are consumed by that data delivery in network are affected. Our main aim is visualized the effect of DDoS attack in network and identify the node or nodes that are affected the network performance. The profile based security scheme are check the profile of each node in network and only the attacker is one of the node that flooded the unnecessary packets in network then PPS has block the performance of attacker. The performance of network is measured on the basis of performance metrics like routing load, throughput etc. The simulation results are represents the same performance in case of normal routing and in case of PPS scheme, it means that the PPS scheme is effective and showing 0% infection in presence of attacker.","","978-1-4799-3069-2;9781479930692","","10.1109/CSNT.2014.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821368","Challenges;DDoS Attacks;Defensive mechanisms;PPS;Security Goal;Wireless Sensor Network","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PPS scheme;PPS security;WSN;flooding access;network bandwidth;normal routing;performance metrics;profile based protection scheme;routing load;unnecessary packets;wireless sensor networks","","0","","15","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and (4) resists collusion.","2155-5486;21555486","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks","","3","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, ""ICMP traceback (iTrace)"" is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for ""useful"" and ""valuable"" iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called ""intention-driven"" iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886;21604886","978-1-4673-1429-9;9781467314299","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","4","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To date, however, no published work has evaluated identity-only obfuscation approaches against using IPsec ESP tunnels as a way of hiding endpoint identities. The question is, are there some network configurations where identity-only obfuscation techniques work better than IPsec ESP tunnels?

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application. In the case of a civil application for ocean monitoring, the proposed technique is used to identify the minimum number of nodes required and their positions for effective communication.","","978-1-4799-8299-8;9781479982998","","10.1109/UT.2015.7108229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108229","deployment strategy;genetic algorithm;modeling;simulation;underwater acoustic sensor network","Genetic algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Three-dimensional displays","genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;pH;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","HVA;UWSN;computational intelligence techniques;energy constraints;genetic algorithm;high-value asset;ocean monitoring;physical network layout;sensor nodes;transmission frequency;underwater acoustic sensor networks;underwater sensor network positioning;wireless operation","","1","","21","","","23-25 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many algorithms and architectures have been designed to accelerate pattern matching, but most of them can be used only for strings or a small set of regular expressions. We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions. Moreover, a sparse transition table is mapped to memory with overlapped rows, which enables to store the table in a highly compact form.","","978-1-4244-6612-2;9781424466122","","10.1109/DDECS.2010.5491816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491816","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching","FPGA;NFA-Split architecture;deterministic automaton;fast regular expression matching;flip flops;intrusion detection systems;look-up tables;malicious attacks;network attacks;nondeterministic automaton transition table;pattern matching;sparse transition table;viruses","","3","","21","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An adaptive network intrusion detection approach for the cloud environment","H. H. Chou; S. D. Wang","Dept. of Electr. Eng., Nat. Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Security Technology (ICCST), 2015 International Carnahan Conference on","20160125","2015","","","1","6","As Internet attacks grow rapidly, firewalls or network intrusion systems are indispensable. Existing approaches usually use attack signatures, machine learning or data mining algorithms to detect and stop anomaly or malicious flow. Machine learning algorithms need a set of labeled data to train the detection model, while the labeled data set is not always available. In this paper, we proposed an anomaly detection approach that is adaptive to the ever-changing network environment. The approach constructs a decision tree-based detection model for intrusion detection from unlabeled data by using an unsupervised learning algorithm called spectral clustering. And the system can easily be deployed on the cloud environment. In the experiments with the DARPA 2000 data set and the KDD Cup 1999 data set, our system shows notable improvement on the detection performance after the adaptation procedure.","","978-1-4799-8690-3;9781479986903","","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389649","Cloud Computing;Decision Tree;Intrusion Detection System;Spectral Clustering","Adaptation models;Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Decision trees;Detectors","cloud computing;decision trees;pattern clustering;security of data;unsupervised learning","DARPA 2000 data set;Internet attacks;KDD Cup 1999 data set;adaptive network intrusion detection approach;anomaly detection;attack signatures;cloud environment;data mining algorithms;decision tree-based detection model;firewalls;machine learning algorithms;malicious flow;network intrusion systems;spectral clustering;unlabeled data;unsupervised learning algorithm","","","","33","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
