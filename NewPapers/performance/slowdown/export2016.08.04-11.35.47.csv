To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The inherent lack of security measures in the ADS-B protocol has long been a topic in both the aviation circles and in the academic community. Due to recently published proof-of-concept attacks, the topic is becoming ever more pressing, particularly with the deadline for mandatory implementation in most airspaces fast approaching. This survey first summarizes the attacks and problems that have been reported in relation to ADS-B security. Thereafter, it surveys both the theoretical and practical efforts that have been previously conducted concerning these issues, including possible countermeasures. In addition, the survey seeks to go beyond the current state of the art and gives a detailed assessment of security measures that have been developed more generally for related wireless networks such as sensor networks and vehicular ad hoc networks, including a taxonomy of all considered approaches.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2365951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940209","ADS-B;NextGen;air traffic control;air traffic management;aviation;broadcast;security;wireless","Aircraft;Jamming;Protocols;Radar;Security;Surveillance;Wireless communication","air traffic control;broadcasting;protocols","ADS-B protocol;ADS-B security;air traffic control;automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast protocol security;communication protocol;next-generation air transportation systems;sensor networks;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless networks","","3","","118","","2014-10-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time. The paper also makes an analysis of the features used to classify data in order to define which of them are really relevant for each class of attack defined in our experiments.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546735","Artifitial Neural Network;Internet Security;Intrusion Detection System;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Support vector machines;Training","","","","11","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20070723","2007","","","1","8","In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, ""security by obscurity"" has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer. This paper focuses on IEC TC57 WG15 security standards work which is addressing the reliability and security of the information infrastructure.","1932-5517;19325517","1-4244-1296-X;142441296X","1-4244-1298-6;1424412986","10.1109/PES.2007.386013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275779","DNP;ICCP;IEC;IEC 60870-5;IEC 61850;Security;communications;information infrastructure;power system operations;reliability","Communication system security;Energy management;Information security;Power system control;Power system management;Power system measurements;Power system reliability;Power system security;Power systems;Protocols","power markets;power system control;power system economics;power system management;power system reliability;power system security","IEC TC57 WG15 security standards;communication protocols;electricity market;information infrastructure security;power industry;power system control;power system equipment malfunctions;power system management;power system monitoring;power system reliability;reliability enhancement","","19","","","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we have made a survey on different techniques to prevent SQLi and XSS attacks and we proposed a solution to detect and prevent against the malicious attacks over the developer's Web Application written in programming languages like PHP, ASP.NET and JSP also we have created an API (Application Programming Interface) in native language through which transactions and interactions are sent to IDS Server through Inter Server Communication Mechanism. This IDS Server which is developed from PHPIDS, a purely PHP based intrusion detection system and has a system architecture meant only for PHP application detects and prevents attacks like SQLi (SQL Injection) and XSS(Cross-site scripting), LFI(Local File Inclusion), and RFE(Remote File Execution) and returns back the result to the Web Application and logs the intrusions. In addition to this behavioural pattern of Web Logs is analysed using WAPT algorithm (Web Access Pattern Tree), which helps in recording the activity of the web application and examines any suspicious behaviour, uncommon patterns of behaviour over a period of time, and it also monitors the increased activity and known attack variants. Based on this an report is generated dynamically using P-Chart which can help the Website owner to increase the security measu- - res, and also used to improve the quality of the Web Application.","","978-1-4577-0588-5;9781457705885","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972284","API;Intrusion Log;PHPIDS;SQLi;WAPT;XSS","Algorithm design and analysis;Application programming interfaces;Arrays;Databases;Monitoring;Security;Servers","Internet;SQL;Web sites;application program interfaces;authoring languages;computer crime;software architecture","API;ASP.NET;IDS server;JSP;LFI;P-Chart;PHP;RFE;SQL Injection;SQL injection attacks;SQLi attacks;WAPT algorithm;Web Logs;Web access pattern tree;Web application attack mechanisms;Web site;XSS attacks;application programming interface;backend database;craft credible phishing sites;cross platform intrusion detection system;cross-site scripting;cross-site scripting techniques;inter server communication technique;intrusion detection system;local file inclusion;malicious attacks;programming languages;remote file execution;system architecture","","4","","14","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regular expressions are one method to implement such matching and are often built in FPGAs using non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). To obtain high throughputs it is necessary to process many bytes in parallel. This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA. Throughputs over 40Gbps are achieved on smaller rule-sets.

A protocol can be compared to a language definition: it contains a vocabulary, syntax definition and semantics. Like any computer language the protocol language must be unambiguous. The protocol specifies the behavior of concurrently executing processes. This concurrency creates a new class of subtle issues. One technique to address these issues is the finite state machine (FSM). SigSec captures the signaling protocol messages and forwards them to the appropriate protocol analyzer in addition to saving them to a database. SigSec performs intrusion detection through multiple layers of checks and verifications. SigSec detects many known attacks that may pass through semantic and syntax analyzers.

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, an increased accuracy is needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to find optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a reasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization service, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the infrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an adaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical location estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about solving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models. We demonstrate the usability of our approach in a real-world environment and analyse Geolocation for the first time in Europe.

However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097;15219097","978-1-4577-1875-5;9781457718755","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%","2329-6267;23296267","1-4244-0700-1;1424407001","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103","","Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN","GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless","","0","","16","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Adaptive and Channel-Aware Detection of Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks","J. Ren; Y. Zhang; K. Zhang; X.

Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of the network.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2526601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401098","Wireless sensor network;channel-aware;packet dropping;reputation system;routing;selective forwarding attack;wireless sensor network","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Packet loss;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CRS-A;WSN;adaptive aware detection;adaptive detection threshold;attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme;channel aware detection;forwarding packets;information integrity;monitored packet loss;selective forwarding attacks;sensor nodes;time-varied channel condition;wireless channel;wireless sensor networks","","","","35","","2016-02-08","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic. We demonstrate through several examples, how our approach can dynamically detect attacks, quantify their impact, and how to reduce the impacts and recover from them.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514527","Abnormality distance (AD);network attack;proactive defense;quality-of-protection (QoP)","Computer crime;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;Internet;authorisation;fault diagnosis;monitoring;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AD metric;Internet infrastructure;QoP;QoS protocol;abnormality distance;automatic technique;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;network fault;network traffic flow;online monitoring;proactive defense network;quality-of-protection;quality-of-service;routing protocol;self-protection mechanism","","8","1","59","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform.

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6;9781424474226","978-1-4244-7421-9;9781424474219","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","2330-9881;23309881","978-1-4577-1481-8;9781457714818","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls.

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network.

We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN. Our analysis shows that, the proposed scheme could work well in conjunction with other security mechanisms for sensor networks and is very effective to resist any adversary's attempt to be included in a legitimate group in the network.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455133","Group;One Way Accumulator;Security;Sensor","Computer networks;Data security;Electronic mail;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Object detection;Open wireless architecture;Surveillance;Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these algorithms are computationally sophisticated, some hardware accelerators are needed to support high throughput. In this paper we propose an IPsec-based secure call admission control (SCAC) with multiple cryptographic accelerators. Our proposed IPsec-based Multifence Secure Call Admission Control in heterogeneous networks enhanced with Malicious Packets Filter (MPF), is a set of technologies and solutions. It enforces security policy and bandwidth compliance on all devices seeking to access network computing resources, in order to limit damage from emerging security threats and to allow network access only to compliant and trusted endpoint devices.

However, extending vehicular networks to include IP connections is still problematic, due in part to the incompatibility of mobile IP handovers with the increased mobility of vehicles. The handover process, consisting of discovery, registration, and packet forwarding, has a large overhead and disrupts connectivity. With increased handover frequency and smaller access point dwell times in vehicular networks, the handover causes a large degradation in performance. This paper proposes a predictive handover protocol, using a combination of a Kalman filter and an online hidden Markov model, to minimize the effects of prediction errors and to capitalize on advanced handover registration. Extensive simulated experiments were carried out in NS-2 to study the performance of the proposed protocol within a variety of traffic and network topology scenarios.

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","2","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT. Carried out experiments showed that our proposed system presents better performance as well as a good scalability compared to the pioneer known centralized IDS SNORT system over real traffic and a set of simulated attacks.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732386","Intrusion detection system;Misuse detection;Mobiles agents;SNORT rules","Computers;Databases;Focusing;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Monitoring","","","","0","","17","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown.

In this paper, we take a first step in designing connectivity maintenance protocols for more realistic communication models. We propose a distributed connectivity maintenance protocol that explicitly accounts for the probabilistic nature of communication links and achieves a given target communication quality between nodes. Our protocol is simple to implement, and we demonstrate its robustness against random node failures, inaccuracy of node locations, and imperfect time synchronization of nodes using extensive simulations.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold.

This problem arises in various fields, such as computational biology and network security. But the problem is not extensively studied as the single pattern case and there is no efficient algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub>σ</sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg σ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈Ig |p<sub>i</sub>|⌉ bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log σ + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text. The algorithm uses the words with X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈lg |p<sub>i</sub>| bits. We also demonstrate an FFT implementation based on the modular arithmetic for machines with word size of 64 bits. Finally, we show that both algorithms can be easily parallelized and the parallelized algorithms are given as well.","2168-3034;21683034","978-1-4244-9482-8;9781424494828","","10.1109/PAAP.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715080","Algorithm;FFT;Multi-pattern matching;Wildcards","Arrays;Computer science;Convolution;Electronic mail;Hamming distance;Pattern matching;Program processors","Hamming codes;fast Fourier transforms;set theory;string matching;text analysis","Hamming distance;fast Fourier transform;pattern matching;set of pattern;wildcard","","0","","13","","","18-20 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments.

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server. By correlating different streams of events, it is possible to achieve more effective detection of Web-based attacks.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254308","","Application software;Computer hacking;Computer science;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Web sites;computer crime;file servers","Web-based applications;Web-based attacks;WebSTAT intrusion detection system;World-Wide Web servers;operating system-level audit data;server host;sophisticated attack languages","","26","2","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Center, Herzliya, Israel","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20140417","2014","22","2","415","428","A central component in all contemporary intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is their pattern matching algorithms, which are often based on constructing and traversing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that represents the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on","20020806","2001","","","99","108","Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance.

Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions.

One cannot eliminate missing values in medical records. The reason may be because some tests may not been conducted as they are cost effective, values missed when conducting clinical trials, values may not have been recorded to name some of the reasons. Data mining researchers have been proposing various approaches to find and impute missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation approach for fixing missing values. The approach is based on clustering concept and aims at dimensionality reduction of the records. This serves the need to use the same records of lower dimension to be used for clustering and classification of medical records to arrive at accurate decision prediction. The case study discussed shows that the missing values can be fixed and imputed efficiently by achieving dimensionality reduction.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","5","","7","","2013-06-06","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Harnessing the Power of P2P Systems for Fast Attack Signature Validation","S. Antonatos; V. Q. Hieu","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Found. for Res. & Technol.

Third International Conference on","20091110","2009","","","107","114","Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching.

Our approach requires no user interaction, and no modification of or access to, either the backend database or the source code of the web application itself.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","13","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.","","978-1-4673-8050-8;9781467380508","","10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325234","DDoS Attacks;Flow Base IP Traceback;Network Security;Probabilistic Flow Marking","Computer crime;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Network interfaces;Probabilistic logic","Internet;computer network security","CAIDA archives;IP traceback scheme;IP traceback schemes;Internet;NAT;PFM;anonymous flooding attacks;distributed-denial-of-service attacks;network address translation;probabilistic flow marking;proxy device;security issues;source IP address spoofing;spoofed source IP addresses","","","","20","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

Therefore in this paper, in order to cope with this challenging concern, we have proposed a lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code. The primary focus is on making the algorithm lightweight so that on using it in achieving secured communication in energy starved networks like WSNs, the resource constrained nodes can successfully run the algorithm. Detailed security analysis shows that LMAC also thwarts passive attack as well as active attack. Finally the comparative usability of the MAC in the said application domain is worked out and that shows the dominance of LMAC over several state-of-the-art MACs. We claim that on an average LMAC requires 61% less overhead compared to its competitors.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417118","","Algorithm design and analysis;Authentication;Computers;Cryptography;Message authentication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","LMAC;WSN;lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code;wireless sensor network","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A survey on oblivious comparison of firewall policies in VPN","K. Sivanandham; O. S.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN Tunnel. To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of Guard is to first convert a firewall policy to non-overlapping numerical rules and then uses Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. After then datas were transferred from vpn server to home network.","","978-1-4673-0213-5;9781467302135","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215614","Network Security;Privacy;Virtual Private Networks","Artificial neural networks;Fires;Security;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;home networks;protocols;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","VGuard;VPN server;VPN technology;VPN tunnel;Xhash protocol;advance oblivious comparison;client;encrypted tunnel;firewall policy;home network;remote network;roaming user;security threat;traffic;virtual private network","","0","","10","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
