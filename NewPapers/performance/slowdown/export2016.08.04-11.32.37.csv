To improve the detection of attacks, sharing data among distributed nodes or terminals and collaborating on a decision is key. This paper presents a distributed and collaborative intrusion detection (DaCID) system that relies on Dempster Shafer theory of evidence for fusing data from multiple nodes. In this approach the detection is done collaboratively and the decision is distributed among all nodes. DaCID is more robust than other systems since it is completely distributed and the decision is made autonomously at each node. Simulation results demonstrated that DaCID's performance approaches that of a centralized method.","","978-1-4244-1772-8;9781424417728","978-1-4244-1754-4;9781424417544","10.1109/LCW.2008.4545399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545399","Collaborative;Dempster Shafer;Denial of Service;Distributed;Intrusion detection","Cats;Collaboration;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Distributed computing;Floods;Intrusion detection;Robustness","case-based reasoning;computer networks;groupware;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","Dempster Shafer evidence theory;collaborative intrusion detection systems;data fusion;data sharing;distributed intrusion detection systems;network security","","2","","17","","","31-31 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, many attempts have been made to study the intrinsic attributes of these insider attacks but the focus has generally been on the analysis of one or very few particular attacks, or only the survey of various attacks without any performance analysis. Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","8","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To run our algorithm, the network is divided into clusters and three types of nodes called header, monitor and general node are defined in each cluster. Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Self-securing storage addresses client and user account problems by transparently auditing accesses and versioning data within each storage server.

This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and 4) resists collusion.","","1-4244-1315-X;142441315X","1-4244-1316-8;1424413168","10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","","","","0","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization.

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2418434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090949","Data mining;insider attack;intrusion detection and protection;system call (SC);users' behaviors","Computers;Data mining;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-04-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm.

Intrusions using security breaches to achieve unauthorized access or misuse of critical information can have catastrophic consequences. To protect computer hosts from the increasing threat of intrusion, various kinds of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed. The main disadvantages of current IDSs are a high false detection rate and the lack of post-intrusion decision support capability. To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine. Alert fusion and verification models are implemented to provide more reasonable intrusion information from incomplete, inconsistent or imprecise alerts acquired by SVO monitors.

Increased uncertainty and complexity will increase the costs of malicious probing and attack efforts and thus prevent or limit network intrusion. As MTD increases complexity of the system for the attacker, the MTD also increases complexity in the desired operation of the system. This introduced complexity results in more difficult network troubleshooting and can cause network degradation or longer network outages. In this research paper the authors describe the defensive work factor concept. Defensive work factors considers in detail the specific impact that the MTD approach has on computing resources and network resources. Measuring impacts on system performance along with identifying how network services (e.g., DHCP, DNS, in-place security mechanisms) are affected by the MTD approach are presented.

Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks will co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN.

DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It may not work well in large-scale social networks since the number of users is extremely large and the difference between normal users and malicious users is inconspicuous. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: full information and partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem. We perform extensive simulations to validate the analysis and demonstrate the impact of system factors on the overall cost.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2560518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462258","crowdsourcing;largescale networks.;malicious users detection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Incentive schemes;Internet of things;Optimization;Sensors;Social network services","","","","","","","","2016-04-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network.

Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated. The advantage of this system is that it blocks intrusions in a manner transparent to the attacker and allows for observation and investigation of attacks in order to enable the administrator to take appropriate action.

In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers.

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate.

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","0191-2216;01912216","978-1-4799-7746-8;9781479977468","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised.

A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy.

Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection.

An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated.

The basic idea is to build micro firewalls on all hosts in the intranet, as a second line of defense behind the gateway firewall. A distributed intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed to achieve proactive intrusion responses with dynamic policy changes. Mobile agents, CORBA, and RMI are evaluated for dynamic policy update. We find that mobile agents are most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents and hosts. CORBA has the best speed performance. The Java-based RMI has the highest security based on the sandbox model.

In this paper, a pipelined parallel approach for hardware implementation of Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm for multiple strings matching called P2-AC is presented. P2-AC organizes the transition rules in multiple stages and processes in pipeline manner, which significantly simplifies the DFA state transition graph into a character tree that only contains forwarding edges. In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle. The memory cost is less than 47% of the best known AC-based methods. P2-AC supports incremental update and scales well with the increasing number of strings. By employing two-port SRAMs, the throughput of P2-AC is doubled with little control overhead.","1521-9097;15219097","978-0-7695-3434-3;9780769534343","","10.1109/ICPADS.2008.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724378","deterministic finite automata;network intrusion detection;parallel SRAMs;pipelined processing;string matching","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Pipelines;Real time systems;Tree graphs","SRAM chips;computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;parallel algorithms;pipeline processing;string matching;trees (mathematics)","character tree;deterministic finite automata state transition rule graph;hardware implementation;memory-efficient solution;multistring matching algorithm;parallel two-port SRAM;pipelined parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm;real-time packet processing","","4","3","19","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2;9781424490042","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research has to move in the direction of preserving and guarding network environments which today are facing an ever increasing number of security threats in the form of Trojan worm attacks and viruses that can damage the Computer systems and communication channel. Firewalls are used as a security check point in a network environment; nevertheless there are still various types of security issues which are on the rise. In order to strengthen the network from illegal access the concept of IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is gaining popularity around the world. The applications of the data mining in the computer security field improves the development of IDS in order to work on these applications it is essential to classify the degree of attacks in IDS and use it through data mining. Despite the use of IDS we cannot be completely certain about its workability and results of IDS use have been uncertain. To plug the loopholes we need to adjust the detection strategy according to the degree of attack activities to ensure error free results.","","","978-1-84919-868-4;9781849198684","10.1049/cp.2013.2486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851533","Data Mining;Firewall;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Threat","","computer viruses;data mining;firewalls;telecommunication channels","IDS;Trojan worm attacks;communication channel;computer security field;computer systems;data mining;firewalls;guarding network environments;illegal access;intrusion detection system;network security;preserving network environments;security threats;viruses","","1","","","","","27-28 Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

However, every intrusion detection approach has been limited by their problems: signature-based intrusion detection can identify the known intrusions but cannot detect the novel intrusions, anomaly-based intrusion detection has the potential to detect all intrusions but has the limitation of a higher false alarm rate. For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, it is also found that static analysis (Wagner, et al., 2001), with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495951","","Access control;Authentication;Computational efficiency;Computer applications;Face detection;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling","digital signatures;feature extraction;program diagnostics","anomaly-based intrusion detection;behavior model;feature vector;information security infrastructure;model inaccuracy;model incompleteness;signature-based intrusion detection;static analysis","","4","1","27","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).","0840-7789;08407789","978-1-4799-5827-6;9781479958276","","10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395","Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole","","0","","20","","","3-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.","","1-4244-0800-8;1424408008","1-4244-0801-6;1424408016","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146353","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Entropy;Information systems;Intrusion detection;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;security of data;telecommunication security","feature selection;lightweight intrusion detection model;maximum entropy model;network intrusion detection system","","3","","8","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OppNets exploit the characteristics of the human social, such as similarities, daily routines, mobility patterns and interests to perform the message routing and data sharing. Packet dropping attack is one of the hardest attacks in Opportunistic Networks as both the source nodes and the destination nodes have no knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a new malicious nodes detection technique against packet faking attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and instead of them injects new fake packets. We have called this novel attack in our previous works a packet faking attack. Each node in Opportunistic Networks can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, hash chain techniques. In our hash chain based defense techniques we have two phases. The first phases is to detect the attack, and the second phases is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature. In our simulation, we have achieved a very high node detection accuracy and low false negative rate.","","978-1-4673-8172-7;9781467381727","","10.1109/ICCSNT.2015.7490890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490890","Denial-of-Service;Malicious Node Detection;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attacks;Security","Australia;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Information technology;Network coding;Routing","","","","","","16","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host.

We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energyefficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, S-MAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.","1548-0992;15480992","","","10.1109/TLA.2010.5595126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5595126","Cross-layer design;Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Routing;Throughput;Wireless Sensor Network","Irrigation;Jitter;Multimedia communication;Silicon compounds;Streaming media;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","multimedia communication;real-time systems;wireless sensor networks","LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multi-channel approach;dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism;real-time multimedia wireless sensor networks","","1","","14","","","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9;9781479964529","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","4","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"IEEE Draft Health Informatics - Point-Of-Care Medical Device Communication - Technical Report - Guidelines for the Use of RF Wireless Technology","","","IEEE Unapproved Draft Std P11073-00101/D5, Jun 2008","20080707","2008","","","","","The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073-0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559609","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6;9781424476756","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we selectively cap the packet payload to reduce write speed and storage requirements on hard drives and further reduce the computational burden of packet analysis. The proposed techniques take advantage of most packet payloads being useless for analysis purposes, because they are either encrypted or in a proprietary application non-readable format. Conversely, non-ASCII packets from well-known protocols and protocols with some ASCII data are fully captured as they may be potentially useful for network analysis. We have named this approach as selective capping, and we have implemented and integrated it into a high-speed network driver and a software module at user level, to make its operation more transparent and faster to upper layer applications.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1;9781479939251","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","24","3","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out.

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059537","Bayes rule;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE);secure routing;strategy","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Mobile computing;Receivers;Routing protocols","Bayes methods;cryptographic protocols;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANETs;PBE strategy;anonymous behaviors;belief updating systems;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;game theory model;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;regular nodes;reputation system;secure routing protocol;security attacks","","0","","","","","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1092-1648;10921648","978-1-4244-1587-8;9781424415878","978-1-4244-1588-5;9781424415885","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","13","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection of the causes of defects may possibly lead to an improvement in production. However, the production records generally contain an enormous set of features. It is almost impossible in practice to monitor all features at once. This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy. In addition, with MapReduce on the cloud, the performance can be increased by 17.5 times.","1521-9097;15219097","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2013.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6808251","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Manufacturing Data;MapReduce;k-Nearest Neighbor","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Manufacturing;Monitoring;Testing","genetic algorithms;manufacturing data processing;pattern classification;security of data","MapReduce GA;anomaly detection;feature reduction technique;genetic algorithm;k-nearest neighborhood classifier;kNN;manufacturing data;production records","","1","","14","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People have become increasingly dependent on the Internet to perform various tasks. Networks require a system that protects against intrusion activities. Therefore, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been created. Subsequently, IDSs have become an important part of modern networks to detect suspicious attacks. Modern networks expand and operate at high speeds, which is why handling all network traffic without overlooking security issues is difficult for IDS that run on a single processor. In this paper, we proposed a shared memory design called Hybrid Multi-Pattern Algorithm (HMA) as extension of our previous work, multi-core based HMA. The experiments show that GPGPU based HMA performs better than multi-core based HMA. This finding proves that GPGPU-based HMA is robust and can function properly in a high-speed network.","","978-1-4799-5685-2;9781479956852","","10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072704","GPGPU;High speed network;Hybrid multi-pattern algorithm;Intrusion detection system;Pattern matching","Computers;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Payloads","computer network security;graphics processing units;pattern matching;shared memory systems","GPGPU based hybrid multipattern algorithm design;GPGPU-based HMA;IDS;high-speed intrusion detection system;high-speed network;intrusion detection systems;network traffic handling;shared memory design;suspicious attack detection","","0","","23","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using wireless sensors greatly decreases the wiring costs and increases the volume of data gathered for plant monitoring. However, ensuring the security of the deployed sensor network, which is part of the overall security of PCS, is of crucial importance. In this paper, we design a model-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for sensor networks used for PCS. Given that PCS tends to have regular traffic patterns and a well-defined request-response communication, we can design an IDS that models normal behavior of the entities and detects attacks when there is a deviation from this model. Model-based IDS can prove useful in detecting unknown attacks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-2574-7;9781424425747","978-1-4244-2575-4;9781424425754","10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4660125","","Communication system security;Costs;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Personal communication networks;Process control;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks;Wiring","process control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","attack detection;model-based intrusion detection system;network security;request-response communication;traffic pattern;wireless process control system;wireless sensor network","","8","","9","","","Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools used to detect and analyse such attacks need to evolve continuously as well in order to cope with such attacks. In this paper, we identify some limitation of existing approaches and propose a novel architecture for an attack detection and analysis framework. This architecture is based on virtualization technology to execute target systems, supports a broad spectrum of low-level tracing modules and sophisticated, extensible virtual-machine introspection mechanisms, combined with an extensible plug-in interface for specialized detection and analysis mechanisms, and it offers support for deployment in cloud infrastructures.","1529-4188;15294188","978-1-4799-5721-7;9781479957217","","10.1109/DEXA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974866","Intrusion Detection;Malware Analysis;attack detection;plug-in architecture","Computer architecture;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines;virtualisation","IT systems;analysis mechanisms;cloud infrastructures;extensible plug-in interface;flexible virtualization-based architecture;low-level tracing modules;malicious attacks;malware analysis;malware detection;specialized detection mechanisms;virtual-machine introspection mechanisms;virtualization technology","","0","","29","","","1-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
