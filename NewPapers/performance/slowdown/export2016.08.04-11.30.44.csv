The military holds higher standards of security requirements and thus require special intrusion detection applications. Conventional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) require central control and monitoring entities and thus cannot be applied to MANETs.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","5","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, the paper proposes the Templates Finite Automata Grouping Algorithm (TFA), which divides rule sets into different groups based on templates of the rules. Each group is used to construct its corresponding matching engine. At the meantime, the number of rule subsets is altered according to the quantity of actual rules and the structure of a system to achieve better matching efficiency. Theoretical analysis and the experiments conducted indicate that comparing with the conventional grouping algorithms, the TFA requires far fewer groups at the relatively similar level of storage space compression; and comparing with other classical DFA improved algorithms, the TFA achieves shorter pretreatment time and demands smaller storage space with no noticeably decrease in the matching efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354737","deterministic finite automata;grouping algorithm;regular expression;rule templates;templates finite automata","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Engines;Explosions;Switches","deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;security of data","DFA;TFA;deterministic finite automata;intrusion detection system;regular expression matching algorithm;template finite automata grouping algorithm","","","","13","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.

In this paper we have proposed a novel and robust IDS for MANETs that aims to combine misuse with anomaly detection.

A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) the structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, especially significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable.

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects.

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3;9781424460373","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","24","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8;9781457701108","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","2","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes.

Fourth International Conference on","20080624","2007","","","449","458","Unauthorized rogue access points (APs), such as those brought into a corporate campus by employees, pose a security threat as they may be poorly managed or insufficiently secured. Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1;9781424414321","978-1-4244-1433-8;9781424414338","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","1","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks.

But network links are getting faster and faster, and string matching is getting more and more difficult to perform in real time. Traditional processors are not keeping up with the performance demands, whereas specialized hardware will never be able to compete with commodity hardware in terms of cost effectiveness, reusability and ease of programming. Advanced multi-core architectures like the IBM Cell Broadband Engine promise unprecedented performance at a low cost, thanks to their popularity and production volume. Nevertheless, the suitability of the cell processor to string matching has not been investigated so far. In this paper we investigate the performance attainable by the cell processor when employed for string matching algorithms based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). Our findings show that the cell is an ideal candidate to tackle modern security needs: two processing elements alone, out of the eight available on one cell processor provide sufficient computational power to filter a network link with bit rates in excess of 10 Gbps.","1530-2075;15302075","1-4244-0909-8;1424409098","1-4244-0910-1;1424409101","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228362","","Automata;Computer networks;Costs;Data security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Production","cellular automata;deterministic automata;finite state machines;security of data;string matching","IBM Cell Broadband Engine;cell processor;deterministic finite-state automata;intrusion detection system;multicore architecture;string matching","","12","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, many applications would benefit from monitoring data gathered at multiple vantage points within a network infrastructure. This paper presents the design and implementation of DiMAPI, an application programming interface for distributed passive network monitoring. DiMAPI extends the notion of the network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote monitoring sensors. Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the monitoring sensors. A broad range of monitoring applications can benefit from DiMAPI to efficiently perform advanced monitoring tasks over a potentially large number of passive monitoring sensors","1542-1201;15421201","1-4244-0142-9;1424401429","","10.1109/NOMS.2006.1687568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1687568","","Application software;Computer network management;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information security;Internet;Measurement;Passive networks;Remote monitoring;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;application program interfaces;computerised monitoring","DiMAPI;Internet;application programming interface;distributed network monitoring;distributed passive network monitoring;network flow;passive monitoring sensors","","5","4","46","","","3-7 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Johnson","","Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","185","190","A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes. The proposed scheme can select the best nodes to be used as PGKs from all available ones considering their security conditions and energy states.

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay.

Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%.

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product.

Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

In particular, we classify MITM attacks based on several parameters, like location of an attacker in the network, nature of a communication channel, and impersonation techniques. Based on an impersonation techniques classification, we then provide execution steps for each MITM class. We survey existing countermeasures and discuss the comparison among them.

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security.

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","2324-8149;23248149","978-1-61284-295-0;9781612842950","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5;9781424481835","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e.g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis. It is shown that AP3A can resist major attacks for security protection and privacy preservation, and can be an efficient authentication approach for V2G networks.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2212730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6336849","Authentication;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Electric vehicles;Privacy;Protocols;Vehicles","battery powered vehicles;power system protection;power system security;smart power grids","AP3A;V2G network;aggregated pseudostatus variation;aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication;attack analysis;battery vehicle charging status;communication resource;multiple BV power status;performance analysis;secure identification;security protection analysis;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid network","","14","","31","","2012-10-22","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class.

Although open source security has been around for years, it has never been as widely used as open source products like the Linux OS or Apache Web server have been. John Pescatore, Internet security research director at market-research firm Gartner Inc., said open source security tools now represent 3 to 5 percent of security-software usage but could comprise 10 to 15 percent by 2007. A key factor in this potential growth is the quality of numerous open source security packages. Open source software products include free tools that users can download from the Internet, packages that come with commercial vendor support, and tools bundled with closed source products. The most popular tools include Netfilter and iptables; intrusion-detection systems such as Snort, Snare, and Tripwire; vulnerability scanners like Nessus and Saint; authentication servers such as Kerberos; and firewalls like T.Rex.

Liu","Microsoft Corporation, Mountain View","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","2","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is functional in either a stand-alone manner or connected to large networks. In this work, a hybrid optimization technique using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Cuckoo Search (CS) is proposed for the optimization of MANET routing.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation.

To fulfill these requirements, there is a need to shift from traditional computing practices to new computing practices that give access to a broader network, unlimited resources, and enables self-service on demand at a reasonable cost using pay per use method. All these requirements can be fulfilled with cloud computing. Cloud Computing has a number of advantages as well as disadvantages. Security is a major threat to the cloud computing because the data placed on cloud servers is always vulnerable as there are lots of attackers on the internet who tries to compromise the security of the cloud. To overcome this issue, we use security appliances in the form of physical machines or by virtualization. A significant amount of power is consumed by security appliances which not only leads to the high energy costs but also a major threat to the environment as carbon-dioxide is released.

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These systems must be able to deal with today's high speed and large scale networks. In this paper we propose a distributed IDS that performs both data capturing and data analyzing in a distributed fashion. This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","1","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","5","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Therefore, it is possible to perform an accurate IP traceback using a probabilistic packing marking method and a hash-based traceback method.","","978-0-7695-3407-7;9780769534077","","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682283","802.16e;Bloom Filter;IP Traceback;Markov Chain;Probabilistic Packet Marking","Access control;Computer crime;Computer science;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Information technology;Network topology;Pressing;Protocols","IP networks;Markov processes;cryptography;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN","802.16e;DDoS attacks;IP traceback;Markov chain;WiBro;bloom filter;hash-based traceback;network resource;network topology;probabilistic packing marking","","0","","12","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-2676-8;9781424426768","978-1-4244-2677-5;9781424426775","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A lightweight hybrid security framework for wireless sensor networks","H. Sedjelmaci; S. M. Senouci","DRIVE Lab., Univ. of Bourgogne, Nevers, France","2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","20140828","2014","","","3636","3641","On the one hand, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have shown their ability to detect internal and external attacks with a high accuracy. On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
