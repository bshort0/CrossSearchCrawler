Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity in order to meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","23","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on regular expressions pattern matching engines implemented in reconfigurable hardware. A nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) based implementation was presented, which takes advantage of new basic building blocks to support more complex regular expressions than the previous approaches. The methodology is supported by a tool that automatically generates the circuitry for the given regular expressions, outputting VHDL representations ready for logic synthesis. Furthermore, techniques to reduce the area cost of our designs and maximize performance when targeting FPGAs were included. Experimental results show that our tool is able to generate a regular expression engine to match more than 500 IDS regular expressions (from the Snort ruleset) using only 25K logic cells and achieving 2 Gbps throughput on a Virtex2 and 2.9 on a Virtex4 device.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4244-8454-6;9781424484546","978-1-4244-8455-3;9781424484553","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems are termed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Intrusion Detection is the process of monitoring and identifying attempted unauthorized systems access or manipulation. Successful High Performance Computing (HPC) requires a combination of technical innovation as well as political and operational experience to balance out the many (sometimes contradictory) pressures encountered in this field.

On the other hand, we are witnessing an increasing number of zero day attacks. Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model. Emerging attacks such as Conficker remain dormant in our proposed architecture in order to avoid detection.

The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6;9780769533476","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","4","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","1738-9445;17389445","978-89-968650-2-5;9788996865025","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

The lack of infrastructuresupport and resource constraint is the key issue that causesdishonest and non-co-operative nodes. Therefore, MANET isvulnerable to serious attacks. To reduce the hazards from suchnodes and enhance the security of the network, this paperextends an Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector(AOMDV) Routing protocol, named as Trust-based Secured Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (TS-AOMDV), whichis based on the nodes' routing behavior. The proposed TSAOMDVaims at identifying and isolating the attacks such asflooding, black hole, and gray hole attacks in MANET. With thehelp of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and trust-based routing, attack identification and isolation are carried out in two phases ofrouting such as route discovery and data forwarding phase. IDSfacilitates complete routing security by observing both controlpackets and data packets that are involved in the routeidentification and the data forwarding phases. To improve therouting performance, the IDS integrates the measured statisticsinto the AOMDV routing protocol for the detection of attackers. This facilitates the TS-AOMDV to provide better routingperformance and security in MANET. Finally, the Trust basedSecured AOMDV, TS-AOMDV is compared with the existingAOMDV through the NS2 based simulation model. Theperformance evaluation reveals that the proposed TS-AOMDVimproves the performance in terms of throughput by 57.1%more than that of an AOMDV under adversary scenario.

Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X;0743166X","1-4244-1047-9;1424410479","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","20","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries. Finally, we present the implementation and performance evaluation of four popular network traffic monitoring applications built on top of Scap.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901242","Traffic monitoring;overload control;packet capture;packet filtering;performance;stream reassembly","Instruction sets;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Packet loss;Protocols","parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Scap;Stream capture library;TCP segmentation;TCP stream reassembly;connection-oriented analysis;data movement operations;high-speed network;intrusion detection;multicore architectures;network monitoring;parallel processing;stream-oriented network traffic capture;stream-oriented traffic processing;traffic classification","","2","","54","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. The host based systems as well as the network based systems have their own limitations. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present NIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces some significant problems contained by the previous systems such as trust issues and message spreading problems.

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET.

The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here.

It allows administrators to specify low-level network access control policies for each INFOCON level using high-level policies (adapted from the Smart Firewalls approach). The high-level policies are securely distributed to all the policy decision points in the network, which evaluate and enforce policies in a distributed manner. As a consequence of enforcing policies in response to INFOCON level changes, appropriate access control policies will be derived and applied to local firewall devices without human intervention.

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack.

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead.

However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process.

"Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection","K. Namjoshi; G.

A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions.

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population. Our preliminary experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic database traces show that our methods work well in practical situations","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2461-3;0769524613","","10.1109/CSAC.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565245","","Access control;Data privacy;Data security;Database systems;Demography;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Spatial databases","authorisation;data mining;database management systems","DBMS;RBAC-administered databases;anomalous behavior detection;assurance security solution;data privacy;database management system;database mining;intruder identification;intrusion detection system;role based access control","","19","1","25","","","5-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for SANs is to provide secure storage, which implies data integrity and data confidentiality. In this article we propose a solution that addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose a novel security architecture for SAN that uses a secure group communication protocol to provide efficient group keying without involving any centralized servers.

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4;9781849199094","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A variety of attacks such as Warmhole, Blackhole, Byzantine, Rushing/Flooding, Anonymity/Location Disclosure, Denial of Service etc have been identified and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, existing published solutions typically concentrate on particular type of attacks and are incapable of identifying threats, which occur as a result of combination of these attacks. As overall security level is determined by the system's weakest point, a distributed security scheme that uses an integrated approach to address a combination of these attacks is very much necessary. The work in progress aims to investigate the possible combination of attacks that can be addressed by integrating some of the existing work on mobile ad hoc networks security, which addresses a portion of the security concerns individually. The analysis of attacks and existing mechanisms that would help to design an integrated approach for security services is presented in this paper.","","978-1-4673-8809-2;9781467388092","","10.1109/HMI.2016.7449197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449197","Communication Network Security;MANET Security;Secure Routing;Security Survey","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;attacks analysis;distributed security scheme;mission-critical application;mobile ad hoc network security;mobile host collection;secure routing;wireless network communication","","","","50","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite security issues delaying its adoption, cloud computing has already become an unstoppable force; thus, security mechanisms to ensure its secure adoption are an immediate need. Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss developing a comprehensive trust management framework to support the establishment and evolution of trust among different cloud service providers.","","978-1-4673-0683-6;9781467306836","978-1-936968-32-9;9781936968329","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144819","Cloud computing;collaborative IDPS;distributed IDPS;intrusion detection","Computational modeling;Indium tin oxide;Load modeling;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;security of data","architectural levels;cloud computing environments;cloud service providers;distributed collaborative and data-driven intrusion detection;global layer;host layer;infrastructure level;intrusion detection and prevention systems;logical layers;network layer;platform levels;security mechanisms;software levels","","2","","28","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980;11106980","978-1-4244-4214-0;9781424442140","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To couple the network with real world tightly, we provide a network-wide time synchronization through the introduction of abstractions for cluster and hierarchy. Generally the error of time synchronization has the tendency of being accumulated as the hop count along the synchronization path increases in multi-hop wireless sensor network. Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path. We then apply different optimal synchronization mechanisms to the cluster heads and cluster members for the sake of power efficiency through an explicit broadcast manner.

In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations.

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","2","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method.

This paper traces the development of an information assurance (IA) architecture for Army installations. Early in 1999, as a critical initiative within the Army's Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture (I3A) project, the Army's ODISC4 Architectures Directorate undertook the task of developing an IA architecture overlay that could be applied to Army installation communications and computer network backbones. Following DoD's Defense-In-Depth philosophy and taking into account current and emerging DoD and Army IA policies, a multiorganizational team continues to develop a flexible, capabilities-based IA architecture that blends Army IA concepts with accepted best practices from the commercial world. The emerging architecture is being applied to both ATM and TCP/IP networks and is enabling the Army to tailor installation IA implementations to meet unique mission requirements. The paper describes and discusses the various policies, capabilities, techniques, and types of produces that are currently included in the architecture including firewalls, security enabled routers, and proxy servers. Some of the challenges that are facing Army networks such as electronic commerce and issues associated with malicious code are presented along with potential solutions that are currently being investigated including the use of technologies like e-mail scanning servers and virtual private networks.

In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast. Based on this, we also design a simple IDS and conduct tests by integrating it into SPMOS and GPOS.

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified. The paper provides a classification of attacks and defense techniques and shows how flow-based techniques can be used to detect scans, worms, Botnets and (DoS) attacks.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2010.032210.00054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5455789","Botnets;DoS;Network flows;attacks;intrusion detection;scan;worms","","IP networks;computer network security;data flow analysis;invasive software","Botnets;DoS attacks;IP flow based intrusion detection;data flow;packet inspection;worms","","61","","82","","2010-04-26","Third Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","3","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we try to build an efficient defense system based on a cooperative scheme to detect intrusions in AODV-based ad hoc networks using clustering technique and Back Propagation Network (BPN). A clustering architecture provides network scalability and fault tolerance, and results in more efficient use of network resources.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

Self-configuration enables the system to automatically configure security system and change the configuration of its resources and their operational policies at runtime in order to manage the system security. Our self-configuration approach is implemented using two software modules: component management interface (CMI) to specify the configuration and operational policies associated with each component that can be a hardware resource or a software component; and component runtime manager (CRM) that manages the component operations using the policies defined in CMI.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","1","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, open source web applications allow attackers a complete map of its structure, design and functionality. In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications. As a webmaster, I cannot imagine a better lights-out monitoring solution that not only notifies me, but also blocks potentially malicious access.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051949","","Electronic mail;Monitoring;Security;Testing;Web servers;Web sites","Web sites;computer crime;public domain software","Sniper framework;Webmasters;attack attempts detection;attackers;business Websites;intrusion detection;malicious access;official Websites;open source Web applications;personal Websites;security aspect;sensitive data;social network Websites;suspicious traffic monitoring","","0","","26","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First is that the worm's propagation behavior is expressed as tree-like structures. Second is that the worm's selection of infection targets does not consider which hosts its infected host communicates too frequently.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks.

However there are several significant challenges in securing cloud infrastructures from different types of attacks. The focus of this paper is on the security services that a cloud provider can offer as part of its infrastructure to its customers (tenants) to counteract these attacks. Our main contribution is a security architecture that provides a flexible security as a service model that a cloud provider can offer to its tenants and customers of its tenants. Our security as a service model while offering a baseline security to the provider to protect its own cloud infrastructure also provides flexibility to tenants to have additional security functionalities that suit their security requirements. The paper describes the design of the security architecture and discusses how different types of attacks are counteracted by the proposed architecture. We have implemented the security architecture and the paper discusses analysis and performance evaluation results.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2014.041614.120394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805344","Cloud security;security and privacy;security architecture","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Operating systems;Privacy;Security;Software as a service;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data","Internet;baseline security;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloud infrastructures;cloud provider;data storage;security architecture;security functionalities;security requirements;security-as-a-service model;service provisioning","","9","","37","","","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Accelerating snort NIDS using NetFPGA-based Bloom filter","R. Al-Dalky; K. Salah; H. Otrok; M. Al-Qutayri","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, UAE","2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)","20140925","2014","","","869","874","In recent years, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have faced a serious throughput challenge as a result of the rapid increase of network links to 1 and 10 Gbps rates. Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","1","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If care is not taken and if this network threats are not detected and mitigated on time, this will result into the serious network damage and data loss. Every organization should give priority for Finding and avoiding rogue wireless access points. For detection of unauthorized AP', we have use clock skew as a parameter of a wireless access point (AP). For detecting Rogue access point using clock skews method in wireless LAN network overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. For calculating clock skew of AP, we have use IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We mainly focus on implementation of least-square fit method for this purpose though we have explain both approach for detecting clock skew From this studies we came to known that use of clock skews appears to be an effective and robust method for detecting fake AP's in wireless local area networks.","","978-93-80544-10-6;9789380544106","","10.1109/IndiaCom.2014.6828057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828057","AP;Beacon Frame;Clock skews;MAC address;RAP;Time Synchronization Function (TSF);WLAN","Clocks;Communication system security;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Synchronization;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;least squares approximations;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 time synchronization function time stamp;RAP;TSF time stamp;authorization;beacon/probe response frame;clock skew detection;clock skews method;data loss;illegal access point detection;least-square fit method;network damage;network threat;rogue access point;rogue wireless access point;rough access point;secure network;security threat;system administrator wireless networks;unauthorized AP;wireless LAN network;wireless local area network","","0","","20","","","5-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypots provide a platform for studying the methods and tools used by the intruders (blackhat community), thus deriving their value from the unauthorized use of their resources. This paper discusses the design of a dynamic honeypot, which is an autonomous honeypot capable of adapting in a dynamic and constantly changing network environment. The dynamic honeypot approach integrates passive or active probing and virtual honeypots. This approach addresses the challenge of deploying and configuring virtual honeypots.","","0-7803-8577-2;0780385772","","10.1109/PERSER.2004.1356776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1356776","","Artificial intelligence;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Modems;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","active probing;blackhat community;changing network environment;dynamic honeypot design;intrusion detection system;passive probing;unauthorized use;virtual honeypots","","6","4","17","","","19-23 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
