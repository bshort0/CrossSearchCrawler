Although there are tools that allow testing Web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in Web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.","","978-1-4244-5183-8;9781424451838","978-0-7695-3811-2;9780769538112","10.1109/SCC.2009.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283945","","Data security;Informatics;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Relational databases;Runtime;Stress;Testing;Web services","SQL;Web services;program testing;security of data","SQL injection vulnerabilities;Web services;XPath injection vulnerabilities;security vulnerabilities","","14","2","23","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our aim is to develop such a system that operates on signatures extracted from execution profiles. These signatures are not descriptions of exploits, but instead are descriptions of the program conditions that lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, i.e., they depend on the structure of the vulnerabilities themselves. A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching. To evaluate our technique, we implemented it for Java programs and applied it on Tomcat 3.0 in order to detect well-known attacks. Our results were promising, as no false negatives and a maximum of 4.5% false positives were observed, and the runtime overhead was less than 5%.","","978-1-4244-3725-2;9781424437252","","10.1109/IWSESS.2009.5068454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068454","","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Conferences;Databases;Intrusion detection;Java;Pattern matching;Probes;Runtime","Java;digital signatures;program diagnostics;security of data","Java programs;Tomcat 3.0;execution profiles;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;online signature matching;program analysis;program statements;security mechanism;signature extraction;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","26","","","19-19 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5;9781457700255","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2005.","20060123","2005","3","","6 pp.","","Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest. Additionally, the checkpoint latency of our approach is up to 52% faster than KVM's default method.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846477","Checkpointing;Cloud;Virtualization","Checkpointing;Kernel;Linux;Memory management;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerance;virtual machines;virtualisation","C/R mechanisms;VMI;checkpoint/restart mechanisms;cloud computing environments;fault tolerance;system-level virtualization;virtual machine introspection","","0","","30","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

However, they are often conducted separately. In this paper, we present an approach for integrating fault-tree-based safety analysis into statechart-based functional modeling. The proposed approach uses systematic transformation steps that maintain the semantics of both the fault tree and the statechart. It also provides a set of conversion rules that transform the gates of fault trees into statechart notations. The resultant model shows how the system behaves when a failure condition occurs and acts as a basis model that ensures safety through requirement validation. Using the gas burner case study, we demonstrate the advantages of the integrated model over the use of separate models, such as the lack of ambiguities, separation of concerns, and taking the order of the occurrence of faults into consideration.","1083-4427;10834427","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2093889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682414","Fault integration;fault tree analysis (FTA);software reliability;software safety;software validation;statecharts","Analytical models;Fault trees;Logic gates;Radiation detectors;Safety;Semantics;Software","embedded systems;fault trees;software fault tolerance;system recovery","failure condition;fault-tree-based safety analysis;gas burner case study;safety-critical embedded systems;semantics;statechart-based functional modeling","","11","","42","","2011-01-10","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance. Moreover, it is fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware and requires no modifications to system call APIs, therefore legacy commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications can be also easily reused.","","978-0-7695-3492-3;9780769534923","","10.1109/EUC.2008.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756331","Detection;Recovery;Reliability;Security","Data security;Data structures;Embedded system;Kernel;Object detection;Protection;Prototypes;Runtime;Software prototyping;System performance","application program interfaces;data structures;embedded systems;operating system kernels;security of data;system monitoring;system recovery","commercial-off-the-shelf application;embedded system;kernel data structure;kernel object;kernel source code;lightweight system-level detection;recovery infrastructure;runtime protection;security attack;system call API;system call function;vulnerable system call","","0","","22","","","17-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, anomaly based IDS are usually prone to high false positive rate due to difficulties involved in defining normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. In this paper, we employ two different statistical methods viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop new anomaly based IDS models. We then evaluate the performance of these IDS models on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set and analyze their performance against other IDS models based on Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the performance (Accuracy and Detection Rate) of both the LDA and the LR based models are at par and in some cases even better than other IDS models. Moreover, unlike the IDS model based on complex method like the SVM, the proposed LDA and LR based IDS models are computationally more efficient, which makes them more suited for deployment in real time network monitoring and intrusion detection analysis.","","978-1-4673-7398-2;9781467373982","","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443533","C4.5;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA);Logistic Regression (LR);NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Data models;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;regression analysis;security of data;support vector machines","C4.5;IDS;LDA;LR;SVM;acceptable behavior recognition;anomalous network behaviors;anomaly based intrusion detection system;benchmark NSL-KDD data set;intrusion detection analysis;intrusion detection systems;linear discriminant analysis;logistic regression;naive Bayes;network traffic patterns;performance evaluation;real time network monitoring;statistical methods;support vector machine","","","","15","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9;9781467362399","978-0-7695-4952-1;9780769549521","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

At the link adaptation layer, the virtual interface provides link transparency to the upper layers and session management is handled at the interface manager. At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns. Simulation results show that our approach can deliver low packet loss, low latency, and smooth handoff solutions with minimum packet overhead. Further, our research on IEEE 802.21 reveals that current media independent handover (MIH) may serve as a component in our integrated architecture.

In this paper we describe the UNISON middleware architecture, which seeks to provide such functionality in the form of loosely-coupled, distributed publish/subscribe messaging, distributed key-value data persistence, and basic local component control. Taken in isolation, the individual parts of UNISON encompass features already present in existing systems and infrastructures, however, UNISON combines these into a consistent whole, providing data storage/distribution and messaging/control in a simple, light-weight and unified fashion. We have prototyped UNISON as a self-standing middleware platform, and have used the resulting prototype to support a (similarly prototypical) generic, autonomous cyber defence system from DST Group's HINDER project. We discuss our experiences with UNISON in the context of this system. As the UNISON architecture is still work in progress, our aim in this paper is to describe its current state, with the belief that the underlying design decisions will provide valuable insight when attempting to design related software infrastructures for supporting cyber defence systems.","1530-0803;15300803","","","10.1109/ASWEC.2015.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365809","autonomous cyber defence;cyber security;intrusion detection;intrusion response;middleware;software architecture","Australia;Computer architecture;Context;Distributed databases;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Peer-to-peer computing","middleware;security of data","DST Group;HINDER project;UNISON middleware architecture;autonomous cyber defence system;data distribution;data storage;distributed key-value data persistence;distributed publish/subscribe messaging;local component control;self-standing middleware platform","","","","38","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down. In this paper we present the principle of buffer overflow attacks, a taxonomy of defense methods, the implementation details of RAD, and the performance analysis of the RAD prototype","","0-7695-1077-9;0769510779","","10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918971","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Libraries;Measurement;Program processors;Protection;Prototypes;Taxonomy","program compilers;security of data","RAD;arbitrary programs;binary code;buffer overflow attacks;compile-time solution;compiler patch;network-attached computer system;return address defender;security;stack frames","","38","7","26","","","Apr 2001","16 Apr 2001-19 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can also detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks that are executed over long periods of time. A significant attribute of our approach is that it is amenable to detecting unknown attacks as well after appropriate modification of bufSTAT.","","0-7695-2369-2;0769523692","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607577","","Automata;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Educational institutions;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Time factors","","","","0","","5","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2537331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423661","Static-sensor networks;mobile-target detection;optimal deployment","Genetic algorithms;Mobile communication;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking","object detection;sensors","dynamic approach;expanding search areas;mobile-target detection;natural terrain variation;on-line reconfigurability;sensor network deployment;static-sensor network;unstructured search areas","","","","63","","2016-03-02","June1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates.

In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity.

Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","0-7803-7952-7;0780379527","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations.

"Security architecture for system wide information management","B. Stephens","Tectura Corp., Bellevue, WA, USA","24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","20051227","2005","2","","10 pp. Vol. 2","","Air Traffic Service Providers (ATSPs) are embarking on a transition of their information systems to a new paradigm of System Wide Information Management (SWIM). SWIM defines an enterprise-wide open, flexible, modular, manageable and secure architecture that is transparent to users. Information sharing, including real-time capability, enables operational improvements and facilitates a reduction in the overall cost of operation and maintenance. SWIM enables decision support systems that connect many stakeholders including the ATSPs and the Airline Operations Centers. For the National Airspace System (NAS), SWIM also facilitates information sharing between with other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Due to the increased interconnection of ATSP systems and connections to outside enterprises and agencies, security requirements have expanded. New SWIM applications will be written using new technologies. Adapters will be developed to connect legacy applications. The new technologies introduced by SWIM allow a more standardized approach to security, while supporting existing security mechanisms in legacy applications. This paper proposes a security architecture for SWIM, including Identity and Access Management, Registry-Directory-Naming services security, Messaging security, Digital Rights Management and Security Information Management. It also describes the security requirements for the Common Data Transport (CDT) that underlies SWIM, including link and network security, firewalls and intrusion detection systems.","2155-7195;21557195","0-7803-9307-4;0780393074","","10.1109/DASC.2005.1563474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563474","","Costs;Data security;Decision support systems;Identity management systems;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;National security;Terrorism","aerospace computing;air traffic control;authorisation;decision support systems;safety-critical software","Department of Homeland Security;National Airspace System;air traffic service provider;airline operations center;common data transport;decision support systems;digital rights management;firewalls;identity and access management;information sharing;intrusion detection systems;messaging security;network security;registry-directory-naming services security;security architecture;security information management;system wide information management","","0","","","","","30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks. We present a microarchitectural implementation of Minos that achieves negligible impact on cycle time with a small investment in die area, and minor changes to the Linux kernel to handle the tag bits and perform virtual memory swapping.","1072-4451;10724451","0-7695-2126-6;0769521266","","10.1109/MICRO.2004.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550996","","Computer science;Control systems;Counting circuits;Hardware;Internet;Kernel;Libraries;Linux;Microarchitecture;Protection","","","","67","41","36","","","04-08 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.","2165-9605;21659605","","","10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727844","Network search;distributed management;distributed query processing;innetwork management;matching and ranking","Databases;Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Search problems;Semantics;Web search","cloud computing;query processing","distributed query processing;echo protocol;network search queries;parallel processing;scalable matching;scalable ranking;search node","","3","","28","","","14-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","7","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Open medium, wide distribution and de-centralization of nodes makes MANETs vulnerable and malicious. It is crucial to develop efficient intrusion detection system to protect MANETs. A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism. We propose an optimize solution for above problem using BSA techniques which overcomes eaves dropping based on acknowledgement from intermediate only.","","978-1-4799-3835-3;9781479938353","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033819","Bandwidth Shared Acknowledgment (BSA);Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET);Random Casting;Swarm Detection","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Casting;Delays;Digital signatures;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;safety systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","2-hop acknowledgement;BSA techniques;MANET protection;bandwidth shared acknowledgment;connecting edges security;cryptography;eavesdropping;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing;multiple path establishment;network topology;node decentralization;node open medium;node wide distribution;random casting;seamless message delivery;secure intrusion detection system efficiency;source collision;source directed acknowledgement;swarm based detection techniques;transmission packet data","","0","","9","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2339-0;0769523390","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","8","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless and distributed nature of MANETs poses a great challenge to system security designers. Ad hoc networks are by nature very open to anyone. Their biggest advantage is also one of their biggest disadvantages: Anyone with the proper hardware and knowledge of the network topology and protocols can connect to the network. This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process. The entire routing system in MANET can even be brought down using the wormhole attack. This paper discusses the modes of wormholes, how wormholes disrupts routing in AODV, DSR, OLSR and then discusses the solutions and countermeasures on wormholes.","","978-1-4244-8678-6;9781424486786","978-1-4244-8679-3;9781424486793","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5942091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5942091","AODV;Counter measures;DSR;GPS;MAC;Malicious;OLSR;Wormhole","Hardware;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","AODV;DSR;MANET;OLSR;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;route establishment process;routing system;wireless adhoc networks;wormhole attacks","","1","","27","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","2159-3442;21593442","0-7803-9311-2;0780393112","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With mounting global network connectivity, the issue of intrusion has achieved importance, promoting active research on efficient Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions. Our design goal is to decrease the detection time for each connection by distributing the detectors to each host.","","978-1-4244-8599-4;9781424485994","978-89-88678-32-9;9788988678329","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713478","AIS;Agent;Danger Theory;Distributed;IDS","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Engines;Intrusion detection;Training","artificial immune systems;computer network security;distributed processing;genetic algorithms","AIS;IDS;anomalies detection;artificial immune system;bio-inspired model;distributed model;genetic algorithm;information security;intrusion detection system;network security","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design an adaptive multi-level secure computation algorithm with the goals of reducing the average communication overheads. The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected.

Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient.

Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4244-4153-2;9781424441532","978-0-7695-3650-7;9780769536507","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","10","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5;0780394275","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel version of the back propagation training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks that are used for detecting intruders based on the MPI standard on Linux PC clusters.

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well. If binary programs are found in traffic, they are automatically extracted and submitted to a malware analysis module of the sandbox. In this way, we can safely identify the intention of the attackers without making them aware of our surveillance.","","","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899231","dynamic analysis;malware;sandbox;targeted attack","Electronic mail;Indexes;Internet;Malware;Protocols;Servers","Internet;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;cyber attacks;integrated sandbox system;internal malicious network traffic analysis;internal networks;malware analysis module;mass infection malware;secure proxy;secure traffic analysis system;software defined networking technology;transparent proxy","","3","","9","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols.

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole.

Because multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks, a scheme called statistical analysis of multi-path (SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. As the name suggests, SAM detects wormhole attacks and identifies attackers by statistically analyzing the information collected by multi-path routing. Neither additional security services or systems nor security enhancement of routing protocols is needed in the proposed scheme.

Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot.

In this paper, we propose an effective method for defense against IP spoofing attack, which is based on traceroute and the cooperation with trusted adjacent nodes. We present the results of the experiment, compare the method with others. The result demonstrates that the method can effectively and steadily detect the IP spoofing attack, thereby blocks it.","2161-9646;21619646","978-1-4244-3708-5;9781424437085","978-1-4244-3709-2;9781424437092","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5601287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601287","","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer crime;Computer hacking;IP networks;Internet","IP networks;telecommunication security","IP spoofing attack;distributed denial of service attack;network security;worm/virus","","3","","9","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Experience Using Active and Passive Mapping for Network Situational Awareness","S. Webster; R. Lippmann; M. Zissman","MIT, USA","Fifth IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA'06)","20060814","2006","","","19","26","Passive network mapping has often been proposed as an approach to maintain up-to-date information on networks between active scans. This paper presents a comparison of active and passive mapping on an operational network. On this network, active and passive tools found largely disjoint sets of services and the passive system took weeks to discover the last 15% of active services. Active and passive mapping tools provided different, not complimentary information. Deploying passive mapping on an enterprise network does not reduce the need for timely active scans due to non-overlapping coverage and potentially long discovery times","","0-7695-2640-3;0769526403","","10.1109/NCA.2006.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1659471","","Computer crashes;Information security;Laboratories;Open source software;Operating systems;Passive networks;Peer to peer computing;Probes;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","active network mapping;network situational awareness;passive network mapping","","3","","16","","","24-26 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
