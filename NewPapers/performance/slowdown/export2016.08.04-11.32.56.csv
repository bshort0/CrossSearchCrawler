We have developed a decision tree-based method for detecting cyber attacks on a small-scale robotic vehicle using both cyber and physical features that can be measured by its on-board systems and processes. We evaluate it experimentally against a variety of scenarios involving denial of service, command injection and two types of malware attacks.

The transport scrubber's role is to convert ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream endpoints. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP/IP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","2166-9570;21669570","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6666573","","Cognitive radio;Noise;Principal component analysis;Probability;Resilience;Security;Sensors","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","CRAWDAD data repository;catastrophic performance degradation;cognitive radio networks;denial of service;genuine node failures;intelligent jamming;multidimensional cooperative spectrum sensing technique;multiple criteria analysis technique;nonparametric Bayesian inference method;physical layer;primary user emulation;spectrum holes;spectrum usage efficiency","","0","","16","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9;9781457713859","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","4","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","3","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents Bezoar, an automated full-system virtual machine-based approach to recover from zero-day control-flow hijacking attacks. Bezoar tracks down the source of network bytes in the system and after an attack, replays the checkpointed run while ignoring inputs from the malicious source. We evaluated our proof-of-concept prototype on six notorious exploits for Linux and Windows. In all cases, it recovered the full system state and resumed execution.

Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors. The technique has been successfully applied to detect attacks against widely-deployed applications, including the Apache Web server and the OpenSSH server.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377227","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Computer science;Computer security;Data mining;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","Internet;digital signatures;operating system kernels;program debugging;security of data;software maintenance","Apache Web server;OpenSSH server;application-level auditing;application-level bugs;application-logic errors;application-specific signatures;binary rewriting;buffer overflows;host security;intrusion detection systems;legacy systems;offline language tool;operating system kernel;syslog entries;system calls","","1","2","38","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This encompasses systems straddling across the globe allowing the access of sensitive as well as confidential data of the enterprise at any point in time. With rapid mounting proliferation of mobile devices but with limited resources, cloud computing has emerged as an obvious predilection for performing resource intensive tasks over the cloud. To address the security issues, cloud service providers (CSPs) are coming up with new services such as Security as a Service (SecaaS). From our analysis of security threats and its measures, we feel that additional controls are required for Identity and Access Management for mobile cloud users. We have made some security recommendations along with best practices for consumers and service providers to consider ensuring robust information security including IAM for growing mobile users in cloud.","","","","10.1109/ICACSIS.2013.6761561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6761561","","Authentication;Authorization;Cloud computing;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets","authorisation;cloud computing;mobile computing","CSP;IAM;SecaaS;access management;cloud computing;cloud mobile users;cloud service providers;confidential data access;credential management;enterprise information security measure;identity management;mobile cloud environment;mobile cloud users;mobile devices;resource intensive task;robust information security;security as a service;security recommendation;security threat analysis;sensitive data access","","6","","33","","","28-29 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy. This information can be used to devise integrated detection strategies by combining complementary approaches.

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","978-1-4244-2067-4;9781424420674","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","5","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamic virtual honeypots are effective tools for observing and attracting network intruder activity. This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices.

Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices.

The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","evasive attack;intrusion detection;protocol mimicry;protocol structure;state transition","Inspection;Intrusion detection;MIMICs;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","security of data","IDS-IPS;MimicHunter framework;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;firewall;information theft events;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network based intrusion;network security audit;network security devices;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection.

This is the need of various stakeholders to have the information they need to perform their decision tasks in a reliable fashion. This can be accomplished by offering them a common smart approach and the additional benefit of a global view, which they can use to compare their local situation with. This smart approach should utilize well proven existing global statistics, best practices and existing technical sensors, which can be adapted to the overall common framework. From this, output for all relevant stakeholders, like national assessments centers, can be generated to fulfill the individual needs. One possible input source could be the technical sensor technology, which has been developed by our Institute for Internet security and which we give to partners and other researchers free of charge.

In this paper we introduce FloTracker that is an online log-free host-based root-cause analysis detection engine, with instantaneous forensics capabilities. FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","1530-2075;15302075","1-4244-0909-8;1424409098","1-4244-0910-1;1424409101","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After the IR DNS update, the end users can get the indirect routing information by querying the DNS server, and set up indirect route to the target server accordingly. The IR DNS update is an essential part of the Secure Collective Defense (SCOLD) system, and it can be utilized independently as an extension to the existing DNS update utility. This technique can also be utilized to protect the root DNS servers from DDoS attacks. The implementation of the IR DNS update on BIND 9 is presented.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5;9781424462315","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT. This paper has provided the effective mechanism in creating well-formed defense against malicious SIP message attacks to ensure the integrity and security of VoIP subsystems.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083519","Intrusion detection system;Malicious message;SIP;SQL injection;VoIP","Inspection;Internet;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards;Syntactics","Internet telephony;client-server systems;computer network security;digital signatures;public domain software;signalling protocols;virtual machines","BackTrack7;IDS;Kphone;SER;SIP clients;SIP server;SIP-based infrastructure security;SIPSAK;SNORT;Session Initiation Protocol;VMware;VoIP communication;VoIP subsystem integrity;VoIP subsystem security;Voice over Internet Protocol communication;Windows 7;X-lite;attack signature generation technique;attack-signature generation framework;attacking tool;configuration file;detection rule improvement;intrusion detection system;logical error identification;malformed SIP message identification;malicious SIP message attacks;malicious SIP messages;malicious message attacks;malicious message identification;open architecture;open source IDS;open source SIP server;processing overheads;regular expression;security mechanisms;signaling protocol;signature database;testbed architecture;threat vulnerability;virtual environment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0;0769525490","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","4","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems the absence of a defence mechanism that can cope with different types of intrusions is of great importance. False positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the intrusion mean severe costs for the system. An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of OCSVM models.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","38","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed.

As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2517321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383218","Smart city;attack detection;chance discovery;software-defined networking;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Access control;Base stations;Hierarchical systems;Sensors;Smart cities;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;smart cities;software defined networking;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks","UCON technology;WSN hierarchical security framework;advanced persistent threat detection;chance discovery technology;dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism;high-level attacks;isolated defense component;low-level attack detection;network function virtualization;resource consumption;resource-restrained wireless sensor network;smart cities;smart services;software defined networking;sophisticated attacks;unknown attack detection;usage control technology","","","","35","","2016-01-14","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","12","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6;9781424422326","978-1-4244-2233-3;9781424422333","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605766","","Automatic control;Computer security;Control systems;Delay;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Runtime;Throughput","Internet;security of data;source coding;telecommunication security","accurate application-specific sandboxing policy;cybersecurity threats;hijacking attacks;production-mode network server;program semantics-aware intrusion detection system;source code;system call monitoring","","0","","24","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to unique characteristics, such as dynamic network topology, limited bandwidth, and limited battery power, routing in a MANET is a particularly challenging task compared to a conventional network. Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious. In this article, we investigate the state-of-the-art of security issues in MANET. In particular, we examine routing attacks, such as link spoofing and colluding misrelay attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks in existing MANET protocols.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4396947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4396947","","Bandwidth;Batteries;Costs;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Vehicles;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET protocols;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;routing attacks;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","","111","","23","","","October 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4673-1796-2;9781467317962","978-0-7695-4713-8;9780769547138","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","6","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","1","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and capable of supporting a large system-of-systems environment. At the same time, information security is an area of growing concern in the space business and among space agencies. Especially in the area of SOA-based environments, where interconnectivity of components is a core principle, an efficient and robust security concept needs to be put in place to ensure secure mission operations. In this paper, we describe an application security framework for SOA-based mission data systems. This framework increases significantly the robustness and security of web services and web applications through use of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and provision of tools & templates for SSA mission data system developers.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If enough peers participate, the overall system can survive isolated failures. Applying this approach to distributed file integrity checking (or similar security-sensitive areas) requires that current and untampered information is distributed among the peers in such a way that a limited number of malicious peers cannot subvert or sabotage the overall system. This paper presents a mechanism to provide such tamper-resistant replicated storage in a decentralised peer-to-peer system where no component is trusted a priori. We present a system model for our mechanism, and discuss the threats and countermeasures used to detect tampering. We also give an analysis of various distribution strategies and their respective costs and benefits as observed in our research implementation.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625293","","Bonding;Centralized control;Control systems;Cost benefit analysis;Distribution strategy;Fingerprint recognition;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Public key cryptography;Robustness","data integrity;digital signatures;peer-to-peer computing;storage management","decentralised peer-to-peer system;distributed file integrity checking;hierarchical signatures;malicious peers;peer-to-peer-based file replication;tamper-resistant replicated peer-to-peer storage;untampered information","","0","","13","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4673-0714-7;9781467307147","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to continue their malevolent activities without being detected, cyber criminals make efforts to conceal the core servers (e.g., C&C servers, exploit servers, and drop-zone servers) in the malicious web infrastructure. Such deliberate invisibility of those concealed malicious servers, however, makes them particularly distinguishable from benign web servers that are usually promoted to be public. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study to investigate the visibility of both malicious and benign servers. From our intensive analysis of over 100,000 benign servers, 45,000 malicious servers and 40,000 redirections, we identify a set of distinct features of malicious web infrastructures from their locations, structures, roles, and relationships perspectives, and propose a lightweight yet effective detection system called VisHunter. VisHunter identifies malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures. We evaluate VisHunter on both online public data and large-scale enterprise network traffic, and demonstrate that VisHunter can achieve an average 96.2% detection rate with only 0.9% false positive rate on the real enterprise network traffic.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524582","","Feature extraction;Indexes;Malware;Search engines;Superluminescent diodes;Web servers","","","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future.

The NoC Firewall checks the physical address and rejects untrusted CPU requests to on-chip memory, thus protecting legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC from the injection of malicious instructions or data to shared memory. Based on a validated kernel-space Linux system driver of the NoC Firewall which is seen as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric, we develop higher-layer security services that focus on physical address protection based on a set of rules.

Our architecture exploits multisensor data and supplementary information to identify defectors based on deviations from predicted values and correlated measurements and behavior. Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning.

WSNs are usually composed of a large number of low power sensors. They require a careful consumption of the available energy in order to prolong the lifetime of the network. From the security point of view, the overhead added to standard protocols must be as light as possible according to the required security level. Starting from the DESERT tool (P. Inverardi et al., 2005) which has been proposed for component-based software architectures, we derive a new framework that permits to dynamically enforce a set of properties of the sensors behavior. This is accomplished by an IDS specification that is automatically translated into few lines of code installed in the sensors. This realizes a distributed system that locally detects violation of the sensors interactions policies and is able to minimize the information sent among sensors in order to discover attacks over the network","1550-445X;1550445X","0-7695-2466-4;0769524664","","10.1109/AINA.2006.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1620363","","Computer science;Formal specifications;Intelligent networks;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Power system security;Protocols;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;object-oriented programming;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;component-based software architecture;distributed IDS;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless sensor network;security enhancement;standard protocol","","3","","7","","","18-20 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the proposed architecture, homeowners can monitor their basic energy usage information, and can perform necessary appliance management based on their pre-defined load priority, preferences, and comfort settings. The proposed architecture is designed based on the Standard Energy Usage Information (PAP10), which ensures interoperability among smart grid equipment. It is also designed with comprehensive security measures. It is expected that the proposed architecture can serve as a reference model for custom hardware designs and implementation of a real time, lightweight and reliable embedded web server for HEM applications in the smart grid environment.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816418","Smart grid;ZigBee communications and Home Energy Management;smart appliance interface","Energy management;Home appliances;Logic gates;Protocols;Standards;Web services;Zigbee","Web services;domestic appliances;energy management systems;information retrieval;smart power grids","Web services interface;appliance management;home energy management system;information retrieval;smart grid equipment;standard energy usage information","","3","","16","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Towards Intrusion Detection for Encrypted Networks","V. T. Goh; J. Zimmermann; M. Looi","Inf. Security Inst., Queensland Univ. of Technol., Brisbane, QLD","Availability, Reliability and Security, 2009. ARES '09. International Conference on","20090605","2009","","","540","545","Traditionally, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activities. However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results. Overall, the proposed approach is able to consistently detect intrusions and does not introduce any additional false positives.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066523","encrypted network;intrusion detection;malicious proxy;secret-sharing","Availability;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","cryptography;probability;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","NIDS;Shamir's secret-sharing scheme;VPN;encrypted network traffic;malicious activity detection;network-based intrusion detection system;probability;virtual private network","","2","","10","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Hybrid Detection Approach for Zero-Day Polymorphic Shellcodes","T. Chen; X. Zhang; Z. Liu","Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Univ. of Electron.

However, even the state-of-the-art NIDS has small chances of detecting them because they rely on known signatures. This paper presents hybrid detection for zero-day polymorphic shellcodes (HDPS) against shellcodes using various obfuscations. Our approach employs a heuristic approach to detect return address and filter mass innocent network flows, and then constructs a Markov model to detect the existence and location of executable codes in suspicious flows. Finally, it applies an elaborate approach to detect NOP Sleds in the executable codes. Initial experiments show HDPS detects nearly all types of shellcodes, and the false positive rate approximates zero with low overhead.","2161-5942;21615942","978-1-4244-2909-7;9781424429097","978-1-4244-2910-3;9781424429103","10.1109/EBISS.2009.5137874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137874","","Buffer overflow;Computer architecture;Computer science;Genetic mutations;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Statistics","Internet;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Markov model;NOP Sleds detection;complex obfuscation technique;heuristic approach;hybrid zero-day polymorphic shellcode detection approach;mass innocent network flow filtering;state-of-the-art NIDS;suspicious flow","","1","","10","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
