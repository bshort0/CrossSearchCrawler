Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These technologies have support of one of famous technique known as Adhoc Network. Adhoc Networks are assortment of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and also receiving attention in the scientific community. In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account. Proposed method optimizes the routing issues by using AODV. The result of this paper is an appropriate solution against neighbor attacks.","","978-1-4244-9683-9;9781424496839","","10.1109/EAIT.2011.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734955","AODV;MANETs;adhoc routing;flow capacity;ns2;relative position;signal strength","Ad hoc networks;Equations;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","Internet;mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology","GNDA;Internet technology;MANET;adhoc routing protocol;communication technology;flow capacity;good neighbor node detection;mobile node assortment;network topology;signal strength;wireless link;wireless technology","","0","","14","","","19-20 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In the paper we present a protocol specification based on the DHB-KEY scheme and its implementation for the well known TinyOS platform. A physical intrusion detection system in an office building is used to evaluate the protocol implementation. The evaluation shows that DHB-KEY is practical in real-world deployments.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-2574-7;9781424425747","978-1-4244-2575-4;9781424425754","10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4660127","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Mechanical factors;Message authentication;Protocols;Public key cryptography;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TinyOS platform;communication security;elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism;intrusion detection system;key distribution scheme;message authentication;single sink-initiated broadcast message;symmetric ciphers;wireless sensor networks","","5","","17","","","Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient Network Security Policy Enforcement With Policy Space Analysis","X. Wang; W. Shi; Y. Xiang; J. Li","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Network operators rely on security services to protect their IT infrastructures. Different kinds of network security policies are defined globally and distributed among multiple security middleboxes deployed in networks. However, due to the complexity of security policy, it is inefficient to directly employ existing path-wise enforcement approaches. This paper models the enforcement of network security policy as the set-covering problem, and designs a computational-geometry-based policy space analysis (PSA) tool for set operations of security policy. Leveraging the PSA, this paper first investigates the topological characteristics of different types of policies. This heuristic information reveals intrinsic complexities of security policy and guides the design of our enforcement approach. Then the paper proposes a scope-wise policy enforcement algorithm that selects a modest number of enforcement network nodes to deploy multiple policy subsets in a greedy manner. This approach can be employed on network topologies of both datacenter and service provider. The efficiencies of the PSA tool and the enforcement algorithm are also evaluated. Compared with the header space analysis, the PSA achieves much better memory and time efficiencies on set operations of security policy. Additionally, the proposed enforcement algorithm is able to guarantee network security within a reasonable number of enforcement network nodes, without introducing many extra rules.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2502402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362256","Middlebox policy enforcement;policy space analysis;software-defined network","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Middleboxes;Routing;Security","","","","","","","","2015-12-22","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

WSN are harmed or damaged by the Denial of Service (DoS) attack which destroy the network, resources and lose its energy rapidly. Various IDS used to detect malicious node in the network but they consume more energy to monitor malicious node, so decrease the network lifetime and throughput. It is important to form an energy efficient IDS which detect intruder accurately and consume less energy. In this paper, EEIDS (Energy Efficient Intrusion Detection Scheme) is proposed and designed, which detect malicious node based on energy consumption of nodes by comparing actual and predicted energy. The node with abnormal energy detected as malicious node. In EEIDS, Bayesian approach is used for energy prediction of sensor nodes, in which energy consumption of each sensor node is predicted using prior information and likelihood function also energy efficient approach used to reduce energy consumption of network.

As network security has become a growing concern, system administrators lock down their networks by blocking traffic through certain ports and allowing traffic via only selected authorized ports such as HTTP. A recent survey has indicated that around 80 percent of attacks originate in the application layer. In this paper, a framework has been proposed to detect complex application level attacks that easily eludes packet level inspection solution. The proposed method enhances detection capability by performing application-level protocol analysis using semantic classification tree technique. The protocol analysis method extracts only specific fields of the protocol thereby providing significant search space reduction.

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud.

Valeur","Reliable Software Group, California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources.

TTM detects wormhole attacks during route setup procedure by computing transmission time between every two successive nodes along the established path.

We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

The need for such matching arises from two independent trends. First, the volume and share of compressed HTTP traffic is constantly increasing. Second, due to their superior expressibility, current Deep Packet Inspection engines use regular expressions more and more frequently. We present an algorithmic framework to accelerate such matching, taking advantage of information gathered when the traffic was initially compressed. HTTP compression is typically performed through the GZIP protocol, which uses back-references to repeated strings. Our algorithm is based on calculating (for every byte) the minimum number of (previous) bytes that can be part of a future regular expression matching. When inspecting a back-reference, only these bytes should be taken into account, thus enabling one to skip repeated strings almost entirely without missing a match. We show that our generic framework works with either NFA-based or DFA-based implementations and gains performance boosts of more than 70%. Moreover, it can be readily adapted to most existing regular expression matching algorithms, which usually are based either on NFA, DFA or combinations of the two. Finally, we discuss other applications in which calculating the number of relevant bytes becomes handy, even when the traffic is not compressed.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218421","","Acceleration;Automata;Computers;Conferences;Estimation;Inspection;Pattern matching","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;hypermedia;pattern matching;transport protocols","DFA-based implementation;GZIP protocol;NFA-based implementation;compressed HTTP traffic;deterministic finite automata;hypertext transfer protocol;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks.

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV.

In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions.

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1;9781457711251","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA. It means that CDFA may be a more proper model for multi-pattern matching than other FAs.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4577-0637-0;9781457706370","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005927","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Pattern matching;Registers","optimisation;pattern matching;telecommunication security","CDFA;DFA based algorithms;Snort pattern set;high speed network;isomorphic path combination;memory usage;multipattern expression matching;network security;optimization;packet inspection;pattern sets","","0","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers. In addition, based on real data run in POWER WORLD for IEEE benchmark power systems, and through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that BLITHE outperforms the state of arts for detecting abnormal behaviors in pervasive smart grid applications.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2459049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163500","Insider threat detection;security;smart grid","Cryptography;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Power measurement;Smart grids;State estimation","IEEE standards;load flow;power system security;power system state estimation;smart power grids;statistical analysis","BLITHE;DC power flow model;IEEE benchmark power system;POWER WORLD;abnormal behavior detection;behavior rule-based insider threat detection;behavior specification;compliance-distance-based grading strategy;data monitor device;rule-weight grading strategy;smart grid;state estimation model;statistical property","","0","","48","","2015-07-21","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.","1066-6192;10666192","978-1-4673-0226-5;9781467302265","","10.1109/PDP.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557","","Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches","IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing","HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path","","1","","14","","","15-17 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they introduce new risks by allowing attacks on shared resources such as the file system, network and kernel. Existing security hardening mechanisms protect specific applications and are not designed to protect entire environments as those inside the containers. To address these, we present a LiCShield framework for securing of linux containers and their workloads via automatic construction of rules describing the expected activities of containers spawned from a given image. Specifically, given an image of interest LiCShield traces its execution and generates profiles of kernel security modules restricting the containers' capabilities. We distinguish between the operations on the linux host and the ones inside the container to provide the following protection mechanisms: (1) Increased host protection, by restricting the operations done by containers and container management daemon only to those observed in a testing environment; (2) Narrow container operations, by tightening the internal dynamic and noisy environments, without paying the high performance overhead of their on-line monitoring. Our experimental results show that this approach is efficient to prevent known attacks, while having almost no overhead on the production environment. We present our methodology and its technological insights and provide recommendations regarding its efficient deployment with intrusion detection tools to achieve both optimized performance and increased protection.

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic. We also extend the V-HashMem architecture to include a header-ID field and support header matching information, a feature missing both from our own earlier work and many related systems.","1946-147X;1946147X","1-4244-0312-X;142440312X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101006","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","CRC functions;FPGA;Snort-like intrusion detection;comparators;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;single memory structure;variable-length Hashmem architecture","","3","","16","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7;9781424409747","978-1-4244-0975-4;9781424409754","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857;10609857","0-7695-2995-X;076952995X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Extensible Environment for Evaluating Secure MANET","Yongguang Zhang; Yi-an Huang; Wenke Lee","HRL Laboratories, LLC","First International Conference on Security and Privacy for Emerging Areas in Communications Networks (SECURECOMM'05)","20060320","2005","","","339","352","Developing and evaluating secure MANET (mobile adhoc networks) in real systems is a complex process that involves careful design of attack test cases and security countermeasures, as well as meaningful performance measurements to evaluate both the impact of attacks and the performance of security solutions. It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET.","","0-7695-2369-2;0769523692","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607590","","Atomic layer deposition;Automatic testing;Emulation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;System testing;Wireless networks","","","","2","","16","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we focus on the best relay selection and the optimization of the Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) at the relays, aiming at the throughput maximization of the network. Existing literature optimizes PNC with respect to the maximization of the minimum rate among users. The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing non-symmetric rates, while the optimal solution is explored with the aid of the Pareto frontier. The problem of relay selection is matched to a coalition formation game, where the relays and the CD cooperate to maximize their profit. Efficient coalition formation algorithms are proposed, which perform joint relay selection and PNC optimization. Simulation results show that a considerable improvement is achieved compared to existing results, both in terms of the network sum rate and the players' profits.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2405547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045583","Cloud Base Stations;Cloud Radio Access Networks;Cloud radio access networks;Compute-and-Forward;Cooperative Game Theory;Physical Layer Network Coding;Relay Selection;cloud base stations;compute-and-forward;cooperative game theory;physical layer network coding;relay selection","Equations;Games;Network coding;Optimization;Relays;Vectors;Wireless communication","Pareto optimisation;cloud computing;decoding;game theory;network coding;receiving antennas;relay networks (telecommunication)","CD;L antennas/relays;Pareto frontier;centralized decoder;cloud compute-and-forward;cloud network;coalition formation game;compute-and-forward protocol;decode integer equations;distributed receiving antennas;maximization;physical layer network coding;relay cooperation;relay selection;transmitted messages","","2","","32","","2015-02-19","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Each trust management scheme deals with the concept of trust and its evaluation in a unique manner. This uniqueness in approach is achieved by using network parameters, QoS, behavior of nodes etc. as metrics to evaluate trust. Every trust management scheme aims at providing resilience to the effect of malicious or selfish nodes. In this paper, we propose a node memory based trust evaluation method by using memory integrity as a metric to evaluate trust.

We improve such backtracking techniques by logging certain additional parameters of the file system during normal operations (real-time) and examining the logged information during the analysis phase. In addition, we use dataflow analysis within the processes related to the intrusion to prune unwanted paths from the dependency graph.

Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-1456-7;9781424414567","978-1-4244-1457-4;9781424414574","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud.

However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-5175-3;9781424451753","978-1-4244-5176-0;9781424451760","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues.

In this paper we describe a new protocol, named SAVE, that can provide routers with the information needed for source address validation. SAVE messages propagate valid source address information from the source location to all destinations, allowing each router along the way to build an incoming table that associates each incoming interface of the router with a set of valid source address blocks. This paper presents the protocol design and evaluates its correctness and performance by simulation experiments. The paper also discusses the issues of protocol security, the effectiveness of partial SAVE deployment, and the handling of unconventional forms of network routing, such as mobile IP and tunneling.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019407","","Computer crime;Debugging;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Internet;Position measurement;Routing protocols;Traffic control;Tunneling","","","","36","2","24","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision. Furthermore, we also analyze the attack-resistant properties of our key revocation scheme through extensive simulations in the presence of adversaries.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4244-2412-2;9781424424122","978-1-4244-2413-9;9781424424139","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664309","","Analytical models;Bayesian methods;Identity-based encryption;Information analysis;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Packaging;Peer to peer computing;Public key;Public key cryptography","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio","Dirichlet multinomial model;attack-resistant properties;identity-based cryptography;key revocation;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;multilevel response;self-organized key revocation scheme","","0","2","22","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0;9781424446780","978-0-7695-3760-3;9780769537603","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","4","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods. The paper also presents two case scenarios, particularly highlighting the victim Silent case scenario not discussed much thus far in the current literature on the topic, to validate the results.

An entirely new class of emerging network attacks aims at the data plane of the network. Data plane forwarding in network routers has traditionally been implemented with custom-logic hardware, but recent router designs increasingly use software-programmable network processors for packet forwarding. These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","7","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4799-0453-2;9781479904532","978-1-4799-0452-5;9781479904525","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant.

Moreover, it uses only local information thereby ensuring scalability. Our light-weight IDS takes care of two kinds of attacks, namely, the blackhole attack and the grey hole attack.

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.","","978-1-4244-7530-8;9781424475308","","10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840","SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware","Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","message authentication","IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication","","1","","16","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Health Informatics - Point-Of-Care Medical Device Communication - Technical Report - Guidelines for the Use of RF Wireless Technology","","","IEEE Unapproved Draft Std P11073-00101/D03, Sep 2007","20080509","2008","","","","","The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073- 0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519427","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed.

In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets.

Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4;9781479968954","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","1","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Component failure and malicious attack of cyber system could trigger outage, and sometimes, catastrophic blackout in powers system. Previous research shows that self-organized criticality of blackout arise from cascade overload and cascade outage. Whereas, recently observation show the other factors, including malicious sabotage, could contribute to SOC of blackout along without cascade outage. Stuxnet worm, as a new paradigm of malicious software that can spread in the physical isolated network, could initiate coordinated attack and result in ultra large blackout than expected. The cyber security issues of power system should be revisited correspondingly.","","","","10.1049/cp.2011.0520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162262","Cyber attack;SCADA;blackout;coordinated attack;styuxnet worm","","SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system reliability;power system security;security of data","ICT;Information and Communication Technology;component failure;cyber attack impact;malicious attack;malicious sabotage;malicious software;physical isolated network;power system blackout","","4","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"
