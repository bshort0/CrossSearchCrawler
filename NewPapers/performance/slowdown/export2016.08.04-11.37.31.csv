This renders the fixing of these potential faults slow and expensive. This paper proposes a system which can analyse data received from a surveillance system. The proposed system will report abnormal activities, such as malfunctioning or dead sensors, abnormal usage, and abnormal events created by the surveillance system. The experimental evaluation is performed by using six cases describing different types of abnormal activity.

In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module.

Although the problem has received some attention from the research community, little is known about the tradeoffs among different objectives, e.g. network performance, power consumption, delay in information being collected and security effectiveness. This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4577-0637-0;9781457706370","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed detection engine is deployed at each node and performs detection using a set of specifications, which describe the correct operation of the MAC protocol operating at the host node. The proposed engine introduces a number of significant advantages since it can effectively detect both known and unknown attacks in real time and with minimum overhead.

However, the security and privacy is a major hurdle in its success because of its open and distributed architecture that is vulnerable to intruders. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most commonly used mechanism to detect attacks on cloud. This paper provides an overview of different intrusions in cloud. Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to evaluate whether they fulfill the security requirements of cloud computing environment or not.

In deep packet inspection, the contents of network traffic are matched against patterns of malicious traffic to identify attack-carrying packets. The pattern matching algorithms employed for deep packet inspection must be fast, as the algorithms are often implemented on middle-boxes residing on high-speed gigabits per second links. The majority of patterns employed in network security applications are regular languages. However, regular language-based patterns have limited expressive power and are not capable of describing some complex features in network payload. Back reference is an important feature provided by many pattern matching tools, e.g., PCRE, the regular expression libraries of Java, Perl, and Python. Back references are used to identify repeated patterns in input strings. Patterns containing back-references are non-regular languages. Very little work has been done to improve the time-efficiency of back reference-based pattern matching. The de facto algorithm to implement back reference is recursive backtracking, but it is vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement back references. The basic idea of our approach is to transform a back reference problem to a conditional submatch problem, and represent it with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)-like machine subject to some constraints. Our experimental results show that our approach resists known algorithmic complexity attacks, and is faster than PCRE by up to three orders of magnitude for certain types of patterns.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410264","Back reference;Finite automaton;Network-based Intrusion Detection System;Pattern matching","Resists","finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;security of data","NFA-like machine;back reference-based pattern matching algorithm;conditional submatch problem;de facto algorithm;firewalls;modern network security applications;network-based intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automata like machine;recursive backtracking;regular language-based patterns","","","","28","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4;9781424492114","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided.

One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users’ private lives.

This paper presents the design and implementation of VAOFS, a Verifiable Append-Only File System for regulatory compliance. Verifiability is provided by a tamper resistant hardware device cooperating with an instrumented file system. Non-appending operations can be detected in an audit process.

Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policy engine is able to accurately distinguish between legitimate traffic and malware bearing traffic.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688003","","Encryption;Engines;Entropy;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","metering;power meters;power system security;protocols","AMI application layer;AMI control traffic;AMI protocol;advanced metering infrastructure;data payloads;deep packet inspection;malware propagation;multistage analysis;policy engine","","2","","25","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

Also, employees might work at many different locations. In the enterprise patch management (PM) market today, there are very few complete off-the-shelf solutions.

Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and may act freely as web clients or servers. Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT. The partial evaluation results show that the proposed protocol, named compressed and distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is more adapted than the standard HIP, while introducing minor header communication overhead.","2327-6525;23276525","978-1-4799-6608-0;9781479966080","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990267","6LoWPAN compression;Host Identity Protocol;Internet of Tinhgs;IoT;Wireless Sensor Networks;distributed HIP Base Exchange;end-to-end security","Hip;IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;file servers;personal area networks;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN;CD-HIP;IP-based security protocols;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;Web clients;Web servers;communication overhead;compressed and distributed HIP;computational-load distribution techniques;distribution scheme;end-to-end security;host identity protocol;messages compression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a lightweight and scalable key management scheme for heterogeneous sensor networks is proposed. The scheme is based on Exclusion Basis System (EBS) for scalability and simple symmetric cryptographic primitives with low computational requirements. It provides periodic or on demand key refreshment and node authentication to improve the security of the network. In addition, it is highly efficient in terms of key refreshment and node revocation.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0;9781424472710","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
