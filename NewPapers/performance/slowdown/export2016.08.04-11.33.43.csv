It runs a target system in a virtual machine (VM) and enables IDSes to monitor the VM from the outside using VM introspection. Although VM introspection is well studied, its performance has not been reported in detail. The performance becomes important when users choose virtualization software, e.g., Xen and KVM. However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen. Even for legacy chkrootkit, the execution time with KVMonitor was 63% shorter than that in Xen.","","978-1-4799-6473-4;9781479964734","","10.1109/PRDC.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974789","IDS offloading;intrusion detection systems;security;virtual machine introspection;virtualization software","Kernel;Monitoring;Registers;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","IDS offloading;KVM software;KVMonitor;Transcall;VM introspection;Xen software;intrusion detection system;legacy chkrootkit;memory introspection;virtual machines","","0","","39","","","18-21 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Multigrade security monitoring for ad-hoc wireless networks","M. T. Creti; M. Beaman; S. Bagchi; Zhiyuan Li; Yung-Hsiang Lu","","2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","20091117","2009","","","342","352","Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-8178-1;9781424481781","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","Application software;Availability;Computer architecture;Information systems;Internet;Open systems;Protection;Resilience;Service oriented architecture;Web server","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","13","","27","","2008-02-02","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, routing protocols improvement is a challenge for researchers to overcome the negative effects of security measures. Clustering the MANET is a known technique to lower the routing over-head. It can also be utilized to distribute encryption keys and the authentication process. In this paper, a new protocol called Secure Clustering and Energy Saver Protocol “SCESP” is proposed. SCESP secures the Mobile Ad hoc Networks and increase its network lifetime.

In addition, it eliminates the key distribution overhead using smart token or similar hardware which is used for authentication.

Due to the de-centralized infrastructure, MANET becomes vulnerable to both passive and active attacks. To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement. Here the key encryption is done at every node to increase the performances against contemporary approaches. It also provides highest malicious behaviour detection rate which does not affect the significant performances of the network.","","978-1-4799-2321-2;9781479923212","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892809","AACK;Digital Signature Algorithm;IKGM;Intrusion Detection System","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Throughput","cryptography;digital signatures;mobile ad hoc networks;personal area networks;telecommunication security","IDS;IKGM;MANET security;PAN;Watchdog mechanism;battle field relief;crisis management;hybrid cryptography;instant key generation mechanism;intrusion detection system;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc network;network overhead;personal area networking;remote explorations","","2","","10","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses some principles implemented in the Testbed design including the architecture, accessibility, security, and visualization. The Testbed provides effective ways to collect data representing the network and software operation. It facilitates secure time sharing of the hardware among different research projects. Its enhanced security is achieved by separation and hardening of the core services. The application of the Testbed is demonstrated by the following three experiments featuring novel IDS technologies: behavior-based IDS extracting predefined malicious functionalities from the system call data by semantic analysis, demonstration of the alarm propagation concept for the minimization of false alarms and the detection of distributed low and slow attacks, and network-wide IDS capable of automatic detection of functionalities and statistically significant variations of their relative frequencies indicative of information attacks.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4673-0079-7;9781467300797","","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127454","Testbed;intrusion detection;security research;software behavior;system calls","Educational institutions;Hardware;Internet;Malware;Servers;Software","computer forensics;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;invasive software;minimisation","Binghamton University;alarm propagation concept;behavior-based IDS;computer forensics system;computer network testbed design;data represention;false alarm minimization;information attacks;intrusion detection;network-wide IDS;secure time sharing;security research;self-propagating malware;semantic analysis","","0","","15","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2;9781424427772","978-1-4244-2778-9;9781424427789","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","23","3","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs.

The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed.

Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC","2008 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","20081021","2008","","","608","612","One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.","2160-4886;21604886","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","10.1109/WiMob.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307","Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election","Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security","Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption","","2","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, Linux 2.6 includes the Linux security modules (LSM) framework that enables the enforcement of MAC policies (e.g., type enforcement or multi-level security) for individual systems. While this is a start, we envision that MAC enforcement should span multiple machines. The goal is to be able to control interaction between applications on different machines based on MAC policy. In this paper, we describe a recent extension of the LSM framework that enables labeled network communication via IPsec that is now available in mainline Linux as of version 2.6.16. This functionality enables machines to control communication with processes on other machines based on the security label assigned to an IPsec security association. We outline a security architecture based on labeled IPsec to enable distributed MAC authorization. In particular, we examine the construction of a xinetd service that uses labeled IPsec to limit client access on Linux 2.6.16 systems. We also discuss the application of labeled IPsec to distributed storage and virtual machine access control","","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198790","","Access control;Authorization;Communication system control;Communication system security;Control systems;Grid computing;Kernel;Linux;Permission;Sockets","IP networks;Linux;access protocols;authorisation;telecommunication control;virtual machines","IPsec security association;Linux 2.6.16;Linux security modules framework;distributed MAC authorization;distributed storage;labeled network communication;mandatory per-packet access control;multi-level security;type enforcement;virtual machine access control;xinetd service","","0","","26","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","2","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to various attacks.

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these needs are traditionally provided through methods of channel encryption and signing, such mechanisms are often difficult or impossible to implement in the ad-hoc, decentralized environments seen in sensor networks, collaborative intrusion detection systems, or other similar peer-to-peer networks. Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message. Although our proposed mechanisms are likely implemented without difficulty from a network and encryption standpoint, they do require significant integration and awareness within the applications relying on them. The method also assumes a static value from a large existing set of shared knowledge, which does not always exist.","","978-1-4577-0980-7;9781457709807","978-0-7695-4459-5;9780769544595","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032224","hashing;secure communications;shared knowledge","Ad hoc networks;Complexity theory;Encryption;Knowledge engineering;Receivers","ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","ad-hoc communication;ad-hoc environment;ad-hoc security;channel encryption;channel signing;collaborative intrusion detection system;complexity hash function;decentralized communication network;language-derived relevance theory;message complexity;message confidentiality;message integrity;message-based communication network;one-way cryptographic hashing mechanism;one-way hashing;peer-to-peer network;salted hash;secure communication;sensor network","","1","","29","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets.

First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs.

This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612","","Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network","","11","","26","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner.

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6;0780397886","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases. Our techniques can be applied to database systems to provide multizone isolations with different levels of QoS.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412980","","Application software;Computer science;Computer security;Database systems;Delay;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","SQL;data integrity;quality of service;query processing;security of data;transaction processing","SQL injections;SQL queries;data corruption attacks;database filtering;database isolation;database system transactions;integrity level;intrusion detections systems;quality of service;recovery cost reduction;sequential analysis;uniform processing latency;unsafe zone","","1","","18","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of popular anti-virus applications relies on the pattern matching algorithms implemented in these security devices. The growth of network bandwidth and the increase of virus signatures call for high speed and scalable pattern matching algorithms. Motivated by several observations of a real-life virus signature database from Clam-AV, a popular antivirus application, a fast pattern matching algorithm named MRSI is proposed in this paper.

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications. The simulation shows that the throughput of scanning Windows executable files for more than 10000 virus signatures can achieve 5.64 Gb/s, while the worst-case performance is 1.2 Gb/s if the signatures are properly specified.","1063-8210;10638210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2012011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840440","Algorithms;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);string matching","","C language;digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;logic design;program verification;string matching","Bloom filter;C language;HDL;algorithmic heuristics;antivirus application;bad-block heuristic;behavior simulation;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerator;linear worst-case time method;network security;nonblocking interface;parallel query;sublinear time string-matching algorithm;timing simulation;verification module;virus signature","","5","","39","","2009-04-24","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The research presented in this paper simplifies the integration of trusted platform module based integrity measurement into commodity cloud infrastructure by eliminating the need for “custom” software and patches; it also enhances instance-level security by including a distributed file and directory integrity checker for added security. The deployment of trusted cloud computing using the Eucalyptus Cloud software on server-grade hardware is discussed, as well as the results of a comparative evaluation of the additional overhead in instance creation/start-up based on a simulation of low, medium and high security settings.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890520","Security requirements engineering;decision documentation;decision knowledge;heuristic analysis;knowledge carrying software;software evolution;user mon-itoring","Context;Documentation;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring;Security;Software","formal specification;security of data;system documentation","end user monitoring;heuristic analysis;heuristic assessment method;organization;security decision documentation;security decisions;security issues;security knowledge;semiautomatic security requirements engineering;software engineers;software evolution;vulnerability","","0","","18","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8;9781457717048","978-1-4577-1702-4;9781457717024","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","15","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;game theory-based energy-theft detection;security vulnerabilities;smart grid proliferation;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;utility companies","","9","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, biologically inspired algorithms are reviewed and enhanced to tackle problems arise in WSN. Ant routing and human security has shown an excellent performance for sensor networks. Certain parameters like energy level, link quality, lose rate are considered while making decisions. These decisions will come up with the optimal route and also to take best action against the security attacks.

Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space. The whole unused addresses in the organization are virtually watched by a small number of the honeypots installed in a special network under the control. By the aggregation of honeypots, honeypots may be supervised well, and the risk of compromise may be reduced. The surveillance system can be established without making alternation in existing network equipments. It selects the address under surveillance autonomously. It is able to adapt to addition and deletion of networks and hosts without any administration.","","0-7695-2492-3;0769524923","","10.1109/PRDC.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607533","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Electronic mail;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Surveillance;Switches","Internet;surveillance;telecommunication security","Internet security;centralized surveillance;honeypot;unused address space surveillance;virtual networks","","0","1","10","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which detection data is acquired at the leaves and is incrementally aggregated, reduced, and analyzed as it flows upward toward the root. Security management directives flow downward from nodes at the top. To maintain communications efficiency, the hierarchy is automatically reconfigured as needed using clustering techniques in which clusterheads are selected based on topology and other criteria.

Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445;17389445","978-1-4673-0150-3;9781467301503","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead.

However, in the presence of attackers, reliable and trustworthy operations in such networks become impossible without securing routing protocols. In this paper, we target to study and design a secure routing protocol S-GyTAR for vehicular environments. Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator. Simulation results show high performances regarding the detection rate of malicious nodes and overhead with an amelioration of the end-to-end communication delay in the presence of malicious vehicles.","1930-529X;1930529X","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036788","Clustering;Monitoring;Reputation;Routing;Security;VANET","Ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Roads;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","routing protocols;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","NS3 simulator;S-GyTAR;VANET;data collection;data routing;distributed trust management strategy;greedy forwarding technique;secure intersection-based routing protocol;urban vehicular networks","","0","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After logging is finished, it returns to the guest operating system running in the more privileged level and starts the system call.

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality.

This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems which are based on open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access.","0018-9219;00189219","","","10.1109/JPROC.2005.849714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1435744","Cryptography;embedded systems;industrial automation;industrial communication systems;remote access;security objectives;security protocols;security standards","Access control;Access protocols;Automation;Communication industry;Communication networks;Communication system security;Cryptographic protocols;Electrical equipment industry;Electronic countermeasures;IP networks","Internet;cryptography;message authentication;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IT security;Internet;TCP-IP protocol;access control;cryptography;data authentication;electronic attacks;embedded system;industrial automation system;industrial communication network;industrial communication system;mission critical operation;open communication system;open protocols;remote access;safety critical operation;secure communication protocols;security protocol;security standard;standardized automation protocol;user authentication","","110","26","140","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
