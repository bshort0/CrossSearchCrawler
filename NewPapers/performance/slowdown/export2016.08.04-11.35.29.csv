At the same time, it suffers from some security shortcomings, because of the malicious hosts have the possibility of poisoning the ARP cache for another host on the same LAN. In this paper, by gratuitous ARP request packets, we propose a solution to the problem of ARP poisoning. Our suggested mechanism which is named a Gratuitous Decision Packet System (GDPS) seeks to achieve two main goals: (1) Detection of suspicious ARP packets, by implementing a real-time analyzing for received ARP packets. (2) The distinction between a legitimate and malicious host through sending a modified request packet of the gratuitous ARP packets. Furthermore, the experiments show that the presented design has the efficiency and accuracy, as well as it does not require any additional software or hardware.","","978-1-4673-2630-8;9781467326308","","10.1109/DCABES.2012.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385293","ARP Cash Poisoning;Man In The Middle attack;Network Security","Economic indicators;IP networks;Local area networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Unicast","access protocols;computer network security;local area networks;transport protocols","ARP poisoning problem;ARP request packets;ARP spoofing attack prevention;Ethernet topology;IP address mapping;LAN;MAC address;address resolution protocol;gratuitous decision packet system","","0","","21","","","19-22 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography). Resulting replicated systems that exhibit nondeterministic behavior, which cannot be handled with conventional replication approaches.

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4799-3629-8;9781479936298","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.","","","","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380646","Overload Control;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);kamailio;server","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Floods;Internet telephony;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;quality of service;resource allocation;signalling protocols","DDoS attack detection;DDoS attack mitigation;Hellinger distance;QoS;SIP load balancer;SIP-based voice over IP network;VOIP network security;distributed denial of service attack;open source kamailio SIP proxy server;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers.

Now-a-days intrusion detection systems have become a standard component in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. And practically all of them require some kind of termination in network connections. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present PIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces most of the problems contained by the previous systems and it doesnpsilat need to terminate any network connections to detect the intruder. This system generates quick responses against intrusions and stops the intruder to proceed for further attacks.","","978-0-7695-3595-1;9780769535951","","10.1109/ICIME.2009.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077011","Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;Network Connection Termination;Packet Behavior;Trust Issue","Centralized control;Computer science;Control systems;Humans;Information management;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Real time systems","computer networks;security of data","PIDS;computer networks;global connectivity;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection;network intrusion prevention;network security","","1","","10","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IoT uses the Internet as a key infrastructure to interconnect numerous geographically diversified IoT nodes which usually have scare resources, and therefore cloud is used as a key back-end supporting infrastructure. In the literature, the collection of the IoT nodes and the cloud is collectively called as an IoT cloud. Unfortunately, the IoT cloud suffers from various drawbacks such as huge network latency as the volume of data which is being processed within the system increases. To alleviate this issue, the concept of fog computing is introduced, in which foglike intermediate computing buffers are located between the IoT nodes and the cloud infrastructure to locally process a significant amount of regional data. Compared to the original IoT cloud, the communication latency as well as the overhead at the backend cloud infrastructure could be significantly reduced in the fog computing supported IoT cloud, which we will refer as IoT fog. Consequently, several valuable services, which were difficult to be delivered by the traditional IoT cloud, can be effectively offered by the IoT fog. In this paper, however, we argue that the adoption of IoT fog introduces several unique security threats. We first discuss the concept of the IoT fog as well as the existing security measures, which might be useful to secure IoT fog. Then, we explore potential threats to IoT fog.","","","","10.1109/NOF.2015.7333287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7333287","","Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Internet of things;Privacy;Real-time systems;Security;Sensors","Internet of Things;cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","Internet of Things environment;IoT cloud;IoT fog;IoT nodes;back-end cloud infrastructure;back-end supporting infrastructure;cloud infrastructure;communication latency;fog computing;network latency;privacy issues;security issues;security threats","","","","6","","","Sept. 30 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a design and implementation of parallel firewall architecture that is able to handle packets for high-speed network. The implementation utilizes arrays of Linux-based firewall under data parallel scheme running incorporate with specific ASIC switch. The load balancing mechanism, using hashing of disjoint subset, distributes the traffic among a configurable number of parallel machines, providing high performance with reliability, flexibility, and scalability.

A Polynomial-based Compromise-Resilient En-route Filtering plan (PCREF) is proposed to channel the false information infused in the middle hub. PCREF utilizes two sorts of polynomial which has been gotten from the primitive polynomial: Check Polynomial and Authentication Polynomial. PCREF uses hybrid connection instead of forwarder node used in CPNS. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) techniques are used to assign keys for each and every node in the network. It has public and private keys. Each node in the network has its own ID and it plays a vital role in sharing information with the sink node.

Therefore, in this paper an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed to identify the occurrence of the malicious behavior and to notify the system operator about one specific type of electromagnetic interference in RFID systems - the Jamming attack.

Using the Trapdoor Chameleon Hash Function, the smart meters can periodically send an evidence to the utility back-end, by computing an alternative message and a random value (m', r) such that m' consists of all previous energy usage measurements of the smart meter in a specified period of time. By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters.

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","1","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7;9781424400027","978-1-4244-0003-4;9781424400034","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, securing IoT technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection for low-resource IoT devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e. high detection and low false positive rates).","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510811","Anomaly detection;Game theory;Low-resources devices;Nash equilibrium","Energy consumption;Games;Handwriting recognition;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cryptography;digital signatures;energy consumption;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;attack confirmation;attack pattern detection;cryptography;energy consumption;game-theoretic methodology;intrusion detection system;learning algorithm;lightweight anomaly detection technique;low-resource IoT devices;signature detection","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","7","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus in this summary is on the compression part of the DMBS system for intrusion detection. We present a methodology employing grammar-based and large alphabet compression techniques which involves the generation of multiple dictionaries for compressing clustered subfiles of a very large data file. One of the dictionaries is a common dictionary which models features common to the subfiles. In addition, non-common features of each subfile are modeled via an auxiliary dictionary.

The major factor to be tackle in WSN the network lifetime and that actually depends on the efficiency of the routing protocol. A novel Biological Inspired Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol (BIOSARP) enhances Secure Real Time Load Distribution (SRTLD) with self-optimized routing mechanism that reduces neighbor discovery process at every hop.

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2848-1;0769528481","","10.1109/SP.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes","data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels","attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats","","16","","18","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While intrusion event correlation and attack scenario construction have been previously studied, this is the first treatment based on association with network attack graphs. We handle missed detections through the analysis of network vulnerability dependencies, unlike previous approaches that infer hypothetical attacks. In particular, we quantify lack of knowledge through attack graph distance. We show that low-pass signal filtering of event correlation sequences improves results in the face of erroneous detections. We also show how a correlation threshold can be applied for creating strongly correlated attack scenarios. Our model is highly efficient, with attack graphs and their exploit distances being computed offline. Online event processing requires only a database lookup and a small number of arithmetic operations, making the approach feasible for real-time applications.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377242","","Aggregates;Arithmetic;Context modeling;Databases;Event detection;Face detection;Filtering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters","computer network management;correlation theory;low-pass filters;security of data","arithmetic operation;attack scenario construction;intrusion event correlation;low-pass signal filtering;network attack graph;online event processing","","30","2","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","1","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

Because transportation infrastructure may be unusable, aerial assessments are the gold standard by which such assessments are performed. The advent of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and autonomous aircraft represents a unique opportunity to allow for rapid response, while minimizing the cost of deployment and increasing reliability and operator safety. This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft. By understanding both the application context and the resource availability, networked aircraft can reorganize to ensure resiliency for the mission if a resource failure occurs within the network.","","978-1-4673-5287-1;9781467352871","978-1-4673-5286-4;9781467352864","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504199","Energy efficiency;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Robust and secure wireless communication;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft;Aircraft navigation;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","aircraft communication;cost reduction;disasters;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET aerial communication;aerial assessment performance;aerial sensing performance;autonomous aircraft deployment;cost minimization;data collection;fault-tolerant;group navigation;mobile ad-hoc network;natural disaster;operational reliability;operator safety;radio receiver;real-time processing power;resource availability;resource failure network;search-rescue application;security;transportation infrastructure;wireless communication","","5","","23","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, VANETs have some characteristics that make them more vulnerable to potential attacks when compared to other networks such as wired networks. The characteristics of VANETs are: an open medium, no traditional security infrastructure, high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, we build an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) for VANETs that uses a Proportional Overlapping Scores (POS) method to reduce the number of features that are extracted from the trace file of VANET behavior and used for classification.

In this paper, we present a survey of the main types of attack at the network layer, and we then review intrusion detection and protection mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. We classify these mechanisms as either point detection algorithms that deal with a single type of attack, or as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that can deal with a range of attacks.

On the other hand, it also lends itself to distributed methods for efficient enforcement of spectrum etiquette. We leverage a crowd of mobile users to implement a paradigm of “eye-witness” for detecting violations of spectrum policies.

At the same time, Web applications tend to be error prone and implementation vulnerabilities are readily and commonly exploited by attackers. The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application. We show that the annotation overhead is very small, that the performance of the fully automatic static verification is acceptable, and that the performance overhead of the runtime checking is limited.","0098-5589;00985589","","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359468","Data sharing;Reliability;Security;Security and Protection;Software/Program Verification;Web technologies;Web-based services","","Web services;programming languages","J2EE-based e-commerce application;JML annotation language;Web application vulnerabilities;provable protection;security engineering;session data dependencies;software engineering","","2","1","48","","","Jan.-Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

There is no centralized network. There are various attacks for which defend mechanism have been proposed by many researchers. Out of all such attacks wormhole attack poses a great threat as it has ability to grab the route more easily and is difficult to prevent. This paper basically focuses on wormhole attack and proposes an efficient detection and prevention method for this type of attack in AODV protocol using trust based mechanism. The method uses multi-paths for the path discovery process and thus provides greater path selection. The proposed method works by observing the routing path and the path that exceeds the threshold value are considered as wormhole link and the nodes on that link are identified as wormhole nodes. After detection of wormhole attack, for sending data packet from source to destination node we prefer multiple paths by which efficiency of network increases and packet delay as well as packet drop minimizes to great extent. Thus improves the Quality of Service of AODV protocol against wormhole attack.","","978-1-4673-6790-5;9781467367905","","10.1109/ICSCTI.2015.7489559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489559","AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector);MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Networks);Multi-path routing;Trust Based System;Wormhole Attack","Cryptography;Law;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;TV","mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV protocol;MANET infrastructure;base station;data packet sending;detection and prevention method;multipath routing method;packet delay;packet drop;path discovery process;path selection;quality of service improvement;routing path;source to destination node;trust based system;wormhole attack;wormhole link","","","","27","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a learning algorithm to decide when to broadcast the warning message.","","0-7803-7974-8;0780379748","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258460","","Authentication;Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Computer crime;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Terrorism","IP networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","abnormal traffic;distributed denial of service attack;incoming packets;learning algorithm;potential reflector;reflector attacks detection;sharing beliefs;warning message","","1","","17","","","1-5 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata","Y. H. E. Yang; V. K. Prasanna","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electrical Eng., University of Southern California, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE","20110630","2011","","","1853","1861","Regular expression matching (REM) with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) can be computationally expensive when a large number of patterns are matched concurrently. On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","13","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides flexible and low cost services to the users, which make it more popular than the existing Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN). With the popularity of this technology, it became targeted victim of different attacks. In this paper we analyzed VoIP architecture, both theoretically and practically with more emphasizes on security of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In order to analyze theoretically, we performed a literature survey related to SIP security and classified it in term of existing SIP attacks and defenses. Our theoretical analysis reveals that most attacks on VoIP architecture were successful due to weaknesses of SIP, especially the authentication mechanism used in the session establishment phase. For practical analysis, we used open source Asterisk and pen-test it in different attacking scenarios using Kali Linux distribution. Our practical analysis studies revealed that open source asterisk server is still vulnerable to several attacks, which includes eavesdropping, intentional interruption, social threats, interception and modification, and unintentional interruption. We also provide a concise mitigating scheme based on Single Sign-On (SSO), which provides an efficient and reliable authentication mechanism for securing SIP.","","978-1-4799-6088-0;9781479960880","","10.1109/ICET.2014.7021022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021022","Asterisk;PSTN;RTP;SIP;Security;VoIP","Authentication;Cryptography;Internet;Interrupters;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;telecommunication security","Kali Linux distribution;PSTN;SIP;VoIP;authentication mechanism;public switch telephone network;security analysis;session initiation protocol;voice over Internet protocol","","2","","33","","","8-9 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme has been applied to two security protocols known as simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) and efficient mesh security association (EMSA). Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. Finally, by developing a denial of service attack model, we can then evaluate the security of the proposed schemes against cyber attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2277963","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599007","EMSA;IEEE 802.11s;SAE;security attacks;security protocols;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Authentication;Computer crime;Logic gates;Mesh networks;Protocols;Smart grids","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;home networks;smart power grids;substations;trees (mathematics);wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","EMSA;HAN;IEEE 802.11s;Merkle tree 4-way handshaking scheme;NAN;SAE;WLAN;cost-ef- fective communications;cyber attack;denial-of-service attack model;distributed mesh sensor networks;dynamic key distribution strategy updating;efficient mesh security association;home area networks;neighborhood area networks;network performance;network resiliency improvement;plant-generation local area networks;security protocols;simultaneous authentication-of-equals;smart grid mesh network security enhancement;substation local area networks;wireless local area networks","","2","","26","","2013-09-13","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although encryption helps to increase network security level, it is not sufficient to protect against malicious intruders. An intrusion detection scheme is proposed in this paper based on cross layer feature collection from the medium access control (MAC) and network layers. The proposed method employs an hierarchical configuration that avoids using a clustering algorithm and, instead, sequentially activates the promiscuity (ability to sniff all packets transmitted by nodes within radio range) of the node based on its location in the network. The node in this case acts as a pseudo cluster head (PCH) that collects data from its neighboring nodes in each quadrant in the field and then uses this information to calculate an anomaly index (AI) in each quadrant. The mechanism uses a C4.5 decision tree to learn the network behavior under blackhole attack and is able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to 97% accuracy. The presented approach is twofold - it is energy efficient and has a high degree of intrusion detection with low overhead.","","978-1-4673-8450-6;9781467384506","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430139","","Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","access protocols;cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","C4.5 decision tree;MANET;anomaly index;blackhole attack;clustering algorithm;cross layer intrusion detection;hierarchical configuration;intrusion detection scheme;medium access control;mobile ad hoc network;network security level;pseudocluster head;pseudoclustering scheme;wireless network","","","","15","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole. Then the performance of these attacks against the proposed algorithm has been calculated and result is displayed.","","978-0-9893-1933-1;9780989319331","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918258","Adhoc networks;Denial of service;Intrusion;Multitier;Trust;commitment","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","DSR algorithm;application layer data;application tier;data transfer;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;muiltier intrusion detection system;routing policy;routing tier;security attack;trust tier;trusted connection;trusted multitier method","","0","","15","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets. Post-place-and-route results show that when 8 characters are matched per cycle, our design can achieve 180 MHz clock rate, leading to a throughput of 11.8 Gbps.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4577-0831-2;9781457708312","978-1-4577-0832-9;9781457708329","10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6260830","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;context;off-chip memory;packet flow","Context;Pipelines;Random access memory;Switches;Switching circuits;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;logic design","REM;deep packet inspection;frequency 180 MHz;hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism;large-capacity memory;large-scale multiflow regular expression matching;large-size packet;off-chip memory;packet flow;packet processing operation;post-place-and-route;state-of-the-art FPGA device","","2","","13","","","24-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
