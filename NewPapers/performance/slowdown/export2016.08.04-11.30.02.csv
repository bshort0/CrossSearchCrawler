This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting misrouted, corrupted or dropped. In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1;0780381041","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6;9781424475476","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"WinWizard: Expanding Xen with a LibVMI Intrusion Detection Tool","J. Lamps; I. Palmer; R. Sprabery","Comput.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4799-5062-1;9781479950621","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The developed system is applied to different probing attacks. Furthermore, its performance is compared to other neural networks' approaches and the results indicate that our approach is more precise and accurate in case of false positive, false negative and detection rate.","","978-1-4244-4681-0;9781424446810","978-1-4244-4683-4;9781424446834","10.1109/ISIEA.2009.5356382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356382","Dataset;Detection Rate;False Negative;False Positive;Learning;Multiple Layered Perceptron;Neural Network;Probing attack;Remote to User;Resilient Backpropagation;User to root","Adaptive systems;Application software;Artificial neural networks;Backpropagation;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","adaptive security alliance;artificial neural network;computer network systems;cyber attack;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multiple layered perceptron;probing attacks detection;supervised neural network","","2","","27","","","4-6 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context.

The paper analyses the requirements of ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems and presents our approach for an IPS that runs on top of an active networking environment and is automatically configured by a vulnerability scanner. We call the system FIDRAN (Flexible Intrusion Detection and Response framework for Active Networks). The system autonomously analyses the home network and correspondingly configures the IPS. Furthermore, our system detects and adjusts itself to changes in the home network (new service, new host, etc.).

We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment.

This is because existing guidelines, IT standards and laws on security and privacy do not take virtual environments into account. Thus, they present a significant challenge for cloud providers to comply with. As a result, the cloud providers are unable to provide SMEs with an assurance. In order to address these privacy and security issues, this paper presents the Cloud Data Security (CloudDataSec) project that aims to design cloud services adhering to government privacy laws. In particular, this paper introduces a six-layer security model for cloud computing and three level of security assurance for SMEs to take advantage of. Finally, Security Management as a Service (SMaaS) modules, as proposed in this paper, enable users to apply necessary security and privacy operations, based on the sensitivity of their data.","","978-1-4244-7547-6;9781424475476","","10.1109/CIT.2010.172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578475","IT compliance;cloud computing;data security;privacy","Cloud computing;Clouds;Data privacy;Encryption;Monitoring;Privacy","Web services;data privacy;law;security of data;small-to-medium enterprises","IT standards;cloud computing;cloud data security project;cloud services;government privacy laws;on-demand services;pay-per-use basis;security management as a service modules;six-layer security model;small and medium-sized enterprises","","7","","26","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station). In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided.

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","40","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we have implemented S-ACK scheme to transmit the secure acknowledgement. To detect attackers, a trust model is designed. The Forward ant agents transmit back the digitally signed S-ACK through the Backward Ant agent to detect any selective forwarding attack against any source node.

This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454","Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines","VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines","","0","","26","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation.

However, to make a WMN be all it can be, considerable research efforts are still needed. As the available MAC and routing protocols applied to WMNs do not have enough scalability as throughput drops significantly as the number of nodes or hops increases. Existing security schemes may be effective for certain types of attacks, but they lack a comprehensive mechanism to prevent attacks from different protocol layers. Similar problems exist in other networking protocols. Thus, existing communication protocols, ranging from routing, MAC, and physical layers, need to be revisited and enhanced. In some circumstances, new protocols need to be invented. Researchers have started to revisit the protocol design of existing wireless networks. This paper presents a detailed investigation of current research issues and challenges in wireless mesh networks.","","978-1-4244-6079-3;9781424460793","978-1-4244-6080-9;9781424460809","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445840","Cross layer design;MAC protocols;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","Art;Media Access Protocol;Next generation networking;Physical layer;Routing protocols;Scalability;Spine;Throughput;Wireless application protocol;Wireless mesh networks","access protocols;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","MAC;art research issues;communication protocols;networking protocols;next-generation wireless networking;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","","0","","15","","","19-21 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an attack flow traceback scheme which is based on flow digests and network layer data. Digesting flow instead of individual packet would save memory and be more scalable. Storing network layer data makes it possible to identify attacker node itself on the subnet not the ingress point of an attacking packet and reduce a lot of unnecessary queries which used to be originated in traceback process.","","978-0-7695-3407-7;9780769534077","","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682276","","Computer crime;Data structures;High-speed networks;Information technology;Internet;Payloads;Protocols;Routing;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IP packet traceback;attack flow traceback;attack packet;flow digest;network layer data;network routing","","1","","14","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt. For heap overflow vulnerability, we can automatically exploit the unlink() macro of glibc, which formerly requires sophisticated hacking efforts.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717039","Automatic exploit generation;bug forensics;software crash analysis;symbolic execution;taint analysis","Analytical models;Computer crashes;Concrete;Libraries;Registers;Security;Software","computer crime;program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;symbol manipulation","Microsoft office word;S<sup>2</sup>E;archiver;attack generation;automatic exploit generation;binary programs;concolic executions;end-to-end approach;format string;foxit;heap overflows;mapped symbolic memory;media player;mitigation-hardened exploits;mpalyer;pdf reader;pseudo symbolic variables;software crash analysis;software failures;software fuzz testing targets;sophisticated hacking efforts;stack overflows;symbolic failure model;symbolic pointers;unrar;word processor","","1","","30","","2014-01-20","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

During node mobility, there are possibilities for the malicious node to become the cluster head or cluster member. This causes the cluster or the whole network to be controlled by the malicious nodes. To offer high level of security, the mobile sensor nodes need to be authenticated. Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes. In addition, a bidirectional malicious node detection technique is employed which eliminates the malicious node from the network. By simulation, it is proved that the proposed technique provides efficient security with reduced energy consumption during node mobility.","1673-5447;16735447","","","10.1109/CC.2016.7513213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513213","cluster;dynamic key;heterogeneous;mobility;weight;wireless sensor network","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Heuristic algorithms;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","authenticated nodes;average distance;average speed;bidirectional malicious node detection technique;cluster based secure dynamic keying technique;cluster head;cluster member;data delivery;energy efficient routing;heterogeneous mobile wireless sensor networks;node degree;node mobility;sensor nodes;virtual battery power;weight value","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","87","8","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic.

How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This improves network visibility and control thereby reducing vendor dependency. OpenFlow protocol provides a standardized approach to realize these goals of SDN. In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","3","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The processes and systems for business services in cable have traditionally been vertically integrated with specific technologies. Security concerns for network operators include all the same concerns for enterprise networks and many additional challenges. The approach used to provide security for business customers, which differs from residential, is the segregation of business services, even Internet access, into separate IP address ranges and classes of services. Provisioning is the process of making provisions with network and system resources required to provide a service. Perhaps the greatest challenge for OAMPT is not the ongoing addition of new technologies to operate and support, but to maintain backward compatibility with often aging technologies.

In this paper, a novel defense architecture that blocks malicious traffic far from the protected servers is proposed. Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality.

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, these schemes are vulnerable to mark spoofing and altering. To deal with these limitations, we propose in this paper an outbound global marking scheme which uses a novel structure, called mark association, that holds enriched information about the intruder activity either at the network, system or storage level. The proposed scheme enables the monitoring of the intruder activity, the tracking of occurred events, the traceback of the attackers source addresses, in addition to the reconstruction of attack scenarios.

Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9;0769525539","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Todaypsilas network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server.

Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks.

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","47","","2015-03-27","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Connectivity problems make nodes separated by a firewall/NAT unable to communicate with each other. Due to the bidirectional and multi-organizational nature of grids, they are particularly susceptible to connectivity problems. These problems make collaboration difficult or impossible and cause resources to be wasted.

Actually, managing MANETspsila security is a hard challenge due to the inherent complexity and the tremendous number of parameters which should be considered. To provide efficient security management, we focus on three main parameters: the secured device capabilities, the associated network security and the secured applications. The solution we propose, named Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a scalable, flexible and application-oriented framework able to manage security depending on the application requirements and the network security conditions. ASMA is based on a structure called macrograph combining both dynamic trust management and multipath routing. The macrograph structure is capable to estimate transmission security in order to assure that communications are established only when they match applications security requirements. ASMA flexibility offers compliance with most on-demand routing protocols and security tools. In this paper we present simulation results for ASMA associated with AOMDV (a multipath declination of AODV) routing protocol and compare results with AOMDV. We show that ASMA-AOMDV outperforms AOMDV, dividing by three the packet loss rate in networks including 20% of malicious nodes, while causing only 3% of additional loss in safe networks.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575258","","Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;National security;Performance analysis;Resource management;Robustness;Routing protocols;Scalability","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","adaptive secured multipath for ad hoc networks;dynamic MANET;flexible security management solution;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;packet loss rate;routing protocols","","0","","11","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1;9781479915941","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM).
