However, most existing network-based signatures are specific to exploit and can be easily evaded. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on our observation, malicious web pages have uncommon behavior in order to evade from detection of Antivirus software. The anomaly behavior such as code encoding makes malicious web pages different from normal benign web pages. Current researches have noticed pattern-matching approach is not suitable to detect malicious web pages anymore, and then proposes a new detection method. The proposed method, a client-side malicious web page detection method, is based on anomaly behavior analysis.

In this paper, to develop a security framework has been proposed. This security framework involves: detection of malicious nodes by the destination node, isolation of malicious nodes by discarding the path and prevention data packets by using dispersion techniques. We propose to develop a multipath reliable routing (MRR) algorithm, which determines a set of node-disjoint reliable paths. The paths are arranged in the descending order of their reliability index. Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm. Our simulation result shows that, when compared with existing scheme, our framework reduces overhead and delay, at the same time increasing the packet delivery ratio.","","978-1-4244-3594-4;9781424435944","978-1-4244-3595-1;9781424435951","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787688","Detection;Dispersion;Malicious;Multipath;Reliable","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Dispersion;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;data forwarding operations;dispersion techniques;efficient dispersion algorithm;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath reliable routing algorithm;negative feedback;network layer security solution;node-disjoint reliable paths;packet delivery ratio;reliability index;security attacks","","3","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4244-4488-5;9781424444885","978-1-4244-4487-8;9781424444878","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7;9781467355247","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nobles built castles to control and defend their land and assets. Initially, these structures used natural defenses such as rivers or hills, but soon, earthworks such as mounds, banks and ditches were added for greater defense. In comparison, the first IT security model appeared in the early 1970s when academic institutions and forward thinking corporations recognized the need to control and defend their information assets These security measures started out as simple defenses, such as different passwords for each user, and perhaps the odd access-list on a router. Soon, however, more advanced precautions were being implemented, such as layered security, DMZs (demilitarized zones) and hardened hosts on the network. The article discusses how the evolution of an IT security system can use the model of the development of medieval castles. In the face of increasing costs of ownership, organizations will have to consider radical methods for limiting their financial exposure whilst reducing the infrastructure costs.

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines.

Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements.

Prevention methods as cryptographic techniques alone are not sufficient to make them secure; therefore, efficient intrusion detection must be deployed and elaborated to facilitate the identification of attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture. In this paper we give a survey of different architectures and methods of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for MANETs accordingly to the recent literature.","","978-1-4799-7053-7;9781479970537","","10.1109/WCCCS.2014.7107930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107930","MANETs;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Lead;Logic gates;Mobile computing;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;cryptographic techniques;intrusion detection systems;malicious attack;mobile ad hoc networks","","0","","32","","","27-28 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research efforts have focused on providing authentication and encryption techniques to secure the OLSR protocol against attacks from outside intruders. A second line of defense is required to provide intrusion detection and response techniques in protecting the OLSR protocol against attacks from inside intruders. In this paper, we describe security threats to the OLSR MANET routing protocol and present an intrusion detection solution based on protocol semantics checking. Our approach is based on semantic properties that are implied in the protocol definition and specify the correct OLSR routing update behavior. Conflict checking based on semantic properties is applied in every MANET node. Any abnormal protocol semantics triggers an intrusion alarm. While we use OLSR as an example, we argue that the presented approach can be applied to any multi-point relay (MPR) proactive MANET protocol.","","0-7803-9427-5;0780394275","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532054","","Authentication;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Protection;Relays;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","OLSR MANET protocol;intrusion detection approach;link state routing optimization;mobile ad hoc network;multipoint relay proactive MANET protocol;protocol semantics;response techniques;routing protocol","","23","1","8","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients. Security and complexity analysis show that the new scheme possesses several desirable features: 1) neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; 2) the new scheme is updatable, scalable, and robust against node capture attacks; and 3) communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2287196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650019","Pairwise key;deployment knowledge;matrix;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","Computational efficiency;Computer security;Knowledge engineering;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;matrix algebra;wireless mesh networks","WMN;complexity analysis;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh client;neighbor mesh clients;pre deployment knowledge;secret matrix;security analysis;wireless mesh networks","","1","","23","","2013-10-30","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies.

The versatility what's more adaptability brought by remote system made it conceivable in numerous applications. Among all the contemporary remote systems, Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a standout amongst the most imperative and special applications. On the in spite of conventional system structural engineering, MANET does not oblige an altered system base; each and every hub functions as both a transmitter and a collector. Hubs correspond specifically with one another when they are both inside the same correspondence range. Else, they depend on their neighbors to transfer messages. The planning toward oneself capacity of hubs in MANET made it prominent among basic mission applications like military utilization or crisis recuperation. On the other hand, the open medium and wide dissemination of hubs make MANET defenseless against malignant assailants. For this situation, it is essential to create proficient interruption identification instruments to ensure MANET from assaults. With the changes of the innovation furthermore cut in equipment costs, we are seeing a current pattern of growing Manets into mechanical applications. To acclimate to such pattern, we unequivocally accept that it is crucial to address its potential security issues.

Such actions include traffic remapping attacks (TRAs), which consist in claiming a higher traffic priority, i.e., false designation of the intrinsic traffic class so that it can be mapped onto a higher-priority class. In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","1","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, developing the network applications on network processors is not easy. How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8;0769521088","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-2161-4;0769521614","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years considerable efforts have been made to design secure and robust routing protocol, and many security schemes have been proposed to tackle these security issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of security threats in MANET. In particular, we examine all routing threats that can target the operation of routing protocol, whether they belong to selfish behaviors or malicious attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks.

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead","1072-4451;10724451","0-7695-2732-9;0769527329","","10.1109/MICRO.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841","","Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime","authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring","anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics","","2","","27","","","9-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes. Furthermore, it accommodates high loads, as it is able to handle sixteen times more security events per second than what was processed by the SIEM employed in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2016.2593442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517292","Application-level firewall;BFT;Denial-of-service;Intrusion Tolerance","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Protocols;Receivers;Resilience","","","","","","","","2016-07-20","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These efforts have been enriched through a formal approach, e.g., the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework, which is discussed in two earlier volumes in this series. This volume should help advance work not only in DLs, but also in the WWW and other information systems. Drawing upon four (Kozievitch, Murthy, Park, Yang) completed and three (Elsherbiny, Farag, Srinivasan) in-process dissertations, as well as the efforts of collaborating researchers and scores of related publications, presentations, tutorials, and reports, this book should advance the DL field with regard to at least six key technologies. By integrating surveys of the state-of-the-art, new research, connections with formalization, case studies, and exercises/projects, this book can serve as a computing or information science textbook. It can upport studies in cyber-security, document management, hypertext/hypermedia, IR, knowledge management, LIS, multimedia, and machine learning. Chapter 1, with a case study on fingerprint collections, focuses on complex (composite, compound) objects, connecting DL and related work on buckets, DCC, and OAI-ORE. Chapter 2, discussing annotations, as in hypertext/hypermedia, emphasizes parts of documents, including images as well as text, managing superimposed information. The SuperIDR system, and prototype efforts with Flickr, should motivate further development and standardization related to annotation, which would benefit all DL and WWW users. Chapter 3, on ontologies, explains how they help with browsing, query expansion, focused crawling, and classification. This chapter connects DLs with the Semantic Web, and uses CTRnet as an example. Chapter 4, on (hierarchical) classification, leverages LIS theory, as well as machine learning, and is important for DLs as well as the WWW. Chapter 5 on extraction from text, covers document segmentation, as well as how to construct a database from heterogeneous collections of references (from ETDs); i.e., converting strings to canonical forms. Chapter 6 surveys the security approaches used in information systems, and explains how those approaches can apply to digital libraries which are not fully open. Given this rich content, those interested in DLs will be able to find solutions to key problems, using the right technologies and methods. We hope this book will help show how formal approaches can enhance the development of suitable technologies and how they can be better integrated with DLs and other information systems.","","9781627050319","","10.2200/S00566ED1V01Y201401ICR033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813167.pdf&bkn=6813166&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2014","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster.

In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later.

When Detecting and reacting is known to handle predictable naïve attacks, prevention strategies should be used to deal with smart unknown ones. These are defined types of misbehavior in wireless MAC layer protocols. To study MAC layer misbehavior in IEEE 802.11 networks more systematically, we defined a framework named PCPD. This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it. Comparison of PCPD parameters for different types of misbehavior results in a comprehensible identification of their severity, network's reliability, and network's weak points.

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922","Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber","Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design","","","","2","","14","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an evasion technique to the Snort NIDS which exploits its flowbits feature. We specify the flowbit evasion attack and provide practical algorithms to solve it with controllable false positives and formally prove their correctness and completeness. We implemented a tool called SFET which can automatically parse a Snort rule set, generate all possible sequences that can evade it, as well as produce a patch to guard the rule set against those evasions.

Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz.

Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy.
