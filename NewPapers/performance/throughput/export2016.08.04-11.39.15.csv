In these environments security is extremely important because a successful attack against the network may pose a threat to human life. To secure such wireless networks against hostile attack requires both preventative and detective measures.In this paper we propose a novel intrusion detection mechanism that identifies man-in-the-middle and wormhole attacks against wireless mesh networks by external adversaries. A simple modification to the wireless MAC protocol is proposed to expose the presence of an adversary conducting a frame-relaying attack. We evaluate the modified MAC protocol experimentally and show the detection mechanism to have a high detection rate, no false positives and a small computational and communication overhead.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-4000-9;9781424440009","978-0-7695-3638-5;9780769536385","10.1109/AINA.2009.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076244","intrusion-detection;security;wireless network","Authentication;Communication system traffic control;Defense industry;Fingerprint recognition;Glass;Intrusion detection;Media Access Protocol;Sections;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless networks","access protocols;radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection mechanism;man-in-the-middle detection;wireless MAC protocol;wireless mesh network;wormhole attack","","1","","19","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various techniques for passive testing on Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) exist such as by invariants and by interval determination, which are not very costy in terms of complexity but that also dont detect every errors. To improve the fault detection capabilities a backward checking method was proposed. It analyzes in a backward fashion the input/output trace from passive testing and its past. It effectively checks both the control and data portion of a protocol system and is able to detect every errors, but with a higher complexity. The purpose of the present paper is then to propose possible parallel algorithms and architectures to improve the backward passive testing approach by narrowing down its maximal time complexity and transforming it into the first real-time exhaustive passive testing approach. We present the backward algorithm and its parallel versions, study their complexity, and report results on various communication and routing protocols.","","0-7695-2552-0;0769525520","","10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628288","","Automata;Concurrent computing;Control systems;Error correction;Fault detection;Parallel algorithms;Performance evaluation;Real time systems;Routing protocols;System testing","","","","0","","14","","","23-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The audit of the cloud computing system and network will provide insights on the security and performance of VMs and the operating system on multiple data centers and the intra-cloud network managed by cloud providers and the wide-area network between the cloud user and cloud provider.

For this reason, many cryptographic security protocols have been developed over the past decades in an attempt to protect the privacy between communicating parties and to reduce the risk of malicious attacks. However, most of the cryptographic algorithms developed so far are based on mathematical models and suffer from many security defects, such as: a brute force attack, factorization problem, and many others. Thus, most of these proposed cryptographic systems are not proven to be completely secure against the main threats of modern networking technologies and computing systems. In this paper, a security framework model for quantum cryptography system which is based on the physical properties of light particles is proposed and all security requirements to assist in ensuring confidentiality between communicating parties are incorporated. The research work in this paper is based on a series of experiments which have been advocated recently by some agencies and researchers who used the quantum technology as a more effective method for solving the key distribution problem.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The paper analyses the requirements of ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems and presents our approach for an IPS that runs on top of an active networking environment and is automatically configured by a vulnerability scanner. We call the system FIDRAN (Flexible Intrusion Detection and Response framework for Active Networks). The system autonomously analyses the home network and correspondingly configures the IPS. Furthermore, our system detects and adjusts itself to changes in the home network (new service, new host, etc.).

Network performance is sometimes reduced to unacceptable levels due to events such as congestion, equipment failure and information-warfare attacks. A popular solution to these problems is to increase available bandwidth within local area networks and across the wide area network. For the DoD, this option is often unavailable, especially for in-theater forces. It has been demonstrated that quality of service (QoS) policies, created with currently available commercial products, can improve the performance of IP-based networks by orders of magnitude. However, different QoS policies are needed to address specific scenarios such as a particular operational mission, a denial-of-service attack or bandwidth saturation. The network administrator must implement the appropriate QoS policy on an as-needed basis. This paper describes a prototype QoS event manager that automates the process of QoS policy implementation. Based on inputs from network monitoring devices, routers and humans, the QoS event manager selects an appropriate QoS policy and deploys it across the network. We discuss the QoS event manager design and consider issues regarding automated prioritization, tracking and deconfliction of QoS policies.","","0-7803-7225-5;0780372255","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985960","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Equipment failure;Local area networks;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Prototypes;Quality management;Quality of service;Wide area networks","computer network management;local area networks;military communication;military computing;quality of service;wide area networks","DoD;IP network;QoS event manager;QoS policies;automated prioritization;automated tracking;bandwidth saturation;congestion;denial-of-service attack;equipment failure;in-theater forces;information-warfare attacks;local area networks;network administrator;network monitoring devices;network performance;quality of service;routers;wide area network","","0","","","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

FPT 2009. International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8;9781424443758","978-1-4244-4377-2;9781424443772","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","5","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, nested virtualization has gained popularity in research as an approach that could enable cloud customers to use virtualization-based solutions within a cloud by nesting two virtual machine monitors, with the inner one under control of the client.

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","40","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

As the available MAC and routing protocols applied to WMNs do not have enough scalability as throughput drops significantly as the number of nodes or hops increases. Existing security schemes may be effective for certain types of attacks, but they lack a comprehensive mechanism to prevent attacks from different protocol layers. Similar problems exist in other networking protocols. Thus, existing communication protocols, ranging from routing, MAC, and physical layers, need to be revisited and enhanced.

By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic.

Security concerns for network operators include all the same concerns for enterprise networks and many additional challenges. The approach used to provide security for business customers, which differs from residential, is the segregation of business services, even Internet access, into separate IP address ranges and classes of services. Provisioning is the process of making provisions with network and system resources required to provide a service. Perhaps the greatest challenge for OAMPT is not the ongoing addition of new technologies to operate and support, but to maintain backward compatibility with often aging technologies.

The U.S. Army uses Secure Wireless Local Area Network (SWLAN) with IEEE 802.11 standard waveforms to quickly set up Tactical Operations Center communications without cables. A SWLAN provides extremely secure mobile wireless data communication with COMSEC, TRANSEC, and monitoring systems to detect PHY and MAC layer misbehavior. However, the SWLAN cannot mitigate a smart jammer that transmits back-to-back packets on the detected channel after scanning all of the channels until a legitimate communication hops to a new channel. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive rapid channel-hopping scheme using Dwell Window and a Deception Mechanism to mitigate smart jammer attacks. The Dwell Window is a novel concept to adjust transmission time based on jammer's capability. The Deception Mechanism is another novel concept to force the jammer to attack an inactive channel by deceiving the jammer. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is more effective than prior studies.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4673-0079-7;9781467300797","","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127469","Anti-jamming;Channel hopping;Medium Access Control;Secure Wireless Local Area Network","Delta modulation;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Jamming;Sensors;Switches;Throughput;Wireless LAN","IEEE standards;military communication;monitoring;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","COMSEC;IEEE 802.11 standard waveform;MAC layer misbehavior;TRANSEC;US Army;adaptive rapid channel-hopping scheme;back-to-back packets;communication hops;deception mechanism;detected channel;inactive channel;monitoring system;network centric warfare;numerical analysis;quickly-deployable communication solution;secure WLAN;secure mobile wireless data communication;secure wireless local area network;smart jammer attacks;tactical operations center communications","","4","","9","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of Cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer's “Theory of Evidence” we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches. The proposed ADS is validated in a scenario assessing the consequences of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and the propagation of such disturbances to the operation of a simulated power grid.","2325-6648;23256648","","","10.1109/DSNW.2013.6615505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615505","Anomaly Detection System;DDoS;Data Fusion;MPLS;Networked Critical Infrastructures;SCADA","Feature extraction;Ions;Monitoring;Throughput;Weaving","computer network security;inference mechanisms;multiprotocol label switching;power grids;virtual private networks","ADS;DDoS attack;Dempster-Shafer theory-of-evidence;ICT system attack;MPLS;NCI;VPN;anomaly detection system;cyber-physical anomaly;cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical data fusion;distributed denial-of-service;information and communication technologies;multiprotocol label switching;networked critical infrastructure;power grid;virtual private network","","2","","27","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel defense architecture that blocks malicious traffic far from the protected servers is proposed. Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality.

Several techniques are introduced to reassemble TCP packets on FPGA. However, they have some disadvantages such as inefficient memory, unscalable system, and unsupported complex TCP connections. In this paper, we propose a multi-linked-list approach and a combination of edge buffering scheme for TCP reassembly, which helps detecting cross packets intrusion signatures.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing.

Hardware solutions are available and result in much higher efficiency but present problems such as flexibility and cost. Our proposed system uses a modified version of Snort, a robust widely deployed open-sourced NIDS. Snort spends a significant fraction of its processing time doing pattern matching. Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then off loads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The hardware is able to process data at up to 1.7 GB/s on one Xilinx XC2VP100 FPGA. Our system is more flexible than other FPGA string matching designs in that the rules are not hard-coded.

The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","47","","2015-03-27","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

Empirical studies show that as the rule set grows larger, power consumption and delay time for processing IP Packets particularly on Hardware firewalls increases extremely, and, therefore the performance of the firewall decreases proportionally. This paper present a new FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) based firewall with high performance, high processing speed, low power consumption, and low space utilization in contrast with early submitted paper in some of credible international conferences. First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption. Based on this model, only the security rules are updated by admin during the configuration process while other hardware part would remain unchanged. The proposed architecture is written in VHDL standard language and it is simulated and synthesized with ALTERA QUARTUS II software. Finally, for validation of proposed architecture, we implemented the synthesized code on 3 of ALTERA FPGAs families (STRATIX III, CYCLONE III, CYCLONE II), and then results have been compared with earlier results.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678545","","Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Registers;Synchronization","IP networks;authorisation;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","ALTERA QUARTUS II software;FPGA;IP packet;SOC;VHDL;configuration process;field programmable gate array;hardware firewall implementation;pipeline technique;power consumption","","0","","17","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

At the same time, the LIDF can reduce the rate of the analyzed traffic and achieve better performance by increasing the throughput without affecting its main goal.","","978-1-4799-8171-7;9781479981717","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7210298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210298","Artificial Neural Network;Data Mining;Intrusion Detection;cloud computing","Artificial neural networks;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Training","cloud computing;data mining;invasive software;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","ANN;Internet era;LIDF;artificial neural network;cloud computing;cloud intrusion detection system service;cloud traffic;data mining;layered intrusion detection framework;malware;normal traffic;online financial transactions","","0","","22","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS.

To solve such a problem, a head cluster is elected by the nodes to handle the detection service. Current solution elects a leader randomly without considering the energy level of nodes. Such solution is vulnerable to selfish nodes that do not provide IDS service to others while at the same time benefiting from others' services. From our experiments, selfish nodes reduce the effectiveness of an IDS since less packets are inspected over time. Here, we are modeling a distributed, truthful, and efficient mechanism for electing a leader IDS that handles the detection process in a cluster. Our solution is able to balance the energy among all the nodes and increase the overall lifetime of an IDS in a cluster. In our model, incentives are given in the form of reputation to encourage the nodes to cooperate in the leader election process. The reputation is used to track the cooperative behavior of nodes where miss-behaving nodes are punished by withholding the cluster's services. Reputations are calculated based on the truth-telling mechanism design known as Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG). Our analysis prove that truth-telling is the dominant strategy for all the nodes and therefore efficiency is guaranteed. Finally, simulation results show that our mechanism improves the performance of an IDS in analyzing packets and punishes misbehaving nodes.","2160-4886;21604886","978-0-7695-2889-2;9780769528892","","10.1109/WIMOB.2007.4390872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4390872","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Microeconomics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile communication;telecommunication security","IDS election mechanism;MANET;intrusion detection system;leader election process;miss-behaving nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;reputations;selfish nodes;truth-telling mechanism design","","3","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4244-4488-5;9781424444885","978-1-4244-4487-8;9781424444878","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5;9781424484485","978-0-7695-4236-2;9780769542362","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route. Using analysis and simulation results, we show that the TUF architecture is effective in thwarting a wide range of attacks, including protocol-compliant (also known as ""JellyFish"") attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150899","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer security;Cryptography;Information security;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Snow;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;TUF architecture;cross-layer technique;goodput monitoring;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer;protocol-compliant attacks;route rebuilding process;routing disruption denial-of-service attacks;secure routing architecture;throughput-feedback routing;transport layer","","2","","20","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Searching through entire packet headers and payloads, NIDSs can identify and classify the packets that contain malicious patterns. The most essential technology to the NIDS is an efficient multiple-pattern matching algorithm, which performs exact string matching between packets and a large set of patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm (HMA) for intrusion detection, which is a two-tier and cluster-wise matching algorithm. HMA drastically reduces the amount of external memory access as well as required memory space, enabling an efficient and cost-effective real-time IDS. The simulations show that HMA significantly improves the matching performance in both the average and the worst cases (about 1.7-63 times better than the state-of-the-art algorithms).","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577938","","Clustering algorithms;Data security;Databases;Engines;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection","computer networks;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication security","cluster-wise matching algorithm;hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm;malicious patterns;network security threats;network-based intrusion detection system;packet headers;payloads;string matching;two-tier matching algorithm","","2","2","17","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic.

Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4577-2135-9;9781457721359","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","2","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198833","","Application software;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security","DFA Structure;deterministic finite automata;indirect index;multiple regular expressions matching;parallel SRAMs;real-time deep packet inspection;regular expression matcher","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol.

Novel sequence encoding we proposed keeps all matching results output one by one in exactly one conventional lookup period. And the design is prototyped in an Altera FPGA and proved fast enough to sustain OC48 traffic throughput.","","978-1-4244-4223-2;9781424442232","","10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4908346","Multi-match Classification;Network Security;Packet Classification","Associative memory;Communication system security;Computer networks;Databases;Encoding;Filters;Impedance matching;Intrusion detection;National security;Throughput","content-addressable storage;encoding;field programmable gate arrays;pattern classification;pattern matching;security of data","Altera FPGA;field programmable gate array;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;parallel matching;sequence encoding scheme;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","14","","","25-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some limitations such as reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect sensor nodes. These limitations mostly affect the security of wireless networks. Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for detecting and monitoring selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shapley value is used to formally express the cooperation among all the nodes. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study for the case where the intrusions in MANETs are analyzed, in order to decrease false positives, using cooperative game theory.

Sometimes, however, they have exploitable weaknesses, allowing an adversary to bypass them in different ways. Therefore, their design should include improved resilience capabilities to allow them to operate correctly in highly adverse environments. This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions.

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed.

A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later. We present algorithms that apply speculation in single-threaded software running on commodity processors as well as algorithms for parallel hardware.

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it. Comparison of PCPD parameters for different types of misbehavior results in a comprehensible identification of their severity, network's reliability, and network's weak points.

Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz.

However, these proposals suffer from the problems of tests and evaluations. Among these solutions the intrusion detection systems (IDS). To improve the quality of protection of MANETs provided by intrusion detection systems (IDS), we provide assessment of detection and test procedures more effective.

Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions.

Very rarely the economics involved in the energy correction and economics of optimized energy are validated.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","5","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we have proposed a novel and robust IDS for MANETs that aims to combine misuse with anomaly detection. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme that detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms.

This article offers a broad survey of techniques aimed at tackling latency in the literature up to August 2014, and their merits. A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) the structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, especially significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable. Solutions addressing these sources often both reduce the overall latency and make it more predictable.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2375213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967689","Data communication;Internet;algorithms;bufferbloat;comparative evaluation;congestion control;cross-layer;latency;networks;performance;protocols;queuing delay;standards;taxonomy","Delays;Internet;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Tutorials","","","","5","","","","2014-11-26","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A novel approach to analyse and model network traffic anomalies is presented. The proposed approach individually characterises different aspects of anomalies, such as origin, termination, propagation and changes in duration and volume, with common random processes. These characteristics are then integrated into a single model that successfully captures the overall anomaly behaviours. Characterisation of each anomaly property requires only a few parameters, leading to a concise set of parameters for the entire model. Although the model is calibrated with local measurements made at nodes, it successfully represents the global behaviours of anomalies over the network. The proposed model is applicable both at nodal level and at subnet level. This enables hierarchically analysing large and sophisticated networks. Anomalies are analysed using a multi-scale analysis framework based on which, a real-time monitoring system that efficiently communicate ongoing anomaly information across the network is developed. The system is also used for learning regional model parameters distributively. Internet2 traffic data is analysed using the framework, and the corresponding model parameters are derived. These results provide insight on the nature of anomalies in networks.","2047-4954;20474954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2013.0123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786899","","","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic anomalies;Internet2 trafflc data;anomaly property;common random processes;global behaviours;multiscale analysis framework;network performance studies;network provisioning;network trafflc anomalies;real-time monitoring system;regional model parameters;robust network design;sophisticated networks;spatiotemporal model","","0","","","","","March 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques.

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8;9781457701108","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","2","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The processing speed of one IDS cannot achieve the throughput requirement in the core networks because of the pattern matching, the key operation for signature-based IDS, is complex and time consuming. In this paper, it argues that if the signature set is shared by multiple IDSs, a packet needs to be checked once and once only by one of the IDSs, so traffic load can be redistributed among the IDSs to avoid local congestion. Packet marking is used to indicate the status of this packet utilized by collaborative IDSs, and a redistribution strategy named inner logical ring (ILR) is built among IDSs to redistribute the traffic load. Meanwhile, caching scheme is used to keep sequence for packets belonging to the same flow. This collaborative distributed IDS is robust with rapid response to various attacks, and the detection throughput is significantly increased from the throughput of the weakest IDS to the summation of all the collaborative IDSs.","2153-1447;21531447","978-0-7695-3431-2;9780769534312","","10.1109/FGCN.2008.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734082","attack detection;collaborative detection;pattern matching;signature-based;traffic load distribution","Computer science;Computer viruses;Computer worms;IP networks;International collaboration;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;groupware;security of data","Internet users protection;caching scheme;collaborative distributed intrusion detection system;signature-based intrusion detection system;traffic load","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

This paper describes the implementation of a network intrusion detection system for discovering malicious Bluetooth traffic. The work improves upon existing techniques, which only detect a limited set of attacks (based on measuring anomalies in the power levels of the Bluetooth device). The new method identifies reconnaissance, denial of service, and information theft attacks on Bluetooth enabled devices, using signatures of the attacks. Furthermore, this system includes an intrusion response component to detect attacks in progress, based on the attack classification.

A regular expression matching algorithm used in intrusion detection systems is expected to process data at a speed linear in size of the incoming data and also to be able to run on network devices with limited memory. Traditional DFA and NFA based algorithms fail to meet either of these two requirements. The existing techniques try to either modify a DFA or a NFA, or combine both these to find a trade off between speed and memory requirements. The idea we propose in this paper is orthogonal to existing techniques. We propose a new approach to store a finite automaton in memory which otherwise is stored as a transition table.

Traditional processors are not keeping up with the performance demands, whereas specialized hardware will never be able to compete with commodity hardware in terms of cost effectiveness, reusability and ease of programming. Advanced multi-core architectures like the IBM Cell Broadband Engine promise unprecedented performance at a low cost, thanks to their popularity and production volume. Nevertheless, the suitability of the cell processor to string matching has not been investigated so far. In this paper we investigate the performance attainable by the cell processor when employed for string matching algorithms based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). Our findings show that the cell is an ideal candidate to tackle modern security needs: two processing elements alone, out of the eight available on one cell processor provide sufficient computational power to filter a network link with bit rates in excess of 10 Gbps.","1530-2075;15302075","1-4244-0909-8;1424409098","1-4244-0910-1;1424409101","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228362","","Automata;Computer networks;Costs;Data security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Production","cellular automata;deterministic automata;finite state machines;security of data;string matching","IBM Cell Broadband Engine;cell processor;deterministic finite-state automata;intrusion detection system;multicore architecture;string matching","","12","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, peer-to-peer traffic may compromise the performance of enterprise critical networked applications or network-based tasks or may overload the network infrastructure of Internet service providers, being desirable that this traffic be blocked in some situations. However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The proposed method is based on eMule signatures, which are coded as SNORT rules, this system being used to detect and block eMule traffic. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed method.

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Johnson","","Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","185","190","A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48.

Recent advances in Ethernet-based technology have taken this industry from shared 10 Mbps LAN segments to switched 100 Mbps LANs followed by 1 Gbps backbones for metropolitan area networks (MANs) and more recently 10 Gbps Ethernet technology for use in wide-area networks (WANs). Up until now, intersubstation communications typically have been provided by a SONET/SDH communication infrastructure. Although well understood and widely deployed, this legacy approach is not optimized for data traffic and requires protocol mapping and/or translation at both ends of the interface. The more recent trend of migrating towards voice over IP services combined with the advent of low-cost gigabit Ethernet switches and low-cost long-haul fiber optics has made it possible to deploy native Ethernet networks in wide-area applications. This paper looks at the new capabilities in substation automation, protection, and control made possible by native intersubstation Ethernet. Analysis is made of the current capabilities of this technology and state of the art tools available for Ethernet network management. The paper also examines application examples such as: Ethernet-based POTT protection schemes and synchrophasor data collection infrastructure.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772624","","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Protocols;Radio network;Redundancy;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","Byzantine failure of nodes;centralized monitoring points;cooperative radio network;distributed intrusion detection system;intrusion detection protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc network;routing information;transient network partitioning;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.","","","","10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259","IDS;network security;open source","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems","","2","","23","","","11-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we classify MITM attacks based on several parameters, like location of an attacker in the network, nature of a communication channel, and impersonation techniques. Based on an impersonation techniques classification, we then provide execution steps for each MITM class. We survey existing countermeasures and discuss the comparison among them. Finally, based on our analysis, we propose a categorisation of MITM prevention mechanisms, and we identify some possible directions for future research.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2016.2548426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442758","MITM classification;MITM defence techniques;Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack;security","3G mobile communication;Communication channels;GSM;IP networks;Open systems;Security;Tutorials","","","","","","","","2016-03-29","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","2","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant.

To solve this problem, we focused on anomaly-detection methods. Although these methods have been proposed for computer systems, few studies have focused on IP networks. Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations. Evaluation results show that the anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector is effective in detecting network faults in IP networks, but it has two problems. One is that this method may detect normal states as anomalies and the other is that optimizing the discounting factor for detecting sequential faults is difficult.","","978-1-4577-1668-3;9781457716683","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077024","Fault Detection;IP Network;Matrix Eigenvector;Multi-Variant Analysis","Bandwidth;Data models;Fault detection;IP networks;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Vectors","IP networks;computer network performance evaluation;computer network reliability;computer network security;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;fault location;matrix algebra","IP network reliability;anomaly detection method;matrix eigenvector;network fault detection method;network fault simulation;network monitoring alarms","","2","","6","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rapid and infrastructure-less deployment in emergency and military situations make these networks unique. However, certain inherently vulnerable characteristics lead to security concerns, which can prove especially damaging in sensitive situations like military operations. Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme and detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms.

The network operation is decentralized as the network's organization/message delivery is effected by nodes. A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is functional in either a stand-alone manner or connected to large networks. In this work, a hybrid optimization technique using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Cuckoo Search (CS) is proposed for the optimization of MANET routing.

Our novelty is in the frequency minimization and consequent location selection of target movement across heterogeneous virtual machines based on attack probability, which in turn minimizes cloud management overheads. We evaluate effectiveness of our scheme using a large-scale GENI testbed for a just-in-time news feed application setup.

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces.

One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","1","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware.

The majority of the data-plane traffic is distributed via the switch's built-in traffic distribution function and no connection state is kept. If the load balancing controller detects a skew in the load of the DPP appliances, it updates the traffic rules in the switch to redirect new connections to less busy DPP appliances. This adaptive solution is beneficial for load-balancing at high data rates because state is kept for only the redirected connections. For typical traffic patterns, our solution reduces the packet drops with minimal connection redirection. We show an example capture, where we are able to improve the packet drop rate by 94.8% with only 3% of the connections being redirected.","1944-0367;19440367","978-1-4577-1264-7;9781457712647","","10.1109/LANMAN.2011.6076946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076946","","Clocks;Hardware;Home appliances;IP networks;Servers;Switches","local area networks;resource allocation","DPP;Ethernet switch;adaptive load balancing;data plane traffic;deep packet processing;high performing scaleout solution;load balancing controller;traffic distribution function","","0","","7","","","13-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20050502","2004","","","135","138","Improving network security systems by using recon gurable hardware is an important research eld since the speed of the Internet is increasing. In this work, we have implemented stateful TCP inspection in a Field Programmable Gate Array (EPGA) to help alleviating a bottleneck in network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs). Today's software based NIDSs (eg. Snort) show inef ciency and even fail to perform for the faster Internet. Implementing stateful TCP inspection in EPGA aims at achieving an ef cient, fast NIDS in general, - Snort speci cally. By dividing a TCP connection into two ows, one to the Sewer and another to the Client, monitoring of the TCP ow can be sped up. A TCP ow deals not only with a single packet but also with multiple packets over the network. Reassembly of those packets is one of the main tusks that the TCP ow monitoring should accomplish. By parallelizing the tasks of reassembling TCP packets on the Sewer and the Client on an EPGA, the performance of stateful TCP inspection can be greatly improved. The performance obtained by this work is a throughput of 2.75 Gbps.","","0-7803-8510-1;0780385101","","10.1109/NORCHP.2004.1423841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423841","","Communication system security;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Informatics;Inspection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","","","","0","2","9","","","8-9 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT).

IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted.

Many works have been carried out for the past several years targeting different goals including Quality-of-Service support, security, management, and provisioning. However, these approaches are developed and evaluated separately without a general model that can be used to identify, categorize, and compare them. Thus, it is difficult for a newcomer to understand the principle of flow classification and to find a suitable method for her domain. This paper brings forth a mathematical model that describes the flow classification components and processes on an abstract level.

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Li","Dept. of Autom., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","20110728","2011","","","1","5","Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets. Implemented in a single Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform, RCDFA matching engine achieved 12Gbps throughput.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5963291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963291","","Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Pattern matching;Throughput","computer networks;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;telecommunication traffic","Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform;bitmap technique;content aware network processing;deterministic finite automata;next state transitions;regular expression matching;reorganized and compact DFA","","3","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination). We explore the security, cost, and accuracy of our protocol.","","0-7695-2375-7;0769523757","","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540983","","Costs;Directional antennas;Loss measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Protocols;Robustness;Security;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;data integrity;directive antennas;message authentication;mobile radio;monitoring;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","authenticity report;civilian application;data integrity;directional antenna;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring function;packet forwarding report;secure link layer acknowledgment;traffic forwarding activity;traffic measurement","","1","","20","","","17-21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through this work we develop a method to generate realistic network traffic in laboratory conditions without the need of a real PCS installation. This is indeed our main contribution as the basis of future anomaly detection systems. Such method could support experimentation through the recreation of realistic traffic in simulated environments. The accuracy and fidelity of the proposed approach was validated with several statistical methods that compare the predicted traffic with traffic taken from a real in stallation.","1946-0740;19460740","978-1-4673-4735-8;9781467347358","978-1-4673-4736-5;9781467347365","10.1109/ETFA.2012.6489550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6489550","","","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;critical infrastructures;process control;security of data;statistical analysis","Duqu;ICT hardware;ICT software;ICT vulnerability;Information and Communication Technology;Night Dragon;PCS installation;SCADA system;Stuxnet;Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system;anomaly detection system;attack scenario;critical infrastructure;experimentation environment;network traffic model;process control system;security study;statistical method","","2","","17","","","17-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tool automates the creation of efficient field programmable gate array architectures (FPGA). The generated hardware allows an FPGA-based system to perform deep-packet inspection of streams at up to 10 Gb/s line rates at a high level of area efficiency. Going beyond previous basic string-matching implementations that offer only single-string matching, the architecture provides support for rules requiring complex, linked (correlated-content) constructions.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727","LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors","Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data","Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring","","0","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%.

By exploiting vulnerability in existing protocols and infrastructures, malicious attackers consume resources in networks and servers to block or degrade the service to legitimate users. TCP is the dominant network transport protocol. It relies on the participating hosts' cooperation to make data transmission successful. This kind of trust has been exploited in some DoS attacks, such as SYN-flooding attack. In this paper, we investigate how a TCP client can extend the duration of its connection with a server only by setting the pace of sending back acknowledgement packets. Our study shows that the duration of a TCP connection could be extended tens of times without incurring timeout retransmission. This mechanism can potentially be used by attackers to launch DoS attacks by generating simultaneous prolonged TCP connections with the victim servers. Unlike SYN-flooding attacks, the low rate property of slow TCP connections makes the detection of this kind of attack difficult, which calls for a further study on this issue.","0191-2216;01912216","0-7803-8682-5;0780386825","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428610","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Contracts;Data communication;Degradation;Delay;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Transport protocols","client-server systems;internetworking;telecommunication services;transport protocols","SYN-flooding attack;client-controlled slow TCP;denial of service attacks;information infrastructure;network transport protocol","","1","","20","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Munchen, Munich, Germany","IFIP Networking Conference, 2013","20131114","2013","","","1","9","Many current traffic monitoring systems employ deep packet inspection (DPI) in order to analyze network traffic. These systems include intrusion detection systems, software for network traffic accounting, traffic classification, or systems for monitoring service-level agreements. Traffic volumes and link speeds of current enterprise and ISP networks transform the process of inspecting traffic payload into a challenging task. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive sampling algorithm that selects the maximum number of packets from the network that the DPI system is able to consume. Our algorithm adapts its sampling rate according to the network traffic currently observed, and the number of packets that a monitoring application is able to process. It can be used in conjunction with current multicore-aware network traffic analysis setups, which allow for exploiting current multi-core hardware. We show the applicability of our algorithm with live-tests on a heavily used 10G link with real network monitoring tools.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663536","","Algorithm design and analysis;Hardware;Instruction sets;Monitoring;Packet loss;Payloads","Internet;inspection;performance evaluation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","DPI;ISP networks;adaptive load-aware sampling;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;intrusion detection systems;multicore commodity hardware;multicore-aware network traffic analysis;network monitoring tools;network traffic accounting;service level agreements;traffic classification;traffic monitoring systems;traffic payload","","1","","32","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the existing energy efficient routing protocols utilize the power management feature provided by MAC layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 PSM). The rationale behind these protocols is to power down (put in sleep) the redundant nodes that do not involve in the packets routing. To keep a low end-to-end latency and preserve the routing fidelity, a group of nodes are selected to constitute a virtual backbone throughout the network. The backbone nodes do not sleep all the time serving for the packets routing while the rest of nodes turn to sleep mode if there is no packet to send or receive. Backbone nodes are periodically selected and replaced; the current selection and replacement mechanism mainly concerns the energy balance and fairness among the network nodes while the security threat is not considered. In this paper, we present that the adversary may launch security attacks against the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the backbone node selection algorithm. To address this problem, we propose a biased random selection algorithm to prevent the security attacks. The evaluation results indicate that with the aid of reputation system, the proposed biased random selection scheme is more secure than the random selection scheme while trading for a limited amount of power efficiency.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698160","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Energy management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power system management;Protocols;Routing;Spine","access protocols;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAC layer;biased random selection algorithm;energy efficient routing protocol;power saving;secure virtual backbone-based power management;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance.

Any adverse impact that these observed trends may have on Internet traffic flows can result in sub par performance, which in turn results in unsatisfactory user experience. To study such adverse impacts, we examine in this paper the flow-level performance of popular applications across a range of size-based flow-classes and applications. We use out-of-sequence packets, retransmissions, throughput, and RTTs as key flow performance metrics. Leveraging data sets collected from two complementary network environments, we compare these metrics for popular applications and for the up/downstream directions. We show that irrespective of the direction, flows are severely impacted by the specifics of the network, e.g., DSL or CDN and application behavior. We also find that, in general, this impact differs markedly across the different flow-classes. In particular, contrary to popular belief, the small flows from all applications, which make up the majority of flows, experience significant retransmissions, while the very large flows, although small in number, experience very limited retransmissions. In terms of application-related performance, we observe that especially when compared to HTTP, apart from large flows, P2P flows suffer from continuously high retransmissions and low throughput. As for the root cause of these retransmissions, we identify the access part of the network as the main culprit and not the network core.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857100","","DSL;Internet;Measurement;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Throughput","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","CDN;DSL;Internet traffic flows;P2P flows;RTT;application behavior;application-related performance;flow-level performance;high-speed access links;key flow performance metrics;out-of-sequence packets;retransmissions;size-based flow-classes;throughput","","0","","45","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity in order to meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","23","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2016.2517407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378982","Network Security;OpenFlow;Software Defined Networking;Software-defined networking;network security;policy specification;policy-based network management","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Software;Switches","computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","GENI testbed;OpenFlow matching fields;OpenFlow messages;OpenFlow-based security framework;OpenSec;SDN;campus networks;human-readable language;intrusion detection;network devices;network security operator;network-aware controller;packet inspection;policy-based security;policy-driven network management;security policies;security services;software-based controller;software-defined networking;source nodes;spam detection","","","","35","","2016-01-12","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4244-8454-6;9781424484546","978-1-4244-8455-3;9781424484553","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","4","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol.

The features of MANETs are like open media, dynamic changes in topology, cooperative and collaborative algorithm and no centralized monitoring system. These features make the network more prone to malicious attack. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster.

An IP flow is a unidirectional series of IP packets of a given protocol, traveling between a source and destination, within a certain period of time. Based on ""flow"" concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as ""flow key"". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow. This novel IDS has been evaluated by using DARPA 98 data and CONEX test-bed data.

The lack of infrastructuresupport and resource constraint is the key issue that causesdishonest and non-co-operative nodes. Therefore, MANET isvulnerable to serious attacks. To reduce the hazards from suchnodes and enhance the security of the network, this paperextends an Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector(AOMDV) Routing protocol, named as Trust-based Secured Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (TS-AOMDV), whichis based on the nodes' routing behavior. The proposed TSAOMDVaims at identifying and isolating the attacks such asflooding, black hole, and gray hole attacks in MANET. With thehelp of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and trust-based routing, attack identification and isolation are carried out in two phases ofrouting such as route discovery and data forwarding phase. IDSfacilitates complete routing security by observing both controlpackets and data packets that are involved in the routeidentification and the data forwarding phases. To improve therouting performance, the IDS integrates the measured statisticsinto the AOMDV routing protocol for the detection of attackers. This facilitates the TS-AOMDV to provide better routingperformance and security in MANET. Finally, the Trust basedSecured AOMDV, TS-AOMDV is compared with the existingAOMDV through the NS2 based simulation model. Theperformance evaluation reveals that the proposed TS-AOMDVimproves the performance in terms of throughput by 57.1%more than that of an AOMDV under adversary scenario.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0;9780769537160","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET.

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","2158-6985;21586985","978-1-4244-6356-5;9781424463565","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","4","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering methods allow fast connection, better routing and topology management of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). This paper, we have introduced new mechanism called Energy Efficiency and Secure Communication Protocol (EESCP) is to divide the MANET into a set of 2-hop clusters where each node belongs to at least one cluster. The nodes in each cluster elect a leader node (cluster head) to serve as the IDS for the entire cluster. To balance the resource consumption weight based leader election model is used, which elected an optimal collection of leaders to minimize the overall resource consumption and obtaining secure communication using diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.","","978-1-4673-1037-6;9781467310376","","10.1109/ICPRIME.2012.6208348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208348","EESCP;Mobile adhoc networs;leader election;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Energy states;Lead;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","2-hop clusters;EESCP;MANET;clustering methods;cryptographic protocols;diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol;energy efficiency and secure communication protocol;intrusion detection techniques;key management schemes;leader node;mobile ad hoc networks;optimal collection;resource consumption weight based leader election model;routing management;secure communication;security attacks;topology management","","2","","14","","","21-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing tools or techniques are quite limited. For instance, system events tracking lacks completeness of intrusion propagation, while dynamic taint tracking is not feasible to be deployed due to significant runtime overhead. Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%. The real-life intrusion studies show the advantage of PEDA intrusion analysis over existing techniques.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2162062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954181","Forward and backward tracking;heterogeneous virtual machine (VM) migration;taint analysis","Checkpointing;Runtime;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","file servers;security of data;virtual machines","PEDA;binary-translation-based virtual machine;comprehensive damage assessment;hardware-assisted virtual machine;has-been-infected execution;heavy workload analysis;intrusion analysis;intrusion propagation;production environment damage assessment;production environment server systems;production servers;system events tracking;system security","","0","","38","","2011-07-14","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","6","2","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4;0769527884","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security","","0","1","10","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain.

A type of wireless network, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous system of mobile nodes where a collection of mobile hosts with wireless network interfaces form a temporary network without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The success of MANET strongly depends on its security. Security is an essential service for wireless network communications especially in mission-critical applications like military applications. A variety of attacks such as Warmhole, Blackhole, Byzantine, Rushing/Flooding, Anonymity/Location Disclosure, Denial of Service etc have been identified and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, existing published solutions typically concentrate on particular type of attacks and are incapable of identifying threats, which occur as a result of combination of these attacks. As overall security level is determined by the system's weakest point, a distributed security scheme that uses an integrated approach to address a combination of these attacks is very much necessary. The work in progress aims to investigate the possible combination of attacks that can be addressed by integrating some of the existing work on mobile ad hoc networks security, which addresses a portion of the security concerns individually. The analysis of attacks and existing mechanisms that would help to design an integrated approach for security services is presented in this paper.","","978-1-4673-8809-2;9781467388092","","10.1109/HMI.2016.7449197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449197","Communication Network Security;MANET Security;Secure Routing;Security Survey","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;attacks analysis;distributed security scheme;mission-critical application;mobile ad hoc network security;mobile host collection;secure routing;wireless network communication","","","","50","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative. Based on these values the Accuracy and error rate of each classifier is computed.","","978-1-4799-5521-3;9781479955213","","10.1109/ICCICT.2015.7045674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045674","Feature selection;Hidden Naïve Bayes;NBTree;Naïve Bayes;classification;discretization","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Training","data mining;decision trees;feature selection;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","NBTree classifiers;NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes method conditional independence assumption;data dimensionality;data mining approach;data mining model;data preprocessing activities;decision tree classifiers;dimension reduction;feature discretization;feature selection algorithm;hidden Naive Bayes classifiers;machine learning algorithms;record class label identification","","0","","20","","","15-17 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures. Evaluation of F-Sign was conducted under various conditions. The findings suggest that the proposed method can be used for automatically generating signatures that are both specific and sensitive.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2068544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585792","Automatic signature generation (ASG);malware;malware filtering","Binary codes;Grippers;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Real time systems;Software","digital signatures;error detection;finite state machines;invasive software","F-sign;IDA-Pro;automatic extraction;automatic signature generation;common function repository;deep packet inspection;entropy score;false positive detection error;function-based signature generation;high speed network traffic filtering device;intelligent candidate selection;malware;signature candidate list;signature extraction process;state machine","","1","","38","","2010-09-27","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495980","","Ad hoc networks;Computer vision;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Training data;Wireless LAN","access protocols;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MAC layer anomaly detection;MAC layer traffic data;WLAN;ad hoc networks;attack source localization;behavior characterization;cross-feature analysis;end-to-end intrusion detection mechanism;feature vectors;mobile node;network layer misbehavior;ns-2 simulations;routing attacks;wired network;wireless local area networks","","6","1","21","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","2","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be highly effective, NIDS must perform packet inspection of incoming traffic at or near wire speed. Failing to do so will allow malicious packets to sneak through the network undetected, and thus jeopardising network security. Snort is one of the most popular IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) applications. Snort is a publicly available open-source NIDS application that typically runs on Linux. In this study, the authors present and discuss the essential software components of Snort and its underlying Linux support architecture. The authors characterise Snort execution and present an analytical queuing model to give insight into understanding the kernel and Snort behaviour as well as to identify key-dominating factors that strongly influence and impact Snort performance. The authors demonstrate that the current default configurations of the packet reception mechanism of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) are not suitable for Snort performance and show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters, specifically by having a small NAPI budge value of 2. The performance is measured in terms of throughput and packet loss. The authors also measure the packet loss encountered at the kernel level as well as the interrupt rate of incoming traffic. Performance was measured when subjecting a PC host running Snort to both normal and malicious traffic, and with different traffic load conditions.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2009.0114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5343506","","","Linux;computer networks;queueing theory;reception;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Linux;NIDS;Snort performance;analytical queuing model;computer network;intrusion prevention system;malicious packets;network intrusion detection system;network security;network throughput;network traffic;networking subsystem;packet inspection;packet loss;packet reception","","4","","","","","December 2009","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network.

Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness. Network class has network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to perceive network security status.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","1","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basis of the method is command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To simplify the process, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. As such it does not depend on the communication architecture. The method is based on new developments on dynamic state estimation based protection and substation level distributed state estimation. This infrastructure provides the capability to monitor, intercept, and authenticate/block commands as they reach the relay and the control circuits of the relay. Since all controls are exercise through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The authentication/blockage of commands is done quickly because of the distributed approach which enables quick assembly of a local real time model and fast analytics with this local model. Specifically, for each command the proper local real time model is constructed and quickly analyzed to determine the effects on the power system. The analytics determine the effect of the command, if executed, on the system and in particular on the operational reliability of the system. In case of a command that may have adverse effects on the operational reliability of the system, the command will be blocked and the operator will be alerted. In addition to the command authentication at the relay level, an open-source real-time network monitoring system for capturing and parsing network traffic is presented. Because the method is based on the substation level dynamic state estimator which uses only local substation level measurements and data, a byzantine type attack is not considered possible for the proposed approach. Finally, a discussion on the architecture required to integrate the network monitoring and state estimation sys- ems is presented. The methodology is presently being tested in a laboratory setup that includes a digital simulator of the electric power system and hardware in the loop.","1530-1605;15301605","","","10.1109/HICSS.2015.320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070135","Dynamic State Estimation;PMU;Protection","Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Relays;State estimation;Substations","power engineering computing;power system management;power system reliability;public domain software;real-time systems;security of data;state estimation","command authentication;command interception;cyber intrusions;cyber security;dynamic state estimation;electric power system;fast authentication;hardware in the loop;open-source real-time network monitoring system;operational reliability;operational security;substation level distributed state estimation","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6;9780769540566","978-1-4244-7143-0;9781424471430","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2;9781467348652","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, anomaly detection in TCP/UDP networks has not been fully explored using the observation schemes. In this paper, we conduct comparative studies using NS-2 to evaluate performances of four sliding mode based observation schemes, namely, sliding mode observer (SMO), terminal sliding mode observer (TSMO), super twisting observer (STO) and fast terminal sliding observer (FTSMO), for anomaly detection in TCP/UPD networks.

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability.

However in the CPU based systems, pattern matching is one of the most computation intensive parts. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a regular expression string matching programmable controller (SMPC). This special purpose controller is a parallel and pipelined processor architecture which can deal with the regular expression semantics. Two hardware stacks are implemented in SMPC to support fast branches when the non-matching occurs. Our implementation processes 4 characters per clock cycle (maximum performance of state of the art solutions) and occupies only O(n) memory (where n is the length of the regular expression). Via synthesizing the verilog description and analyzing area/time constraints, SMPC can achieve 200~400 times speedup over traditional CPU implementations and up to 7.9Gbps in processing throughput. Besides it outperforms the counterparts greatly as the complexity of regular expressions increases.","1934-1768;19341768","978-1-4673-2581-3;9781467325813","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6390960","fast branch;regular expression;special purpose controller;string matching","Clocks;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Hardware;Pipelines;Protocols;Throughput","parallel processing;programmable controllers;security of data;string matching;unsolicited e-mail","CPU based system;SMPC controller;area-time constraints;network intrusion detection system;parallel processor architecture;pattern matching;pipelined processor architecture;processing throughput;programmable controller architecture;regular expression semantics;regular expression string matching;spam filtering;virus scanner","","0","","17","","","25-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","FVPATA;Fiedler nodes;Fiedler value;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;NS3;OLSR protocol;Puncture-Style Attacks;ad hoc network topology;collision avoidance;graph theory;health-care monitoring;optimized link state routing protocol;peer-to-peer communication;robotic agent;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network;vehicle accident;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Network function virtualization (NFV) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. NFV allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and present relationships between NFV and SDN.

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server. The results of the search techniques are compared to two hand-crafted solutions specified by experts.","","978-1-4244-8341-9;9781424483419","","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635154","autonomic computing;genetic algorithms;genetic programming;search based software engineering","Biological cells;Libraries;Monitoring;Phase measurement;Sensors;Software","fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;search problems","autonomic system;convex-hull geometric object;fault detection;genetic-algorithm;genetic-programming;multidimensional space;random-search approach;search method;software sensor","","2","","25","","","7-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

State-of-the-art NIDS uses deterministic finite automata (DFA) algorithms to perform regular expression matching for its stable matching speed. However, traditional DFA algorithm's throughput is limited by the input character's width (usually one character per time). Although the multi-stride method (process multiple characters per time) can increase the throughput, it leads the DFA transition table to an exponentially increased memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stride regular expression matching engine called PiDFA based on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It applies two methods to solve traditional multi-stride algorithms' memory explosion problem: DFA Transition Merging method and top-k state extraction method. Experiment results show that PiDFA achieves more than 30-fold better performance than original DFA algorithm. Whats more, PiDFA is orthogonal to existing transition table compression algorithms. Implemented with PiDFA algorithm, ClusterFA's matching speed is increased by 6-50 times while maintaining ClusterFA's low memory consumption.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511199","DFA;Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Regular Expression Matching","Clustering algorithms;Compression algorithms;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Merging;Throughput","deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;security of data","ClusterFA matching speed;DPI technology;FPGA;NIDS;PiDFA;deterministic finite automata algorithms;memory consumption;memory explosion problem;multistride method;multistride regular expression matching engine;networking intrusion detection system;top-k state extraction method","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, new members can join and current members can leave at any time. Instead of individual rekeying, i.e., performing a rekey right after each join or leave request is received, periodic batch rekeying has been proposed to alleviate rekeying overhead in resource-constrained wireless networks. The issue of how often rekey operations should be performed, however, has not been addressed. In this paper, we develop a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model to identify the optimal batch rekey interval to minimize periodic rekey overhead while satisfying application-specific constraints in rekey delay and secrecy violation. We develop three new threshold-based schemes, demonstrate the optimal rekey intervals for these three schemes, and identify the best scheme that should be adopted for periodic batch rekeying to minimize rekey overhead, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational and environmental conditions.","","0-7803-9305-8;0780393058","","10.1109/WIRLES.2005.1549463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549463","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Collaborative work;Computer science;Cryptography;Delay;Security;Stochastic processes;Teleconferencing;Wireless networks","Petri nets;optimisation;radio networks;stochastic processes;telecommunication security","application-specific constraints;batch rekey interval;dynamic network;group communications security;group membership;periodic rekey overhead minimization;rekey delay;resource-constrained wireless networks;secrecy violation;stochastic Petri net model","","0","","13","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","1","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern security systems that are applied in today's highly dynamic ICT networks, including malware scanners and intrusion detection systems, apply a kind of black-list approach, where they consider only actions and behavior that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces. We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior. We demonstrate the application of the system in a small-scale pilot case of a real utility provider.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816388","anomaly detection;event correlation;ict security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Malware;Privacy;SCADA systems;Smart grids","invasive software;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","Internet;access points;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection technique;attack patterns;black-list approach;electricity grid;intrusion detection systems;malware scanners;malware trace signatures;security level;security systems;smart grid ICT networks;smart white-list approach;system event tracking;utility provider","","2","","10","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides a whole new deployment model for enterprise web-applications. The cloud proposes significant cost cuts when compared to using an internal IT infrastructure. The ""pay for what you use"" model of cloud computing is significantly cheaper for a company than the ""pay for everything up front"" model of internal IT. Hardware Virtualization is the enabling technology behind many of the cloud infrastructure vendor offerings. Through virtualization, a physical server can be partitioned into any number of virtual servers running their own operating systems, in their allocated memory, CPU and disk footprints. From the perspective of the user or application on the virtual server, no indication exists to suggest that the server is not a real, physical server.

An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681;15228681","978-1-4673-5956-6;9781467359566","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","4","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station.

Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics.

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ad hoc network is at very early stage, but evolving fast. Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a kind of ad hoc network consists of mobile nodes connected through wireless technology. It is open, decentralized, low powered and dynamic in nature which makes it popular not only among the researchers but also among the attackers. The routing in MANET provides shorter path to reach destination, but that may not be the reliable one. So to make it reliable researchers have proposed various security mechanisms like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), secure routing protocols, firewalls etc. The Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) is one of the security schemes. In EAACK, the S-ACK mode successfully detects the malicious link in the network. But it declares both the nodes connecting or forming this link as malicious or misbehaving node. So to detect exact malicious node we are proposing an improved EAACK scheme. In proposed scheme we are making use of Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for improved security with reduced key size and with less computation.","","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7456941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456941","Ad hoc network;Digital Signature;EAACK;IDS;Improved EAACK;Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)","Mobile ad hoc networks;Receivers;Reliability;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","ECC;MANET;S-ACK mode;elliptic curve cryptography;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;improved EAACK scheme;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;secure routing protocols;wireless networks","","","","17","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"How dynamic is the ISPs address space? Towards internet-wide DHCP churn estimation","G. C. M. Moura; C. Ga&#x00F1;&#x00E1;n; Q. Lone; P. Poursaied; H.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","1","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The former three parts are used to form a secure transmission mechanism between the controller side and the plant side, which is responsible for enforcing the data confidentiality and checking the data integrity and authenticity. To guarantee the control system performance when suffering from deception attacks, the RNPC method based on round-trip time delays is proposed to compensate for the adverse effects introduced by the deception attacks as well as the network communication constraints, such as time-varying network delay, packet disorder and packet dropout. A theoretical result using the switched system theory is obtained for the closed-loop stability of the RNPC system.

Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays. In a multi-hop environment, these delays are compounded and may become unacceptably large.

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055;10952055","1-4244-0572-6;1424405726","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, inhibitors are capable of regulating this uncontrolled amplification by suppressing the reaction. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of these mechanisms in a network security scenario consisting of network monitoring elements, attack detection, and firewall devices. Previous work identified most existing detection approaches as not suitable for high-speed networks. This problem can be alleviated by separating the methodologies for network monitoring and for subsequent data analysis. In this paper, we present an adaptation algorithm that allows to manage the individual configuration parameters in order to optimize the overall system. We show the advantages of self-regulating techniques based on promoters and inhibitors that lead to maximized security and that gracefully degradate in case of overload situations.

These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7;9781467306737","978-1-4673-0672-0;9781467306720","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then offloads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA).

Differences in pixel intensity are calculated and compared with a fuzzy rule base to calculate edginess. This edginess measure is used to decide whether a pixel belongs to an edge or not. Features extracted from training videos train the Naive Bayesian Classifier which is then used for testing videos. Features are pre-processed using techniques such as Discretize, Fuzzy Logic, Numeric to Binary, PKI Discretize and Normalize. Then, they are filtered using Correlation Feature Selection before training the classifier.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA.

This paper demonstrates ontology based intrusion detection system for web application security. Context capture of information from links and scripts is the premise of the proposed system. The proposed IDS ontological model detects protocol specific attacks as well identifies malicious scripts. This model identifies types of attacks and vulnerabilities therein. A TCP dump of data on LAN was acquired and evaluated against KDD99 intrusion detection predictor model dataset. Ontology model was designed using Protégé.

Distribution of video and of live contents also experienced the P2P mechanisms with success. PPLive, UUSee and others have many of customers, hundreds of channels and thousands of concurrent users. However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks. The design of the system and the evaluation of a prototype showed good results and let us be optimistic about a possible deployment of P2P systems for video delivery, having the support of content providers as well as network operators.","","978-1-4244-6728-0;9781424467280","","10.1109/ICIW.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476763","P2P Video Streaming;legal contents;network-awareness;secure distribution;watermarking","Computer architecture;Design optimization;IP networks;Law;Legal factors;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Video sharing;Watermarking;Web and internet services","computer network security;content management;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;video streaming","P2P VoD system;P2P video system;content distribution;file sharing;network operator;peer-to-peer network;video delivery","","1","","20","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy.

An important step for the investigation or even prevention of these breaches is to normalize and analyze security-related log events from various systems in the target network. However, the number of log events produced in big IT landscapes can grow up to multiple billions per day. Current log management solutions, e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), cannot even closely normalize such huge amounts of data and therefore disable the tracking of attacks in real-time, which means that the log data remains unusable for attack analysis. In this paper, we present an approach to fully normalize event logs in high-speed by making use of established high-performance inter-thread messaging in conjunction with a hierarchical knowledge-base of log formats and parallel processing on multiple low-end systems. Using our approach, we are able to process more than 250,000 events/sec on relatively low-profile machines and can therefore easily handle more than 20 billion events/day, which is enough to handle average and peek loads of log events from big enterprise networks.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410270","event logs;inter-thread messaging;network security;normalization","Companies;Concrete;Instruction sets;Knowledge based systems;Parallel processing;Receivers;Security","parallel processing;security of data","IT landscapes;SIEM;big enterprise networks;distributed normalization;hierarchical knowledge-base;high-performance interthread messaging;instant attack analysis;log management solutions;low-profile machines;parallel normalization;parallel processing;real-time attack tracking;security breach prevention;security information and event management;security-related log event analysis","","","","18","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838227","","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Control systems;IP networks;Measurement;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","","","","30","","28","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337;23479337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","1","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927;10636927","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It incorporates alert aggregation, verification, and correlation components, which together provide for a clear and succinct view of potentially malicious activity.

To maximise the possibility of successful delivery to a destination, each node generates a table with a reliability index for each of its neighbour without performing neighbourspsila monitoring; based on that reliability value, sending/receiving traffic is prioritised. This work evaluates the effectiveness of REliable and Efficient Forwarding (REEF) using the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA), REEF-IDA; the conducted simulation shows that REEF-IDA outperforms REEF in which it increases the throughput of the network while it decreases both end-to-end delays and packet loss ratio.","","978-9927-486-02-0;9789927486020","978-9927-486-03-7;9789927486037","10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669844","Ad hoc networks;cross layering;information dispersal;mobility;network layer;packet forwarding;priority queuing;security","Data security;Dispersion;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Redundancy;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data forwarding security;end-to-end delays;information dispersal algorithm;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;neighbour monitoring;packet forwarding enhancement;packet loss ratio;reliability index;reliable-efficient forwarding;security research field;sending-receiving traffic","","0","","31","","","8-10 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"
"Maintaining throughput network connectivity in ad hoc networks","Y. Liu; A. Garnaev; W.

To cope with such interference, the paper introduces throughput connectivity and weighted throughput connectivity. Throughput connectivity reflects the possibility of establishing communication between nodes for given a signal power level, while weighted throughput connectivity associates the throughput as a weight in the associated network graph. Throughput connectivity is less sensitive to network's parameters than the one based on weighted throughput connectivity. It makes maintaining throughput connectivity protocol less resource consuming (say, by sending less frequently channel state information (CSI)). Whereas, weighted throughput protocol is more efficient in power allocation due to employing a continuous scale in Laplacian matrix. To illustrate these notions, two approaches to maximize connectivity were considered: (a) an adaptive transmission protocol that re-allocates transmission power between nodes, and (b) detecting and eliminating a malicious threat to maintain accumulated connectivity over time slots. The first problem was modeled by a maxmin problem, and solved by Semi-Definite Programming. The second problem was modeled by a stochastic game and solved explicitly.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7472905","Connectivity;Fiedler value;Jamming;Stochastic game;Throughput Connectivity","Adaptation models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Games;Interference;Laplace equations;Protocols;Throughput","ad hoc networks;game theory;mathematical programming;minimax techniques","Laplacian matrix;ad hoc networks;adaptive transmission protocol;maxmin problem;power allocation;semi-definite programming;stochastic game;throughput network connectivity protocol;weighted throughput protocol","","","","30","","","20-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the speed with which new technologies are introduced in the Web environment, system deployment life cycles have shrunk significantly-but so have system life spans. After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations. This case study describes the process our systems architecture team followed for designing and deploying the new architecture. I detail the component selection rationale, with implementation details where allowed. Ours is just one successful approach to deploying a. multisite, fully redundant Web-based system for a large organization; other reasonable and viable ways to build such a system also exist.","1089-7801;10897801","","","10.1109/MIC.2002.1036039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036039","","Added delay;Application software;Buildings;Computer architecture;Costs;Internet;Open source software;Programming;Service oriented architecture;Software systems","Internet;management of change;systems re-engineering","Web infrastructure;component selection;multisite fully redundant Web-based system;systems architecture","","0","1","8","","","Sep/Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This research introduced a parallel intrusion detection system based on GPGPU and Open Computing Language (OpenCL), that processes incoming packets concurrently, thus increasing system capacity in a high throughput environment. The experiment result shows that performance of GPU-based design is improved on the average of 58.73x against a single-thread central processing unit (CPU) implementation, and on the average of 13.53x against a multi-thread implementation.

In this paper, we propose a novel memory architecture using perfect hashing to condense state transition tables without hash collisions. The proposed memory architecture achieves up to 99.5% improvement in memory reduction compared to the traditional two-dimensional memory architecture.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is the basis of designing widely used routing protocols (example AODV). However, a node with malicious intentions can launch an attack on the network and disrupt its operations. Hence there is an utmost necessity of a mechanism to identify the attack and protect the system from the attackers. In this paper we present a method on providing security in MANET during route maintenance phase using Attacker Detection System (ADS) with the help of Honeypot (HP) and Attack History Database (AHD). The HP interacts with the attackers in order to know their motives and respond accordingly. The use of AHD helps HP in quick attack/attacker identification and crafting replies to attacker. We have simulated MANET with ADS and implemented it in sizes varying from 20 to 200 nodes in NS2. The results presented in paper conform to our claim on the efficiency of ADS in protecting MANET. Also the edge achieved in handling the attacker with the use of HoneyPots and Attack History Database is seen in results.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359424","Attack History database;HoneyPots;MANET;Route maintenance;Security","Databases;History;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV route maintenance;HoneyPots;MANET;attack history database;attack-attacker identification;attacker detection system;centralized network management;route establishment","","","","30","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, regular expressions are used, due to their high expressive power, and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are adopted to match them. Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-9266-4;9781424492664","978-1-4244-9267-1;9781424492671","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to optimize the performance of image transfer from multiple sensor nodes to the Sink we propose a 2-hop neighborhood information- based cover set selection to determine the most relevant cover sets. Then, in order to be consistent with our proposed approach, a multi-path extension of Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (called T-GPSR) wherein routing decisions are also based on 2-hop neighborhood information is proposed.

We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs. We evaluate this design through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.

Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","8","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2418434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090949","Data mining;insider attack;intrusion detection and protection;system call (SC);users' behaviors","Computers;Data mining;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-04-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules. The experimental results show that the pre-processing time for 50000 rules is shorter than 0.051s, the average speed of rule-header classification for Snort IDS is higher than 10 Gbps.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4673-5740-1;9781467357401","978-1-4673-5741-8;9781467357418","10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496433","Binary tree;FPGA;NIDS;Packet classification","Binary trees;Clocks;Decision trees;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks","IP networks;computer network security;parallel processing;pattern classification;pipeline processing;telecommunication network routing;tree data structures","CPU;FPGA;IP packet;NIDS;Snort IDS;binary tree structure;binary-tree-based high speed packet classification system;hardware circuit;high performance embedded networking application;network intrusion detection system;next-generation packet classification;packet header division;parallel processing;pipeline processing;processor performance;router;rule-header classification;serial program execution;software-based packet classification;tree node","","2","","10","","","28-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","5","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Most existing works focus on actively detecting malicious nodes by verifying signal correlation or behavior consistency. It may not work well in large-scale social networks since the number of users is extremely large and the difference between normal users and malicious users is inconspicuous. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: full information and partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem. We perform extensive simulations to validate the analysis and demonstrate the impact of system factors on the overall cost.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2560518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462258","crowdsourcing;largescale networks.;malicious users detection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Incentive schemes;Internet of things;Optimization;Sensors;Social network services","","","","","","","","2016-04-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured. This study focuses on building a product-like security gateway and on evaluating its performance.

The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

The traffic analysis capability also need to be scaled up correspondingly to handle this high traffic rates. The modern commodity platforms equipped with processors rich in number of cores and having hyper threading technology has enabled emergence of software based solutions rather than dedicated platforms for traffic analysis. But the general purpose network stacks provided by operating systems focus more on compatibility and hence are not able to fully exploit the hardware capabilities of these platforms. Lot of work is reported on customizing the stack for packet capture and achieving line rate (10 Gbps) performance on a single Network Interface Card (NIC). Some work is also reported on use of multiple 10GbE NICs for handling traffic beyond 10 Gbps. This paper brings out through experimental setup and observations the issues involved in linear scaling of performance with additional NICs on commodity Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) servers. It shows that linear scaling requires optimum configurations of compute, memory and network resources especially affinity of NICs to NUMA nodes. Using these configurations we are able to achieve linear scaling of traffic analysis capability with additional 10 GbE NICs. We report scaled performance upto 40 Gbps with the use of four NIC cards.","","978-1-4799-6870-1;9781479968701","","10.1109/ICDSE.2014.6974636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974636","Commodity Servers;Linear Scaling;Multiple NICs;Traffic Capture;beyond 10 Gbps","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Hardware;Program processors;Servers","network interfaces;telecommunication traffic","Internet users;NIC;NUMA nodes;commodity NUMA servers;commodity nonuniform memory access servers;compute resource;general purpose network stacks;hyper threading technology;line rate performance;linear performance scaling;memory resource;multiple network interface cards;network resource;network traffic rate;operating systems;optimum configurations;packet capture;single network interface card;software based solutions;traffic analysis capability;traffic capture","","0","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate. In fact, our system can recognize attacks in a constant time.","","978-1-4799-3022-7;9781479930227","","10.1109/IACS.2014.6841978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841978","Host sweep;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network probe attack;Port scan;TDNN neural network","IP networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification","HIDS;NIDS;TDNN neural network structure;alert module;attack behavior classification;computer security systems;host sweep attacks;host-based intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection system;network probe attacks;packet capture engine;pattern classification;pattern recognition;port scan attacks;preprocessor;reconnaissance attacks;unauthorized accesses","","2","","26","","","1-3 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789;08407789","978-1-4244-5376-4;9781424453764","978-1-4244-5377-1;9781424453771","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Changes to satisfy telecommunication needs within the technical community have surfaced gradually through the efforts of international computer standards organizations, technical panels, and guidance committees. The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another example of a security ap- - pliance. This network device employs security mechanisms such as tunneling, Internet protocol (IP) security protocols and cryptography.

Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.","1063-6404;10636404","978-1-4244-2657-7;9781424426577","978-1-4244-2658-4;9781424426584","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855","","Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory","","2","","25","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated.

In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2;9781424490042","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).","0840-7789;08407789","978-1-4799-5827-6;9781479958276","","10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395","Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole","","0","","20","","","3-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.","","1-4244-0800-8;1424408008","1-4244-0801-6;1424408016","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146353","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Entropy;Information systems;Intrusion detection;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;security of data;telecommunication security","feature selection;lightweight intrusion detection model;maximum entropy model;network intrusion detection system","","3","","8","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OppNets exploit the characteristics of the human social, such as similarities, daily routines, mobility patterns and interests to perform the message routing and data sharing. Packet dropping attack is one of the hardest attacks in Opportunistic Networks as both the source nodes and the destination nodes have no knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a new malicious nodes detection technique against packet faking attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and instead of them injects new fake packets. We have called this novel attack in our previous works a packet faking attack. Each node in Opportunistic Networks can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, hash chain techniques. In our hash chain based defense techniques we have two phases. The first phases is to detect the attack, and the second phases is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature.

Protocol scrubbers are transparent, active interposition mechanisms for explicitly removing network scans and attacks at various protocol layers. The transport scrubber supports downstream passive network-based intrusion detection systems by converting ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream end-points. The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks - attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection - on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance. The TCP scrubber is based on a novel, simplified state machine that performs in a fast and scalable manner. The fingerprint scrubber is built upon the TCP scrubber and removes additional ambiguities from flows that can reveal implementation-specific details about a host's operating system","","0-7695-1212-7;0769512127","","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932163","","Banking;Business;Computer security;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","network operating systems;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP scrubber;ambiguities;ambiguous network flows;detection subversion;downstream passive network-based intrusion detection systems;evasion attacks;fingerprint scrubber;host operating system determination;implementation-specific details;insertion attacks;network attacks;network scans;network security;passive network-based intrusion detection systems;performance;protected host;protocol scrubbers;state machine;transparent active interposition mechanisms;transparent flow modification;transport scrubber","","4","1","25","","","2001","12 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique.

However, the trustworthiness of these data is crucial as false information can heavily affect the performance of applications. Hence, the devising of mechanisms that reassure the integrity of the exchanged data is of utmost importance. In this article we investigate how tweaked information originating from malicious nodes can affect the performance of a real time eco-routing mechanism that uses Dedicated Short Ranged Communications (DSRC), namely Erou Ve. We improve the routing decision mechanism of the original algorithm and also develop and evaluate defense mechanisms that exploit vehicular communications in order to filter out tweaked data.

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9;9781479964529","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","4","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we selectively cap the packet payload to reduce write speed and storage requirements on hard drives and further reduce the computational burden of packet analysis. The proposed techniques take advantage of most packet payloads being useless for analysis purposes, because they are either encrypted or in a proprietary application non-readable format. Conversely, non-ASCII packets from well-known protocols and protocols with some ASCII data are fully captured as they may be potentially useful for network analysis. We have named this approach as selective capping, and we have implemented and integrated it into a high-speed network driver and a software module at user level, to make its operation more transparent and faster to upper layer applications.

We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework.

However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated.

The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction.

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059537","Bayes rule;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE);secure routing;strategy","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Mobile computing;Receivers;Routing protocols","Bayes methods;cryptographic protocols;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANETs;PBE strategy;anonymous behaviors;belief updating systems;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;game theory model;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;regular nodes;reputation system;secure routing protocol;security attacks","","0","","","","","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The detection of the causes of defects may possibly lead to an improvement in production. However, the production records generally contain an enormous set of features. It is almost impossible in practice to monitor all features at once. This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy. In addition, with MapReduce on the cloud, the performance can be increased by 17.5 times.","1521-9097;15219097","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2013.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6808251","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Manufacturing Data;MapReduce;k-Nearest Neighbor","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Manufacturing;Monitoring;Testing","genetic algorithms;manufacturing data processing;pattern classification;security of data","MapReduce GA;anomaly detection;feature reduction technique;genetic algorithm;k-nearest neighborhood classifier;kNN;manufacturing data;production records","","1","","14","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern networks expand and operate at high speeds, which is why handling all network traffic without overlooking security issues is difficult for IDS that run on a single processor. In this paper, we proposed a shared memory design called Hybrid Multi-Pattern Algorithm (HMA) as extension of our previous work, multi-core based HMA.

As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP/IP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time.

The configuration for FPGA chips is automatically generated by a configuration program according to the user's definition of the monitored values in order to save hardware resources and increase the throughput.

Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors. The technique has been successfully applied to detect attacks against widely-deployed applications, including the Apache Web server and the OpenSSH server.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377227","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Computer science;Computer security;Data mining;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","Internet;digital signatures;operating system kernels;program debugging;security of data;software maintenance","Apache Web server;OpenSSH server;application-level auditing;application-level bugs;application-logic errors;application-specific signatures;binary rewriting;buffer overflows;host security;intrusion detection systems;legacy systems;offline language tool;operating system kernel;syslog entries;system calls","","1","2","38","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed.

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the ""Search"" phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.","","978-0-7695-2858-9;9780769528589","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321","","Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system","","0","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4799-8466-4;9781479984664","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we introduce FloTracker that is an online log-free host-based root-cause analysis detection engine, with instantaneous forensics capabilities. FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","1530-2075;15302075","1-4244-0909-8;1424409098","1-4244-0910-1;1424409101","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MRM utilizes hardware RAM modules to share matching signals and exploits hardware register counting to implement constrained repetitions. This paper also proposes a software compiler to construct the hardware architecture and generate information in MRM's RAMs for the given regular expressions.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","38","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This processing involves traversing a linked list and invoking a matching function for each item. Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability.

As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

To address the above issue, a two-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Depending on the definition of relevant feature and redundant feature and using mutual information as criterion, it firstly eliminates the irrelevant features and then eliminates the redundant features. With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold. Experiments over networks connection records from authoritative data set KDD CUP 1999 were implemented for several detection algorithms to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the algorithm could effectively select features, ensure detection accuracy and improve processing speed.","","978-0-7695-3615-6;9780769536156","","10.1109/JCAI.2009.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159080","feature selection;intrusion detection;mutual information","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Computer vision;Data engineering;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Mutual information;Software algorithms;Training data","computational complexity;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis","KDD;authoritative data set;intrusion detection;machine learning;mutual information;network connection record;statistical analysis;time complexity;two-step feature selection algorithm","","2","","9","","","25-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","12","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6;9781424422326","978-1-4244-2233-3;9781424422333","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-6695-5;9781424466955","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","6","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks.

In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC.

Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious. In this article, we investigate the state-of-the-art of security issues in MANET.

Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4673-1796-2;9781467317962","978-0-7695-4713-8;9780769547138","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","6","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Depending on the complexity of the firewall ruleset, filtering performance of the IDS can decrease considerably during high-load flooding situations. In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules to limit the number of firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed.

Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future.

In many-to-one communication the adversary attracts its surrounding neighbor nodes with false routing information and fake identities. The existing researches have focused on single layer attacks. In their work they target only one specific layer and detect the attack, without considering other layers into account. Our proposed detection technique maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross layer features and Mobile agent based approach in two phases. In first phase, attacks are detected by correlating the cross layer features such as MAC and Network layers. During second phase, if the attacks are detected, mobile agent based technique is applied to prevent the attack. Here the data is forwarded through the mobile agent. The mobile agent solves the security problem by using three step negotiations. Through this mobile agent based approach, the false positive rate can be reduced and improving the energy efficiency than the existing approach.","","","","10.1109/ICICES.2016.7518935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518935","Cross layer;Mobile agent;Security;Sinkhole attack;Sybil attack","Base stations;Cross layer design;Feature extraction;Mobile agents;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","25-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results. Overall, the proposed approach is able to consistently detect intrusions and does not introduce any additional false positives.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066523","encrypted network;intrusion detection;malicious proxy;secret-sharing","Availability;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","cryptography;probability;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","NIDS;Shamir's secret-sharing scheme;VPN;encrypted network traffic;malicious activity detection;network-based intrusion detection system;probability;virtual private network","","2","","10","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2.

By examining each packet flowing through a network segment, suspicious packets are detected and reported to assure security. Up to 57% of the execution time in a NIDS is found to compare string against a predefined/known pattern. It is hard to implement a multi-gigabit performance NIDS without hardware support. This paper proposes a very high speed string matching algorithm which can be easily implemented into FPGAs.

The traditional way for intrusion prevention is done by pure software solution with high performance CPU. However, this method is out of date, when gigabit network is booming and the high performance throughput is required. In recent years, the programmable hardware solutions have been proposed but they cannot deal with deep and large amount of pattern matching and are lack of flexibility when signatures are growing up. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-matching coprocessor that overcomes the difficulties in TCAM implementation when pattern length is deep and signature set is large.

While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These types of WSN rely on cluster heads for data aggregation and transmission towards sink node. Subsequently cluster head nodes are outfitted with high energy. Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8;9781479998548","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1;9781467318891","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","2","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The compromise of one computer puts the entire network at risk. We propose a distributed personal intrusion detection system (IDS) that provides local anomaly detection as well as centralized traffic analysis. The system first builds profiles for normal network activity and then labels as suspicious any events that deviate from the normal profiles. The normal profiles are based on variations in connection-based behavior at each individual host. Deviations at each host are recorded using a local weight assignment scheme and then further processed by the central analyzer to build a weighted link graph representing the overall network abnormality.

To enhance security, various trust-based schemes have been proposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However, most of them use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection, without taking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high false positives, low malicious node detection rate, and network partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) computation strategy, that adapts the trust threshold in the routing protocol according to network conditions such as rate of link changes, node degree and connectivity, and average neighborhood trustworthiness. We identify the topology factors that affect the trust threshold at each node, and leverage them to build a mathematical model for ATT computation. Our simulation results indicate that the ATT strategy achieves significant improvements in packet delivery ratio, reduction in false positives, and increase in detection rate as compared to traditional static threshold strategies.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345347","MANETs;Trust-based security;adaptive threshold;static threshold;threshold computation","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Measurement;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Security","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","ATT computation strategy;MANETs;adaptive trust threshold strategy;cryptography-based security schemes;distributed architecture;dynamic network topology;high false positive reduction;low malicious node detection rate;mathematical model;misbehaving node detection;misbehaving node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;network partitioning;packet delivery ratio;predefined trust thresholds;routing protocol;static threshold strategy;trust-based schemes","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes.

The ultimate aim of these schemes is to provide the necessary security cover to the network by adding encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns.

Unfortunately, a significant number of them are purchased by world-wide networks of ticket purchasing robots run by scalpers looking to turn a quick profit. Ticket outlets currently employ CAPTCHAs to slow down fully automated purchasing robots. Since the profit associated with scalping tickets is several orders of magnitude larger than the cost associated with paying humans to solve the CAPTCHAs, this approach has been ineffective. CAPTCHAs have a fundamental flaw when used to protect online tickets: the cost to solve them using humans is fixed and small. To address this problem, this paper explores a novel alternative based on geographically-driven proof-of-work. The crux of the approach exploits the observation that most legitimate clients are located geographically close to the event. By requiring every client to solve a cryptographic puzzle whose difficulty is based on their distance to the event, ticket purchasing robots must be placed close to each event in order to monopolize the tickets. This requirement significantly increases the cost of operating such networks. Using emulation and simulation, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in tackling the online ticketing problem.","","978-1-4244-6739-6;9781424467396","978-1-4244-6739-6;9781424467396","10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466663","","Communications Society;Costs;Cryptography;Databases;Emulation;Humans;Marketing and sales;Protection;Robotics and automation;Robots","Internet;marketing data processing;security of data","CAPTCHA;TicketMaster;cryptographic puzzle;geographic proof-of-work;online ticket protection;scalping tickets;ticket purchasing robots","","1","","23","","","15-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We refer to this jamming-assisted data control threat as hammer and anvil attack. We model a prototype of the hammer and anvil attack in a wireless sensor network scenario with distributed cross-layer routing protocols.

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2537331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423661","Static-sensor networks;mobile-target detection;optimal deployment","Genetic algorithms;Mobile communication;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking","object detection;sensors","dynamic approach;expanding search areas;mobile-target detection;natural terrain variation;on-line reconfigurability;sensor network deployment;static-sensor network;unstructured search areas","","","","63","","2016-03-02","June1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates.

More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity.

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605;15301605","978-0-7695-3450-3;9780769534503","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

Open medium, wide distribution and de-centralization of nodes makes MANETs vulnerable and malicious. It is crucial to develop efficient intrusion detection system to protect MANETs. A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism.

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

As a consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy consumed by the device. In this perspective, this paper aims to spot malware covertly exchanging data using two detection methods based on artificial intelligence tools, such as neural networks and decision trees.

This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process.

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","2159-3442;21593442","0-7803-9311-2;0780393112","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks damage trust with the received data from a sensor node. One such type of attack is the false data injection attack. The message is forged by the adversary, not detected by the forwarding nodes as false information. Compromised node is the origin of false data to be injected in to the WSN. The proposed work discards the false data injected message from the network. This issue of compromised node is handled by the detection and elimination of it from causing further damage to the network by incorporating Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique for data authentication to any message received.

Open-Flow as a major API for SDN applies <;match, action> rules to every packet. However, it only supports a few actions that are all predefined. We extend this limitation of OpenFlow and propose User-Defined Actions (UDAs) for SDN. We discuss usecases of UDAs and propose an architecture to realize UDAs. Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","978-1-4244-7628-2;9781424476282","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture.

The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient.

Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot.

Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one. This means that the presented implementation architecture is immune to algorithmic complexity attacks","","0-7695-2565-2;0769525652","","10.1109/DEPCOS-RELCOMEX.2006.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024042","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;Databases;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","cryptography;invasive software;string matching","IT security safeguards;Karp-Rabin algorithm;Snort IPS signatures;Witty worm;algorithmic complexity attacks;denial of service attacks;hash tables;network intrusion prevention system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;resource-efficient string matching algorithm;time-efficient string matching algorithm","","4","1","28","","","25-27 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","2325-5552;23255552","0-7803-9569-7;0780395697","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","17","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","Application software;Availability;Computer architecture;Information systems;Internet;Open systems;Protection;Resilience;Service oriented architecture;Web server","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","13","","27","","2008-02-02","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities. Next, we use the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to fuse the outputs provided by the above locally executed algorithms at different nodes, thus forming a collaborative intrusion detection system.

The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2;9781424427772","978-1-4244-2778-9;9781424427789","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","23","3","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The comparison between statistic characters of total messages traffic and the samples in a large-scale network decides whether the sampIes are precise and efficient.

Due to the distance, mobility, behavior of nodes in the networks and dynamic in nature, it is essential to provide security for all the networks separately or distributed. Various existing approaches discuss about the security issues and challenges for heterogeneous networks. In this paper a Leader Based Intrusion Detection System [LBIDS] is proposed to detect and prevent DOS as well as other attacks such as Sybil and Sinkhole in the networks by deploying the Leader Based Intrusion Detection System into access points in the networks. The proposed approach utilizes three core security challenges such as Authentication, positive incentive provision and preventing DOS. In addition to that it will do packet verification and IP verification for improving the efficiency in terms of detection and prevention against attacks in heterogeneous networks.

The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed.

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","2","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not.

A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency.

Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware.

The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.","0018-9286;00189286","","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790","Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack","Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon","computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks","","2","","19","","2014-08-28","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210;10638210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in the face of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection. We also discuss our implementation of the UMIP model for Linux using the Linux Security Modules framework, and show that it is simple to configure, has low overhead, and effectively defends against a number of network-based attacks.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2848-1;0769528481","","10.1109/SP.2007.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223222","","Access control;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Permission;Power system security;Protection;Usability","Linux;authorisation;systems analysis","Linux security module framework;mandatory usable access control system;network-based attack;operating system;usable mandatory integrity protection","","10","","24","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678;15450678","978-1-4673-1423-7;9781467314237","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9;9781479941919","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases. Our techniques can be applied to database systems to provide multizone isolations with different levels of QoS.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412980","","Application software;Computer science;Computer security;Database systems;Delay;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","SQL;data integrity;quality of service;query processing;security of data;transaction processing","SQL injections;SQL queries;data corruption attacks;database filtering;database isolation;database system transactions;integrity level;intrusion detections systems;quality of service;recovery cost reduction;sequential analysis;uniform processing latency;unsafe zone","","1","","18","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;game theory-based energy-theft detection;security vulnerabilities;smart grid proliferation;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;utility companies","","9","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS.

In addition, we tested the products under two different operating systems. Several experiments were run to evaluate the effects of open source intrusion detection and prevention systems Snort and Suricata, operating systems Windows, Linux and various attack types on system resource usage, dropped packets rate and ability to detect intrusions. The results show that Suricata has a higher CPU and RAM utilization than Snort in all cases on both operating systems, but lower percentage of dropped packets when evaluated during five of six simulated attacks. Both products had the same number of correctly identified intrusions. The results show that Linux-based solutions consume more system resources, but Windows-based systems had a higher rate of dropped packets. This indicates that these two intrusion detection and prevention systems should be run on Linux.

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","10.1145/1185347.1185372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Engines;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Software","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","1","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead.

For intrusion detection method based support vector machine (SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it's impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance.

Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The optimal power-allocation algorithm is developed under the constraints that 1) each user satisfies individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement for successful heterogeneous communication, 2) the sum of transmit power allocated to each user is equal to the permissible total transmit power at the smart meter, and 3) the allocated transmit power to each user is feasible. The optimization problem is mathematically shown to be convex, and the optimal power allocation is thus derived. By employing the theorem that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables follows Erlang distribution, the probability distribution function (pdf) of the smallest allocated transmit power is mathematically obtained from the properties of downlink indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channels. It is analytically shown that the allocated transmit power has a lower limit, which is determined by the SINR threshold and the total number of active users in the HAN. Furthermore, numerical results verify the capacity performance improvements of the proposed optimal power-allocation scheme.

So it is an important issue that how to make the IP networks to be more resilient under faults and attacks, i.e., to improve their tolerance abilities for both fault and intrusion. However recently, most of the researches focus on only one of them, and decouple the survivability and security each other. According to the trust model in social networks, this paper proposes an efficient scheme which is resilient to both fault and intrusion based on trust relationship for IP networks.

IEEE","20100304","2009","","","1","6","Local monitoring has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for mitigating security attacks in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality. We show through analysis and simulation that the basic local monitoring (BLM) fails to efficiently mitigate stealthy power control attacks while MPC successfully mitigates them.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425559","","Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power control;Protocols;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;power control;protocols;security of data;wireless channels","MPC;basic local monitoring;malicious behavior;mitigating security attacks;mitigating stealthy power control attacks;multihop ad-hoc networks;partial neighborhood communication;protocol;stealthy packet dropping;wireless ad hoc networks","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2;9789639799592","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","1","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern match algorithm plays an important role in NIDS that performs searches against multiple patterns for a string match. Pattern matching is a computationally expensive task. Traditional software-based NIDS solutions usually can not achieve a high-speed required for ever growing Internet attacks. In order to satisfy high-speed packet content inspection, hardware-implementable pattern match algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based pattern match architecture that employs a multi-character processor array. The proposed multi-character processor array is a parallel and pipelined architecture which can process multiple characters of the input stream per cycle. The proposed architecture can reduce a lot of unnecessary computations and thus it is power efficient. We use snort pattern sets and DEFCON packet traces to perform our simulations.

The design and implementation of our WLAN-based AVI system was based on reducing the identification time in order to cover high-speed cars. As time is required to establish a network connection between a roadside access point and a car station, identifying a high-speed car by communicating through that network connection is not feasible. We utilize IEEE 802.11 management frame such as probe request frame in order to identify a station without establishing a network connection. We also control the timing of the scanning procedure in order to generate enough frames for reliable identification of high speed-cars. Based on the experimental results, our WLAN-based AVI system achieves an identification ratio of nearly 100% for various car speeds ranging from 40 km/h to 100 km/h, whereas, active RFID, one of the representative technologies for AVI, does not show reliable identification performance, especially at high-speeds.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284110","AVI;IVCS;VANET;Vehicle Identification;Vehicular Network;WLAN","Vehicles","automated highways;automobiles;telecommunication network management;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 management frame;WLAN-based automatic vehicle identification;electronic toll collection;roadside access point;smart car;vehicular terminal device;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation.

A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network.

An SMM is expected to produce correct outcomes while scanning the input data at high rates. Furthermore the string sets that are searched for are usually large and their sizes increase steadily. Bloom Filters (BFs) are hashing data structures which are fast but their false positive results require further processing. That is, their speed can be exploited for Standard Bloom Filter SMMs (SBFs) as long as the positive probability is low. Multiple BFs in parallel can further increase the throughput. In this paper, we propose the Double Bloom Filter SMM (DBF) which achieves a higher throughput than the SBF and maintains a high throughput even for large positive probabilities. The second Bloom Filter of DBF stores a small enough subset of the positive strings such that its false positive probability is approximately zero. We develop an analytical model of the DBF and show that the throughput advantage of DBF over SBF becomes more prominent if the positive probability and the fraction of matches in the second Bloom Filter increase. Accordingly, we propose a heuristic algorithm that stores the strings that are more frequently matched in the second Bloom Filter according to localities identified in the input. Our numerical results are obtained using realistic values from an FPGA implementation and are validated by SystemC simulations.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2577033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485864","Bloom filter;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate array (FPGA);string matching","Analytical models;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Matched filters;Metadata;Throughput;Time factors","","","","","","","","2016-06-06","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper proposes RocketTC, a scalable FPGA-based architecture, to accelerate traffic classification while maintaining high accuracy. It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform. Our results show a sustained throughput of over 20 Gbps for minimum packet size of 40 bytes, and high accuracy above 97% for classifying nearly a hundred popular applications.

However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely ""attack signature"", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2;9780769535012","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

An efficient pattern matching algorithm plays an important role in NIDS. There have been many proposed methods for pattern matching algorithms. Traditionally, the multi-character NFA that is capable of matching multiple characters per cycle can be built by duplicating entire circuit of 1-character architecture. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing based architecture to improve the original multi-character architecture. The design of the proposed architecture and its implementation in FPGA are described in details. Our simulation results show that the proposed architecture performs better than all the existing Brute-Force based approaches in terms of the throughput and the slice utilization. Specifically, the proposed architectures of 2-character and 4-character designs can achieve the throughputs of 4.68 and 7.27 Gbps and the slice utilization of 2.86 and 2.10 in terms of char/slice, respectively.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-6695-5;9781424466955","","10.1109/AINA.2010.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474723","Finite state machine;Intrusion detection;Multi-character;Pattern matching","Application software;Automata;Clocks;Computer architecture;Costs;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput","Internet;computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;pattern matching","Brute-Force;FPGA;NFA pattern matching architecture;Network Intrusion Detection System;bit rate 4.68 Gbit/s to 7.27 Gbit/s;deterministic finite automata;field programmable gate array;finite state machines;network attacks detection;network intrusion detection system;original multicharacter architecture","","1","","16","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the biggest trends has been social media services such as Facebook and Twitter. Although social media is the major trend, it is not the only one. Cloud computing has made a large impact on the computing industry in recent years. Whether being utilized to provide highly scalable robust environments for applications or just being used as a marketing ploy, one thing is certain: cloud computing has the potential to yet again change the way we interact with computer systems. There is just one major factor separating cloud computing from becoming widely accepted both personally and commercially and that is security. As cloud systems re-innovate ways of request distribution and load balancing, it is important to test these systems against attacks such as the denial of service attack. There is a strong emphasis on researching these attacks since cloud computing is re-inventing the payment systems in which consumers utilize resources. This paper examines the Google App Engine and its resilience to denial of service attacks. Further the paper demonstrates the strain such an attack has on the servers that facilitate the services and finally discuss the preventative measures set in place by Google and how they are only temporary solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069370","Cloud Computing;Cloud Computing Security;Denial of Service;Google App Engine;Network Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Databases;Engines;Google;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;social networking (online)","Facebook;Google App Engine;Internet;Twitter;cloud computing;denial of service attacks;load balancing;request distribution;social media services","","0","","8","","","16-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, to improve the current mitigation solution, this study intents to proposethe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the mitigation rules approach to mitigate the ICMP attack. The mitigation rules are developed specifically to mitigate the ICMP attack and to suppress the number of false alarms. Project implementation is done using Snort, which is installed in the Linux platform. For evaluation purpose, testing is carried out with live private data in identical environment, with the default rules and the proposed mitigation rules enabled in the same LAN.

Specifically we perform anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529343","privacy-enhanced security data sharing","Access control;Automation;Collaboration;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Pattern analysis;Protection;Risk analysis","data privacy;security of data","anonymized packet traces;distributed security analysis;intrusion detection system alarms;network data;privacy protection;security analysis capability","","0","","32","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","2155-5486;21555486","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339","","Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic","Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic","","1","3","9","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this scenario, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate and compare automaton models and the data-structures that materialize them. We also adapt state-of-the-art memory layouts to better fit in today's computer architectures. Finally, we apply our methodology to most important automaton models, memory layouts, and well-known signature sets.

This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357562","HTTP;TCP;big data;chat;documents;email;insider threat;machine learning;support vector machine;trust;usage patterns","Access control;Big data;Computer security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Monitoring","Big Data;authorisation;data analysis;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trusted computing","BBAC;English text exchanges;HTTP requests;actor trustworthiness;behavior-based access control;big data analytics;big data batch processing;chat messages;classifier training;clustering analysis;document trustworthiness;emails;enterprise environments;information trustworthiness;insider threat detection;interconnected systems;machine learning;mal-behavior;network connections;real-time stream processing;security events;statistical classification","","","","37","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common trend in the evaluation of NIDS is to use a narrow selection of publicly or privately available rule-sets and traffic. Private rule-sets and traffic make the repeatability of experiments difficult while publicly available rule-sets and traffic often lack the diversity to explore the NIDS's true operating range. This can cause misleading results in the face of inputs that do not adequately test the NIDS. To improve diversity and provide better context for evaluations it is necessary to employ synthesized traffic and rules in addition to the use of public or private traffic and rule-sets. This research expands on previous models and tools to provide systematic means for increasing the diversity and context of any evaluation providing for a broader perspective from which to view NIDS performance and compare results.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417740","","Automata;Context;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Market research;Ports (Computers);Privacy","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance evaluation;diversity improvement;network intrusion detection system evaluation;private traffic;privately available rule-set selection;public traffic;publicly available rule-set selection","","","","19","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","32","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/65.283931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=283931","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems","computer networks;network operating systems;open systems;security of data;telecommunication network management","abuse;audit trails;heterogeneous computer networks;host-based IDS;intruder behavior;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;monitored network traffic;network-based IDS;open mode;rulebased misuse models;security;statistical anomaly;unauthorized actions;unauthorized use","","163","81","36","","","May-June 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","J. T. L. Ho; G. G. F. Lemieux","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2;9781424437832","978-1-4244-2796-3;9781424427963","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","3","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a distributed scheme that can mitigate the damage caused by DDoS through a coordinated detection and response framework. This proposed scheme composes of a number of heterogeneous defense systems which cooperate with each other in protecting Internet servers. We have set up a network testbed for carrying out extensive experiments using real server machines, routers and software attack tools. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme can greatly improve the throughput of legitimate traffic and reduce the attack traffic during DDoS attacks.

Consumer electronic devices have evolved depending on user needs. Users want to use compact and portable devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. anywhere and at anytime to download multimedia data or to access realtime traffic. The mobile Ad Hoc networks have several salient characteristics, such as Dynamic topologies, Bandwidth-constrained, Variable capacity links, Energy-constrained operation and Limited physical security. Due to these features, mobile Ad Hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks launched through compromised node. The communication in mobile AdHoc networks comprises of two phases, the route discovery and the data transmission. In a hostile environment, adversarial nodes can try to disrupt communication in both the two phases. However, consumer electronic devices generally operate on limited battery power and therefore are vulnerable to security threats like data flooding attacks. Flooding attack is a novel and powerful attack against on-demand Ad Hoc routing protocols. At present, FAP (Flooding Attack Prevention) is the single scheme proposed to resist such attack. But it may not give quality of service. In this paper, we present a Period Based Defense mechanism against data flooding attack in wireless AdHoc network. This is the new technique to defend the flooding attack. This scheme is based on the periods and uses a blacklist to efficiently prevent the data flooding attack. The main aim of this paper is to enhance the throughput of burst traffic. As a result of which, many data packets are forwarded at a high rate for the whole duration. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the throughput of burst traffic.","","978-1-4799-3925-1;9781479939251","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726662","Data flooding attack;burst traffic;throughput;wireless ad hoc network","Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PDA;adversarial nodes;bandwidth-constrained variable capacity links;battery power;burst traffic;cellular phones;compromised node;consumer electronic devices;data flooding attacks;data packets;data transmission;denial of service attacks;dynamic topologies;energy-constrained operation;flooding attack prevention;hostile environment;laptop computers;limited physical security;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile users;multimedia data;on-demand ad hoc routing protocols;period based defense mechanism;personal digital assistants;quality of service;realtime traffic;route discovery;security threats;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","5","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many intrusion detection systems have been proposed and most of them are tightly related to routing protocols, such as Watchdog/Pathrater and Routeguard. These solutions include two parts: intrusion detection (Watchdog) and response (Pathrater and Routeguard). Watchdog resides in each node and is based on overhearing. Through overhearing, each node can detect the malicious action of its neighbors and report other nodes. However, if the node that is overhearing and reporting itself is malicious, then it can cause serious impact on network performance. In this paper, we overcome the weakness of Watchdog and introduce our intrusion detection system called ExWatchdog. The main feature of the proposed system is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network. Simulation results show that our system decrease the overhead greatly, though it does not increase the throughput obviously.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288867","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communications Society;Computer networks;Information science;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","Pathrater;Routeguard;Watchdog;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless ad hoc networks;routing protocols","","17","","11","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive firewall system in collaboration with DNS (Domain Name System) which introduces querier's IP address notification feature. With such a feature, the proposal system can identify whether each communication flow can be trusted or not by checking the querier's IP address and the DNS query target domain name. Then based on the result of checking, the firewall system adaptively decides specific operation for specific connection. Consequently, the trusted flows go through bypass route of higher bandwidth without heavy packet inspection while untrusted flows will be blocked or restricted by strict packet inspection. Thus, the firewall system totally accomplishes higher throughput.","","978-1-4577-0531-1;9781457705311","978-0-7695-4423-6;9780769544236","10.1109/SAINT.2011.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004157","DNS;Firewall System;Load Balancing","Collaboration;IP networks;Inspection;Proposals;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;computer network security","DNS query target domain name;IP address notification;Internet services;adaptive firewall system;domain name system;extended DNS;network security;packet inspection","","0","1","6","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Sui Song; C. N. Manikopoulos","","2006 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","1","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the challenges in programming such architectures, realizing this promise has proved to be difficult. In this paper, we describe the design of Lagniappe, a programming environment that simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-* architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification - expressed using a model-driven development framework - of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-* platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317815","","Computer architecture;Computer graphics;Dynamic programming;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Process design;Programming environments;Service oriented architecture;Virtual private networks;Web server","message passing;multiprogramming;object-oriented languages;programming environments;software portability","Lagniappe;declarative specification;high-throughput applications;hybrid programming model;model-driven development framework;multi-* architectures;multi-threaded architectures;multiprocessor;multiprogramming;portable application;procedural specification;programming environment;target hardware platform","","0","","28","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a context of high traffic with heavy tailed characteristics, static rules for dispatching traffic slices among distributed sensors cause severe imbalance. Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4;0769529224","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching","cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme","","23","3","23","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, novel observations figure out the usefulness of the User-Agent field in HTTP requests as a good source to facilitate abnormal activities detection within an abundant traffic. There are eventually several researches alarming the vulnerabilities of the User-Agent field and proposing some manual solution including a combination of tools. However, existing countermeasures are rather passive and do not allow real-time detection.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-7114-0;9781424471140","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","30","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Protection mechanisms such as anomaly-based intrusion detection and application-level IDS, tailored to Web services, are needed to detect Web attacks. The first step in developing Web application IDS is to analyze and categorize possible Web attacks and vulnerabilities.

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, we perform injection-based fault simulations and show that the error coverage of close to 100% is derived.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application.

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network. This cryptographic is highly secure which uses a distinct classified digital key which can be generated dynamically using the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm.

In general, these network attacks can be detected by deploying network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) to the cloud platform. As clients in the cloud can create many virtual machines (VMs) to run their services privately, all detection rules are usually loaded into NIDSs to avoid any oversight, and cause damage to the performance of NIDS. This work presents a new architecture for building an efficient NIDS to the cloud virtualization environment. By resolving the virtual system information from operating systems' kernel map in hypervisor layer, the services in the cloud can be identified exactly and the required detection rules can be adopted dynamically.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission. This paper focuses on trust management with their properties and provides a survey of various trust-based approaches and it proposes some novel conceptions on trust management in MANETs.","","","","10.1109/SPACES.2015.7058292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058292","MANET;Properties of Trust;Security;Trust;Trust Management","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;centralized administration;data packets transmission;geographically limited area;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;packet forwarding misbehaviour;trust management;trust-based approach;trust-based model","","1","","36","","","2-3 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Bandwidth;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Quality of service;Resource management;Security;Switches","","","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to build a framework that exposes tools and methods for a centralized processing of IEEE 802.11 frames. In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization.

Broad acceptance and relatively simple implementation also made 802.11 a perfect target for possible exploitation. Recently discovered wireless driver vulnerabilities exposed a new critical threat that legitimate users community is facing. What makes this vulnerability so dangerous to many of us is the fact that the actual exploitation cannot be prevented by commonly used tools such as firewalls, antivirus, and intrusion detection system's programs. Access to the victims machine is gained through a flawed third-party wireless driver, giving full kernel level access rights to the attacker. While kernel-level exploitation domain covers everything running beneath the operating systems, this paper describes wireless device drivers vulnerability and proposes methods for vulnerability mitigations.

Increases in both the work per network packet and packet rate make it increasingly difficult for general-purpose processor based firewalls to maintain line rate. In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall. Measurements show our hybrid firewall able to maintain close to 2 Gb/sec line rate for all packet sizes, a significant improvement over the original firewall. We also include the hard won lessons learned while implementing the hybrid firewall.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675271","hybrid firewall;netfilter;network firewall;network processor;prototype;throughput","Acceleration;Computer networks;Computer security;Information filtering;Information filters;Linux;Local area networks;Permission;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;authorisation;microprocessor chips","Linux Netfilter firewall;general-purpose processor;network firewalls;network processor acceleration","","2","3","15","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9;9781467311809","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","7","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is in spite of the fact that many networks run some type of security mechanism at their connection to the Internet. Large enterprise networks, such as the network for a major university, are very inviting targets to hackers who are looking to exploit networks. Large enterprise networks may consist of many machines running numerous operating systems. These networks normally have enormous storage capabilities and high speed/high bandwidth connections to the Internet. Due to the requirements for academic freedom, system administrators are restricted in what requirements they can place on users on these networks. The high bandwidth usages on these networks make it very difficult to identify malicious traffic within the enterprise network. We propose that a Honeynet can be used to assist the system administrator in identifying malicious traffic on the enterprise network. By its very nature, a Honeynet has no production value and should not be generating or receiving any traffic. Thus, any traffic to or from the Honeynet is suspicious in nature. Traffic from the enterprise network to a machine on the Honeynet may indicate a compromised enterprise system.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232406","","Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;authorisation;bandwidth allocation;business communication;computer crime;message authentication;network operating systems;system monitoring;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Honeynets;Honeypots;Internet;bandwidth requirement;computer crime;computer network;exploited system detection;hacking;intrusion detection;large enterprise network;malicious traffic identification","","31","17","16","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","1","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These distributed agents are the first phase of an overall plan to create a smarter network defense system through the collection and analysis of network signatures generated by real security threats. The central database to which the agents report warehouses and analyzes the meta-information collected by the interconnected agents. The agents can then utilize both instantaneous and historical data by integrating rules derived from the data collection and analysis process into intrusion prevention policies.

Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","20061002","2006","24","10","1805","1816","New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multimatch packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613","Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce","content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security","SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","12","","32","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS).

Since people and organizations now rely on distributed systems in accessing and processing critical services and mission, the availability of information and continuity of services are becoming more important. Therefore the importance of implementing systems that continue to function in the presence of security breaches cannot be overemphasized. One of the solutions to provide the availability and continuity of information system applications is introducing an intrusion tolerance system.

We obtain that buffer size is approximately half the window size in networks with high bandwidth-delay product. Though these bounds are not new, the proofs are elegant in using simple differential equations. It is worthwhile to clarify that when maximum window size is comparatively smaller than bandwidth-delay product, F-TCP gains on average the same throughput as TCP with no loss when the round-trip time of each cycle is the same.

The novelty lies in the fact that a node can correctly validate who it is, but lie about its location and exploit this to create problems to the network. There are three main factors that make ad hoc networks more vulnerable: (a) nodes can overhear other nodes announcements, (b) nodes can lie about their location, and (c) nodes can avoid detection and isolation by moving. As a result, malicious nodes can fake their position and this way obstruct the routing. In this work, we explain how location and topology related malice can affect the security of wireless ad hoc networks.

Network performance is evaluated in terms of normalized throughput, routing overhead, normalized routing load, and average packet delay, when a percentage of nodes misbehave. Simulation results show that although the performance of all three routing protocols degrades, DSDV is the most robust routing protocol under security attacks.

Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2;9781467320672","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","1","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Device-transparent network-layer handoff for micro-mobility","F. Guo; T. c.

Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539;15267539","978-1-4244-4927-9;9781424449279","978-1-4244-4928-6;9781424449286","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous research efforts have focused on boosting packet processing performance by offloading to discrete Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). While integrated GPUs, residing on the same die with the CPU, offer many advanced features such as on-chip interconnect CPU-GPU communication, and shared physical/virtual memory, their applicability for packet processing workloads has not been fully understood and exploited. In this paper, we conduct in-depth profiling and analysis to understand the integrated GPU's capabilities and performance potential for packet processing workloads. Based on that understanding, we introduce a GPU accelerated network packet processing framework that fully utilizes integrated GPU's massive parallel processing capability without the need for large numbers of packet batching, which might cause a significant processing delay. We implemented the proposed framework and evaluated the performance with several common, light-weight packet processing workloads on the Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> Processor E3-1200 v4 product family (codename Broadwell) with an integrated GT3e GPU. The results show that our GPU accelerated packet processing framework improved the throughput performance by 2-2.5x, compared to optimized packet processing on CPU only.","","","","10.1109/NETSOFT.2016.7502464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502464","","Computer architecture;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Parallel processing;Servers;Throughput","graphics processing units;parallel processing","Broadwell;Intel Xeon Processor E3-1200 v4 product family;graphics processing units;integrated GT3e GPU;massive parallel processing;network packet processing framework;network packet processing workloads;profiling","","","","17","","","6-10 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All routing protocols in WMNs naively assume nodes to be non- malicious. But, the plug-in-and-play architecture of WMNs paves way for malicious users who could exploit some loopholes of the underlying routing protocol. A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier. We illustrate using an experimental wireless network (ns-2) that the proposed scheme can accurately detect route misbehaviors with a very low false positive rate.","","0-7695-2798-1;0769527981","","10.1109/ICCGI.2007.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4137090","AODV;Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Normalization;Perceptron;and Wireless Mesh Networks.","Floods;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Statistics;Throughput;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless networks","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);routing protocols;security of data","intrusion detection;machine learning technique;malicious route floods;multihop forwarding;perceptron based classifier;routing protocols;wireless Internet connectivity;wireless mesh networks","","1","","16","","","4-9 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Cloud Computing is still a matter of great concern for a cloud user to trust security and reliability of cloud services. Cloud Computing is undergoing an incontestable success, which could be indeed compromised by concerns about the risks related to potential misuse of this model aimed at conducting illegal activities. There is major need of bringing security, transparency and reliability in cloud model for client satisfaction. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of any type of intrusion in this environment. To overcome these kinds of attacks, we propose a framework of cooperative Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (Hy-IDS) and Mobile Agents. Then, our Hybrid IDS consists of two types of IDS, which are dispatched over three layer of cloud computing. Therefore, in the first layer our framework allows to collect, analyze and detect malicious data using the first type of IDS and Mobile Agents. In case of attack, we collect at the level of the second layer all the malicious data detected in the first layer for the generation of new signatures, based on a Signature Generation Algorithm (SGA) and network intrusion detection system (NIDS). However, these new signatures are used to update the database of the IDS. The mobile agents play an important role in this collaboration. They are used in our framework for investigation of hosts, transfer data malicious and transfer update of a database of neighboring IDS in the cloud. Therefore, the neighboring IDS will use these new signatures to protect their area of control against the same type of attack. Applying this close-loop control, the collaborative network security management framework could identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","978-1-4673-8148-2;9781467381482","","10.1109/CloudTech.2015.7337013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337013","Cloud Computing;Collaborative;Hy-IDS;Mobile Agents;Signature Generation Algorithm","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Virtualization","cloud computing;digital signatures;resource allocation;software reliability;trusted computing","Hy-IDS;NIDS;SGA;close-loop control;cloud computing;cloud service reliability;cloud service security;collaborative network security management framework;hybrid intrusion detection system;mobile agent;network intrusion detection system;resource sharing;signature generation algorithm;trusted framework","","","","23","","","2-4 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, the features selected by RST will be sent to SVM model to learn and test respectively. The method is effective to decrease the space density of data. The experiments will compare the results with different methods and show RST and SVM schema could improve the false positive rate and accuracy.","","978-0-7695-3580-7;9780769535807","","10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176039","Attack Detection Rate;Intrusion Detection System;Rough Set;Support Vector Machine","Chaos;Deductive databases;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Packaging;Protection;Set theory;Space technology;Support vector machines","rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","SVM model;network intrusion detection system;rough set theory;support vector machine","","15","","14","","","1-3 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory.

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile radio;network topology;telecommunication security","automatic retaliation;hacking;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;security mechanisms;wireless ad hoc networks","","114","4","13","","","Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Numerous fault-tolerant approaches have been proposed to effectively achieve this objective in the presence of crash failures. However, such systems struggle with transient late-timing faults -- a fault classification challenging to effectively tolerate -- that manifests increasingly within large-scale distributed systems. Such faults represent a significant threat towards minimizing soft real-time execution of streaming applications in the presence of failures. This work proposes a fault-tolerant approach for QoS-aware data prediction to tolerate transient late-timing faults. The approach is capable of determining the most effective data prediction algorithm for imposed QoS constraints on a failed stream processor at run-time. We integrated our approach into Apache Storm with experiment results showing its ability to minimize stream processor end-to-end execution time by 61% compared to other fault-tolerant approaches. The approach incurs 12% additional CPU utilization while reducing network usage by 44%.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515618","Cloud computing;Data Prediction;Fault-tolerance;Stream Processing","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device. We demonstrate near perfect payload discrimination for data captured from off the shelf IoT devices.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410342","Internet of Things;network anomaly detection","Computational complexity;Detectors;Feature extraction;Hardware;Hidden Markov models;Payloads;Performance evaluation","Internet of Things;feature selection;security of data;table lookup","Internet of Things devices;IoT devices;bit-pattern matching;bitwise AND operation;conditional counter increment;feature selection;lookup-table;ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach","","","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method enhances the centralized management mechanism, where a controller reactively installs rules based on receiving the first packet of each flow, to reduce the load in the controller by decreasing the packets transmitted to the controller for packet inspection. The main feature of this method is that the gateway function redirects unknown packets to another gateway function instead of the controller, and the matched rules are installed in every gateway function on the redirection path using reverse-path forwarding. Using a simulation system, we showed that the enhanced method can reduce the number of packets arriving at the controller per unit time by ~ 62% under our use case assumption.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414122","","Inspection;Logic gates;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Servers;Virtualization","internetworking;mobile radio;network servers;telecommunication network management;virtualisation","gateway function;gateways scalable management;mobile network virtualization;packet inspection;redirection-based rules sharing;reverse-path forwarding;simulation system","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157;07303157","978-1-4244-7512-4;9781424475124","978-0-7695-4085-6;9780769540856","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The support in business and private activities will take place through the userpsilas own personal network consisting of a core Personal Area Network (PAN) extended with clusters of remote devices which could be private, shared, or public and able to adapt to the quality of the network accessed. The extended PAN with its cluster communication with another PN forms a Federation of Personal Networks (PN-F). PN-F is a secure cooperation between different PNs, making services and resources available for the purpose of achieving a common goal, increasing the security requirements and challenges. The communication in this scenario can happen in various places (home, work, public places), involving various types of network infrastructure, between various types of hardware, and exchanging any kind of service. Context aware security manager (CASM) has been proposed to solve the PN security issue, putting all the security decision in the gateway between PAN and cluster or PN and another PN. CASM relies on providing security policy based on the context being given by user. So far, algorithm regarding how to input the context has not yet been defined. Furthermore, how CASM react upon the context in deciding what security action should be performed has also not yet been elaborated. This paper will analyze the impact of context to security. The paper will work as a continuation of CASM by elaborating further a proposed algorithm on defining the context parameters, quantifying context parameter so that CASM can make decision upon it, and optimizing the matrix of context information.","2166-9570;21669570","978-1-4244-2643-0;9781424426430","978-1-4244-2644-7;9781424426447","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699962","Ad Hoc Network;Communication System Security;Personal Communication Network;Protocols","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Communication system security;Context awareness;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Personal area networks;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","internetworking;personal area networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","business activity;context aware security manager;context information matrix;decision making;gateway;personal area network security;private activity;remote device","","0","","9","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lucas","Telcordia Technologies","MILCOM 2007 - IEEE Military Communications Conference","20080222","2007","","","1","9","Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069","","Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks","","","","2","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study pipeline sharing, such that a single pipeline can be used to serve several packet types. Pipeline sharing decreases the needed total number of cores, but typically increases pipeline lengths and therefore packet delays. We consider two novel optimization problems of allocating cores between different packet types such that the average or the worst-case delay is minimized. We study the two problems and suggest optimal algorithms that apply under different assumptions on the input. We also present greedy algorithms for the general case.

By arranging several sensors to deal with the traffic in parallel, the intrusion detection system's speed can be significantly increased. How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7;9781424437467","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the techniques that has been widely used for achieving such requirements is the employment of In-Memory Key-Value Storage (IMKVS) as caching mechanisms in order to improve overall user experience. Memcached and Redis are applications that use IMKVS approach. Commonly IMKVS clients use Consistent Hashing to decide where to store an object, which may cause network load imbalance. Furthermore, these clients work only at the application layer, so network conditions are not considered to distribute user's accesses. This paper proposes a new cache architecture with two phases load balancing to improve IMKVS performance, which has adopted a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture to manage the load balancing mechanism. The proposal was evaluated in the Mininet emulation environment and shows an improvement on load balancing giving best user experience.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405549","","Computers;Control systems;IP networks;Load management;Protocols;Servers","computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;social networking (online);software defined networking;virtualisation","Mininet emulation;NFV;SDN;data center;datacenter;in-memory key-value storages;network function virtualization;social networks;two-phase load balancing","","","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Matching a variety of signatures challenges the selection of matching algorithms, as each approach has better performance than others for different signature characteristics. We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality. We also rank the factors to indicate their importance for the string matching performance.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453354","String matching;automaton;filtering;virus scanning.","","automata theory;computer viruses;cryptography;digital signatures;public domain software;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;automata tracking;backward hashing algorithm;characteristic signature;open source ClamAV;string matching;virus scanning","","1","","28","","2010-04-22","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897;10636897","0-7695-2270-X;076952270X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2;9781457714542","978-0-7695-4521-9;9780769545219","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers.

Our main goal is to support an extended view of the OpenFlow architecture by inspecting not only the packet header but also the payload information in the packets. For this purpose, we address a sophisticated packet forwarding scheme using DPI to inspect effectively all incoming packets. According to the results of our experiments, we choose the inside of a virtual switch as the most suitable position of the DPI module. In our scheme, there are a log server, a monitoring application, and DPI function for monitoring and managing network traffic. When the DPI module detects a predefined string pattern of bits in an incoming packet, the switch sends the matching information to the log server that stores logs that contain the detected pattern and resource usage. Then, the monitoring application periodically gathers log information on the log server to compare that information with predefined network policies. Finally, we show that the packets are dealt with in a more effective and efficient way in our sophisticated packet forwarding scheme.","","","","10.1109/ICSN.2016.7501921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501921","","Monitoring;Optical switches;Pattern matching;Protocols;Servers","packet switching;protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","DPI function;DPI module;OpenFlow architecture;OpenFlow protocol;OpenFlow switch;SDN controller;SDN infrastructure;deep packet inspection;log server;monitoring application;network administrators;network traffic management;network traffic monitoring;packet forwarding scheme;packet header;packet payload information;programmable network;resource usage;service chaining;software-defined networking;string pattern;virtual switch","","","","20","","","23-26 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem, called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection, the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs. However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom filters--which were originally designed for encoding binary membership information--are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter, we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2536618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431999","Computational efficiency;approximation algorithms;compression algorithms.","Arrays;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Memory management;Random access memory","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed surveillance system is used to detect fainted person at health care centers such as old folk's home, hospital, and handicapped center and is located at the place with good light condition. When a fainted person is detected, it send immediate signal and thus alerts/treatments can be carried out. In this system, a wireless webcam attached with a hyperbolic mirror is used to capture the omnidirectional scene at health care centers. The captured scenes are then fed into a laptop computer for image processing, faint detection and alarm purposing. Log-polar mapping is used to map the omnidirectional images into panoramic images.

Flooding DDoS attacks produce adverse effects for critical infrastructure availability, integrity and confidentiality. Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks.

The first vital step in dealing with this problem is the network's ability to detect such attacks. To that end, it is important that an intrusion detection mechanism be able to differentiate between real DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic, the latter of which constitutes sudden bursts of legitimate network activity. To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties. This paper proposes the design of a special testbed-based simulation method with Spirent Test Center hardware platform, to simulate both DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper focuses on the special case where video is protected by Forward Error Correction mechanisms, which allow reordering of the original packet sequence after it may have been altered by network impairments.

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","978-1-4673-8314-1;9781467383141","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature. It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node.

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SACIN delivers the common operating picture through a brokered agent-based architecture. The design follows the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) data fusion model to allow integration of different critical infrastructure systems. A generic agent component is customized for each source system to produce events and allow JDL level 0 integration. Three different analysis components collect the events and produce meaningful objects, current state and future impact estimations in accordance with JDL levels 1 to 3. Brokered architecture allows level 4 control from various components, and JDL level 5 user interface is offered through a Web application. A prototype system has been developed to test and evaluate the SACIN framework. Apache ActiveMQ message broker was used to implement the brokered architecture, and other system components were implemented using Spring framework. The system architecture was tested using real-world data from intrusion detection system (IDS)-generated syslog and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system snapshot. Customized agents for IDS and SCADA systems demonstrated that the system can process event and dependency data from different sources as part of the common operating picture and consequently can support situational awareness.","","978-1-4799-1736-5;9781479917365","","10.1109/THS.2015.7446228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446228","","Data integration;Data models;Data visualization;Scalability;Sensors;Systems architecture","SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;multi-agent systems;security of data;sensor fusion;service-oriented architecture","Apache ActiveMQ message broker;IDS;JDL;SACIN;SCADA;Spring framework;brokered agent-based architecture;brokered architecture;common operating picture;critical infrastructure systems;generic agent component;impact estimations;intrusion detection system-generated syslog;joint directors of laboratories data fusion model;situational awareness of critical infrastructure and networks framework;supervisory control and data acquisition system snapshot","","","","21","","","14-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many potential solutions (e.g., ingress filtering, packet marking or tracing, and aggregate-based congestion control or rate limiting) have been proposed to handle this network bandwidth consumption attack. Among them, ""ICMP traceback (iTrace)"" is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for ""useful"" and ""valuable"" iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called ""intention-driven"" iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process. With the new ""intention-bit"", it is shown that, through our simulation study, the performance of iTrace improves dramatically.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886;21604886","978-1-4673-1429-9;9781467314299","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","4","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions. Moreover, a sparse transition table is mapped to memory with overlapped rows, which enables to store the table in a highly compact form.","","978-1-4244-6612-2;9781424466122","","10.1109/DDECS.2010.5491816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491816","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching","FPGA;NFA-Split architecture;deterministic automaton;fast regular expression matching;flip flops;intrusion detection systems;look-up tables;malicious attacks;network attacks;nondeterministic automaton transition table;pattern matching;sparse transition table;viruses","","3","","21","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an approach to network monitoring that mitigates the resource consumption problem while still providing effective support to evidence collection and incident analysis. The approach relies on a tool, called MNEMOSYNE, that maintains a sliding window containing the traffic that has been recently seen on a network link. MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide incident analysis functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs.

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography).

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of an intrusion detection system is dependent on two metrics: throughput and the total number of patterns that can fit on a device. In this paper, we consider the FPGA implementation details of the bit-split string-matching architecture. The bit-split algorithm allows large hardware state machines to be converted into a form with much higher memory efficiency.

This paper describes a design and implementation of parallel firewall architecture that is able to handle packets for high-speed network. The implementation utilizes arrays of Linux-based firewall under data parallel scheme running incorporate with specific ASIC switch. The load balancing mechanism, using hashing of disjoint subset, distributes the traffic among a configurable number of parallel machines, providing high performance with reliability, flexibility, and scalability.

PCREF utilizes two sorts of polynomial which has been gotten from the primitive polynomial: Check Polynomial and Authentication Polynomial. PCREF uses hybrid connection instead of forwarder node used in CPNS. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) techniques are used to assign keys for each and every node in the network. It has public and private keys. Each node in the network has its own ID and it plays a vital role in sharing information with the sink node.

Feamster","Georgia Institute of Technology","IEEE Communications Magazine","20130214","2013","51","2","114","119","Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.","0163-6804;01636804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461195","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Control systems;Home automation;Logic gates;Software radio;Telecommunication network management","computer network management;high level languages;telecommunication security","SDN;complex high-level network policy;high-level policy language;logically centralized software program;low-level vendor-specific configuration;network management;packet forwarding device;secure communication;software defined networking;stop-gap solution","","116","1","13","","","February 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","1","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks. The functionality of the system was also extended by installing nodes in different geographical locations, and streaming their detections into the central Amber hive.","2330-9881;23309881","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641053","Honeypot;Security Models","Context;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;decision making","DtD;DtP;South African market;central Amber hive;decision making;decision through detection;decision through presence;geographical locations;human capital;modular intelligence;network enforcer;security control;zero-interaction honeypot;zero-interaction security system","","0","","22","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes MF (minority first) as a traffic metering and control scheme that can provide quick weakness of DDoS attack, while protecting legitimate user's traffic. The key idea of MF scheme is to provide good quality of service (QoS) to sources that use the network resource properly and poor QoS to sources that use network resource so excessively as to result in network congestion.

In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must ""port over"" a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163","domain adaptation;flow-based classification","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training","cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols","confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature","","6","","29","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

WSN consists of numerous tiny wireless sensor nodes to communicate with each other with limited resources due to cost and size restrictions. Advancements in WSNs enable a wide range of environmental monitoring and object tracking applications. The major factor to be tackle in WSN the network lifetime and that actually depends on the efficiency of the routing protocol. A novel Biological Inspired Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol (BIOSARP) enhances Secure Real Time Load Distribution (SRTLD) with self-optimized routing mechanism that reduces neighbor discovery process at every hop. BIOSARP routing protocol depends on the optimal forwarding decision obtained by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. On top of ACO algorithm to provide preventive measures against abnormalities BIOSARP utilized artificial immune system (AIS). In this paper we present the energy efficiency and performance of ACO and AIS based hybrid nature adaptive computing method. Primarily, ACO based BIOSARP has been compared with SRTLD and onwards output of ACO algorithm and ACO+AIS algorithm is compared and analyzed in terms of delivery ratio, energy consumption and packet overhead. Network simulator 2 (NS2) has been utilized to perform the analysis. Our result shows that the hybrid nature adaptive optimization algorithm effectively shows better performance and increase network lifetime due to less energy consumption.","","978-0-7695-4967-5;9780769549675","","10.1109/ITNG.2013.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614359","","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological system modeling;Optimization;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","ant colony optimisation;energy conservation;energy consumption;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","ACO+AIS algorithm;BIOSARP routing protocol;WSN;ant colony optimization;artificial immune system;biological inspired secure autonomous routing protocol;energy consumption;energy efficient information assured routing;hybrid nature adaptive computing method;hybrid nature adaptive optimization algorithm;hybrid optimization algorithm;network simulator 2;secure real time load distribution;self-optimized routing mechanism;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor nodes","","1","","19","","","15-17 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","1","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This possibility is offered by a security information and event management (SIEM) system. But nowadays these systems are very complex and expensive in deployment and maintenance ([12]).

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our system, an independent intrusion detection system reports identified malicious tasks periodically. The recovery system detects all damage caused by the malicious tasks and automatically repairs the damage according to dependency relations. Without multiple versions of data objects, recovery tasks may be corrupted by executing normal tasks when we try to run damage analysis and normal tasks concurrently.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

There is no centralized network. There are various attacks for which defend mechanism have been proposed by many researchers. Out of all such attacks wormhole attack poses a great threat as it has ability to grab the route more easily and is difficult to prevent. This paper basically focuses on wormhole attack and proposes an efficient detection and prevention method for this type of attack in AODV protocol using trust based mechanism. The method uses multi-paths for the path discovery process and thus provides greater path selection. The proposed method works by observing the routing path and the path that exceeds the threshold value are considered as wormhole link and the nodes on that link are identified as wormhole nodes. After detection of wormhole attack, for sending data packet from source to destination node we prefer multiple paths by which efficiency of network increases and packet delay as well as packet drop minimizes to great extent. Thus improves the Quality of Service of AODV protocol against wormhole attack.","","978-1-4673-6790-5;9781467367905","","10.1109/ICSCTI.2015.7489559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489559","AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector);MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Networks);Multi-path routing;Trust Based System;Wormhole Attack","Cryptography;Law;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;TV","mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV protocol;MANET infrastructure;base station;data packet sending;detection and prevention method;multipath routing method;packet delay;packet drop;path discovery process;path selection;quality of service improvement;routing path;source to destination node;trust based system;wormhole attack;wormhole link","","","","27","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","13","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack.

In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem.

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path. I show through performance analysis that the basic local monitoring fails to mitigate the misrouting attack while MlMl successfully does.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4697929","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Relays;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","local monitoring;misrouting attack;multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks;neighborhood communication;packet misrouting;security attacks","","0","","17","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The anonymous protocols hide the identity of the malicious node and enhance the possibility of Black Hole Attack. In order to provide anonymity without compromising the security, we have extended Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing Protocol(ALERT) to make it secure. The secure version is named as Secure Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing protocol (S-ALERT). S-ALERT uses Suspect Detection algorithm to choose the nodes in a route which provide unperceivable route. If there is existence of a Black Hole it actually sends a false RREP packet and advertises itself as the shortest route found. The proposed scheme avoid the black hole problem, and also prevent the network from further malicious behavior. Through simulation results it has been shown that proposed method can effectively detect and provide protection from black hole attack.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-147X;1946147X","978-1-4244-7842-2;9781424478422","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","6","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A fast and effective IDS for mobile networks that does not violate the user's privacy or the network's QoS is required. This paper offers a set of flow-based features that can be utilized for mobile network traffic as a prerequisite for a privacy-aware and QoS-robust IDS. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used for reduction of the features. Twelve features in six groups, which represent the user data in mobile traffic, were extracted and evaluated for IDSs. The evaluation process achieved a F-measure weighted average equal to 0.834, and the experimental time was equal to 12.9 seconds. The accomplished measurements have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed set of features.","","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500483","Internet of Things (IoT) security;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs);feature extraction;mobile traffic","Feature extraction;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunications","mobile communication;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PCA;QoS;flow-based features;intrusion detection system;mobile network traffic;mobile networks;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile traffic;network security;principal component analysis;security risks;threat detection systems;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA.

First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097;15219097","978-1-4577-1875-5;9781457718755","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Patterns based detectors used in Packet Inspection implement multi-pattern matching algorithms to check whether the packet payload have a specified patterns in a patterns set. Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9;9781467319119","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of the network.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2526601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401098","Wireless sensor network;channel-aware;packet dropping;reputation system;routing;selective forwarding attack;wireless sensor network","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Packet loss;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CRS-A;WSN;adaptive aware detection;adaptive detection threshold;attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme;channel aware detection;forwarding packets;information integrity;monitored packet loss;selective forwarding attacks;sensor nodes;time-varied channel condition;wireless channel;wireless sensor networks","","","","35","","2016-02-08","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic.

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level.

Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device.

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6;9781424474226","978-1-4244-7421-9;9781424474219","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these algorithms are computationally sophisticated, some hardware accelerators are needed to support high throughput. In this paper we propose an IPsec-based secure call admission control (SCAC) with multiple cryptographic accelerators. Our proposed IPsec-based Multifence Secure Call Admission Control in heterogeneous networks enhanced with Malicious Packets Filter (MPF), is a set of technologies and solutions. It enforces security policy and bandwidth compliance on all devices seeking to access network computing resources, in order to limit damage from emerging security threats and to allow network access only to compliant and trusted endpoint devices. This SCAC also provides support for quality of service. High-level simulations and the related results are provided to show the effectiveness of the SCAC.","2161-2889;21612889","978-0-7695-2878-6;9780769528786","","10.1109/NGMAST.2007.4343426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4343426","","Access protocols;Call admission control;Computer networks;Computer security;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Performance analysis","IP networks;cryptographic protocols;quality of service;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security","IPSec suite;bandwidth compliance;computer network communication;cryptographic accelerators;cryptographic protocols;malicious packet filter;multifence secure call admission control;public networks;quality of service","","0","","25","","","12-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, extending vehicular networks to include IP connections is still problematic, due in part to the incompatibility of mobile IP handovers with the increased mobility of vehicles. The handover process, consisting of discovery, registration, and packet forwarding, has a large overhead and disrupts connectivity. With increased handover frequency and smaller access point dwell times in vehicular networks, the handover causes a large degradation in performance. This paper proposes a predictive handover protocol, using a combination of a Kalman filter and an online hidden Markov model, to minimize the effects of prediction errors and to capitalize on advanced handover registration. Extensive simulated experiments were carried out in NS-2 to study the performance of the proposed protocol within a variety of traffic and network topology scenarios. Results show a significant improvement to both prediction accuracy and network performance when compared to recent proposed approaches.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2503703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337466","Kalman filter;handover;hidden Markov model;mobility management;prediction;vehicular mobility;vehicular networks;wireless network","Accuracy;Handover;History;IP networks;Mobile communication;Vehicles","","","","","","","","2015-11-25","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","2","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591;15301591","978-1-4244-7054-9;9781424470549","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","34","43","Web servers are ubiquitous, remotely accessible, and often misconfigured. In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways.

Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant ""convergecast"" traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates ""spatially-correlated contention."" This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.","2155-5486;21555486","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842","","Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks","MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks","","7","","28","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","5","","7","","2013-06-06","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the major security attacks in WSN. Jamming a single or cluster of nodes is a type of DoS attack on WSN. In this paper, a novel approach in detecting the physical layer DoS style jamming attack is proposed and analyzed. Here, we propose a method called physical layer jamming identification.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack.

However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels. The reported experimental results point out that our solution can significantly increase intradomain scalability with very limited costs.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6342884","Mobile computing;mobile applications;network management;support services","Load management;Mobile computing;Scalability","IP networks;information dissemination;mobility management (mobile radio);multimedia communication;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing","IMS-based services;IP multimedia subsystem;application providers;component deactivation;data-centric session state dissemination;data-intensive services;design guidelines;fast intradomain balancing;instant messaging;interoperable session control;intradomain deployment issues;intradomain scalability;long-term intradomain load partitioning;mobility management;network operators;next-generation all-IP networks;scalable IMS-based deployment;service-aware load monitoring;service-aware routing","","2","","34","","2012-11-10","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3168-7;9780769531687","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","37","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hierarchical methods are more efficient for this. Apart from achieving energy efficiency, the load on balancing and security are essential. Security Aware Energy Balanced Hierarchical Protocol (SEBHP) builds a clustered hierarchical routing tree and minimizes the energy utilization by selecting efficient relay nodes and routing path and implements security by means of introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","6","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on the principle that networks should allow users to focus on data, rather than having a reference to a physical location where that data is, the adoption of new paradigms can be justified. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm that gives a potential improvement to content distribution, such as local content caching, which helps to reduce delay and increase delivery speed. From another point of view, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) defines a new Internet architecture where network devices are simple and the control plane is managed by a centralized controller, providing an inexpensive and reliable architecture. This paper presents ContentSDN, an architecture that integrates ICN and SDN, providing transparent in-network caching for content delivery. ContentSDN uses the concept of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), allowing network orchestration and high scalability at runtime. Content caching is driven by manageable policies that can be adjusted according to business needs. The proposed architecture has been evaluated on an emulated environment where multiple users request content through the HTTP protocol. Results show that ContentSDN improves the Quality of Experience and make a more efficient use of network resources.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-5090-1857-4;9781509018574","","10.1109/AINA.2016.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474135","Information-Centric Networking (ICN);Network Functions Virtualization (NFV);Software-Defined Networking (SDN)","Computer architecture;Control systems;IP networks;Internet;Proposals;Protocols","Internet;computer architecture;content management;quality of experience;software defined networking;transport protocols;virtualisation","ContentSDN;HTTP protocol;ICN;Internet paradigm;NFV;business needs;content distribution;content-based paradigm;content-based transparent proxy architecture;information-centric networking;location-based paradigm;network functions virtualization;quality of experience;software-defined networking","","","","25","","","23-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","17","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Users who are connected to the internet are able to access various internet services provided by critical information infrastructure. However, some organisations have not effectively secured their critical information infrastructure and hackers, disgruntled employees and other entities have taken advantage of this by launching cyberattacks on their critical information infrastructure. They do this by using cyberthreats to exploit vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure which organisations fail to secure. As a result, cyberthreats are able to steal or damage confidential information stored on systems or take down websites, preventing access to information. Despite this, risk strategies can be used to implement a number of security controls: preventive, detective and corrective controls, which together form a system of controls. This will ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is preserved, thus reducing risks to information. This system of controls is based on the General Systems Theory, which states that the elements of a system are interdependent and contribute to the operation of the whole system. Finally, a model is proposed to address insecure critical information infrastructure.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2014.7028160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028160","Critical Information Infrastructure;Cyberattacks;Cyberthreats;Security Controls;Vulnerabilities","Availability;Computer crime;Malware;Personnel;Planning","Internet;business data processing;computer crime;data integrity;data privacy;risk management","Internet service access;confidential information stealing;corrective control;critical information infrastructure protection;cyberattacks;cyberthreats;detective control;disgruntled employees;general systems theory;hackers;information access;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;organisational information;preventive control;risk reduction;security controls;vulnerability exploitation","","1","","20","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new firewall model based on the proposed connection tracking mechanism is then developed and extended from the basic model of Net filter's Conn Track module, which has been used by many early generation commercial and open source firewalls including IPTABLES, the most popular firewall. To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed. The experimental results show that our model performs more efficiently in comparison with the Net filter/IPTABLES.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011242","Connection Tracking;Firewall;Network Security;Stateful firewall;Tree-rule firewall","Computational modeling;Filtering;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Memory management;Ports (Computers)","Linux;firewalls","IPTABLES;Linux Cent OS 6.3;Netfilter ConnTrack module;Netfilter model;connection tracking mechanism;designated tree structure;firewall rules;generation commercial;hashing bits;memory space;open source firewalls;stateful mechanism;tree-rule firewall model","","0","","24","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our research is not focused on new algorithms or products capable of solving the security problem in cloud networks: our goal is to define a process and a novel architecture that minimizes the security risk in distributed networks, implementing the principle that network security and reliability is not a “product,” but a well defined “process.” On the basis of the defined architecture we have implemented a prototype cloud-based IDS that validates our thesis.

The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a ""black"" convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations. This paper highlights the implementation and intended operations of the new, net-centric teleport.","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1606159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1606159","","Bandwidth;Buildings;Circuits;Command and control systems;Information systems;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Military computing;Radio frequency;Satellite communication","IP networks;Internet telephony;bandwidth allocation;command and control systems;internetworking;military communication;modems;open systems;resource allocation;routing protocols;satellite communication;surveillance;telecommunication security;transport protocols","DISA;DISN;Defense Information Systems Agency;Department of Defense;GIG;GWOT;Global War on Terror;IP-based networking modem;ISR mission;NetOp;OEF;OIF;Operations Enduring Freedom;Operations Iraqi Freedom;TPO;VoIP gateway;bandwidth resource allocation;circuit-based communication technology;command-control system;commercial satellite communication;convergence router;defense information systems network;global information grid;global network operation;intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance;interoperability;intratheater communication;military satellite communication;multiple radio frequency;net-centric DoD teleport;teleport program office;transport security;voice over Internet protocol;warfighter transformation","","0","","","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4;9780769539294","978-1-4244-5421-1;9781424454211","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first identify worm characteristics through their behavior, and then classify worm detection algorithms based on the parameters used in the algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","1060-9857;10609857","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a malicious nodes detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, Merkle tree hashing technique. In our defense techniques we have two stages. The first stage is to detect the attack, and the second stage is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature. Simulation results show this robust mechanism achieves a very high accuracy and detection rate.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396496","Denial-of-Service;Malicious Node Detection;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attacks;Security","Australia;Electronic mail;Information technology;Network coding;Routing;Security;Wireless communication","computer network security;cryptography","Merkle tree hashing technique;acknowledgement based mechanisms;destination nodes;malicious node traceback;malicious nodes detection mechanism;networks coding based mechanism;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attack;source nodes","","","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4673-0228-9;9781467302289","978-1-4673-0227-2;9781467302272","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (stochastic clustering algorithm for network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the incoming audit data and compute the missing values in the audit data.

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.","","978-1-4673-6425-6;9781467364256","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124","","Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks","Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network","","1","","11","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry.

This paper presents an implementation of a 10 Gb Ethernet switch hardware platform using a IXP2850 which is the Intel's network processor and a Redhawk which is the Ample Communications' 10 Gb Ethernet MAC. We described the hardware architecture of the implemented 10 Gb Ethernet switch hardware platform which has two 10 Gb XFP (10 gigabit small form-factor pluggable) ports and the software implementation to boot and manage the system. Also, we implemented packet forwarding application which runs on the IXP2850. The architecture of the forwarding application is included in this paper.","1738-9445;17389445","978-89-5519-131-8;9788955191318","","10.1109/ICACT.2007.358418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4195197","","Application software;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Ethernet networks;Explosions;Hardware;IP networks;Local area networks;Quality of service;Switches","local area networks;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication switching","EMAC;Ethernet switch hardware platform;Gigabit Ethernet switch;IXP2850;local area network;network processor;packet forwarding;public data networks;quality of service;routers","","0","","12","","","12-14 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions. The FASTER (Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration) project aims at introducing a complete methodology to allow designers to easily implement a system specification on a platform which includes a general purpose processor combined with multiple accelerators running on an FPGA, taking as input a high-level description and fully exploiting, both at design time and at run time, the capabilities of partial dynamic reconfiguration. The goal is that for selected application domains, the FASTER toolchain will be able to reduce the design and verification time of complex reconfigurable systems providing additional novel verification features that are not available in existing tool flows.","","978-1-4673-2570-7;9781467325707","978-1-4673-2571-4;9781467325714","10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322881","","Computer architecture;Context;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Runtime;Schedules;Software","customer satisfaction;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","FASTER project;FASTER toolchain;FPGA;Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration project;complex reconfigurable systems;customer satisfaction;customer tracking;design time reduction;general purpose processor;hardware accelerators;hardware adaptation;high-level description;market trends;partial dynamic reconfiguration;performance efficiency;power efficiency;product lifetime;smart technologies;software adaptivity;system specification;technology trends;user applications;verification time reduction","","1","","14","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It realizes pipeline operations by adjusting delay times. Implementation of fine-tuning of wave-pipelines is possible to further increase the throughput. However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times. It is the area of less than half of the logic block.","","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207067","RTL design;connection block;delay times;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);fine-tuning;low-power design;wave-pipeline","Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Routing;Switches;Throughput;Transistors;Tuning","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;logic design;pipeline processing","RTL design;delay time adjustment;field programmable gate arrays;high speed FPGA;low-power FPGA;pipeline operations;register transfer level design;wave pipeline fine tuning","","0","","13","","","24-27 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges.

Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching.

In order to prevent such leakage, we propose the Data Leakage Prevention System (DLPS) which is applied at the entrance of the enterprise network to filter out the outgoing sensitive information. The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB). We also find that the memory consumption of Skip-FA is almost the same to that of the original files.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683165","","Automata;Delay;Engines;IEEE Communications Society;Logic gates;Payloads;Radiation detectors","finite automata;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","content scanning engine;data leakage prevention system;deep packet inspection;file sharing network;finite automata representation;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching problem;secure enterprise network;skip finite automata;skip finite automaton","","1","1","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme. A supercapacitor is utilized for buffering, energy storing, and filtering purposes, which enables more functions of the IOT smart nodes such as active sensing and system-on-chip (SOC) signal processing. The output voltage ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 V for different device loads, such as sensors, SOC, or wireless transceivers.

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully. By PDA algorithm the neighbor nodes inform about the attacker by raising a global alarm and prevent an intruder from the malicious attacks in the network.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950037","PDA;detection;misbehaving node;packet dropping;prevention","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDA algorithm;PDA-misbehaving node detection;PDA-misbehaving node prevention;changing topology;cooperative node;intruder prevention;intrusion detection-prevention algorithm;low-cost mobile devices;malicious activity;malicious attack detection;malicious attack prevention;malicious attackers;malicious node;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;neighbor nodes;node cooperation;node distribution;noncooperative nodes;packet dropping detection algorithm;packet forwarding;route detection;wireless networking capabilities","","0","","10","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","15","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","33","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A tradeoff model for a system's dynamic performance and its security is presented. This model can be used to allocate system resources to provide sufficient protection and to satisfy the D-NCS's real-time dynamic performance requirements simultaneously. Then, the paper proposes a paradigm of the performance-security tradeoff optimization based on the coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) for D-NCS.

We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner.

IEEE","20100304","2009","","","1","7","Load balancing is critical to the performance of parallel processing systems. It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a partitioning approach to network security, analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size.

This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits of adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. Digital forensic readiness is a relatively new exciting field which can prepare and prevent incidents from occurring within an eSC environment if implemented strategically. With the current state of cybercrime, tool developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness tools that can keep up with the current technological advancements, such as (eSCs), in the business world. Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is that there are no DFR tools that are designed to support eSCs specifically. There are some general-purpose monitoring tools that have forensic readiness functionality, but currently there are no tools specifically designed to serve the eSC environment. Therefore, this paper discusses the limitations of current digital forensic readiness tools for the eSC environment and an architectural design for next-generation eSC DFR systems is proposed, along with the system requirements that such systems must satisfy. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness tools, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current tools.","","978-1-4799-7754-3;9781479977543","","10.1109/ISSA.2015.7335075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335075","Cyber-Crime;Digital forensic Investigation (DFI);Digital forensic data analysis tools;Digital forensic readiness (DFR);Forensics domains;Monitoring tools;Network forensics;e-Supply Chains (eSCs)","Business;Digital forensics;Filtering;Monitoring;Next generation networking;Software","digital forensics;electronic commerce;supply chain management","ICT;Internet;cybercrime;digital forensic readiness tools;e-supply chain;eSC environment;electronic supply chain;information and communications technology;trading partners","","","","12","","","12-13 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117","Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis","BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities","","0","","27","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.","","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454499","Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network;eHealthcare","Computer crime;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network security;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet of things;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;data packet delivery ratio;denial of service attacks;wireless mesh network;wireless mesh routing protocol","","","","21","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol.

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them.

The goal is to replace a lost essential service by another service that supports mission fulfillment in a different but equivalent way. Application-level survivability, the ability to reconfigure an application to transparently maintain services when part of a system becomes unavailable, is the most flexible and comprehensive approach to supporting mission fulfillment since it can provide assurance over all lower layers within a networked system. We have developed resumable FTP, an application based on RFC 959, which has the ability to resume the download of a file after the download has been interrupted by users or by lower layers (loss of connection). FTP continues to be the most common method for bulk data transfer across networks and as high-performance network infrastructures have become established, default implementations of FTP have not kept pace. More importantly, FTP is similar to a class of future applications that use separate channels for data and control enabling long-lasting sessions. We present the design and use of rFTP and conclude with future architectures for providing application-layer survivability in other domains.","","0-7803-7225-5;0780372255","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985772","","Application software;Computer bugs;Computer science;Computer security;Internet;Protocols;Resumes;Switches;Telephony;Web pages","Internet;computer network reliability;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet attacks;Java;RFC 959;application-level survivability;bulk data transfer;control channels;data channels;file downloading;high-performance network infrastructure;lower-layer security detection;lower-layer security prevention;networked system;protocol stack;rFTP;resumable FTP;software application failure;system downtime","","1","1","17","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network.

Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function.

On the other side firewalls have optimized several times and different types have been introduced. Today by integrating NIDS and firewall a new product comes to the market, which is called IPS. IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands. The data is transferred in standard XML format. We also test the model by standard DARPA99 data sets and the results are satisfied.","","978-0-7695-3615-6;9780769536156","","10.1109/JCAI.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159015","Firewall;IPS;NIDS;Security;Snort","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Filtering;Hardware;Information systems;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection","Internet;Linux;XML;authorisation;digital signatures;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IPS;IPTABLES command;IPV4;Linux;XML format;intrusion prevention system;multiple server processor technology;network intrusion detection system;network primary point;network security;signature-based NIDS with packet filtering firewall;snort-open source NIDS","","1","","17","","","25-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack).

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores.

The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a performance metric to significantly improve the development and the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment.

"LEoNIDS: A Low-Latency and Energy-Efficient Network-Level Intrusion Detection System","N. Tsikoudis; A. Papadogiannakis; E. P. Markatos","Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","20160302","2016","4","1","142","155","Over the past decade, design and implementation of low-power systems has received significant attention. While it started with data centers and battery-operated mobile devices, it has recently branched to core network devices such as routers. However, this emerging need for low-power system design has not been studied for security systems, which are becoming increasingly important today. Toward this direction, we aim to reduce the power consumption of network-level intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are used to improve the secure operation of modern computer networks. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to low-power system design, such as frequency scaling, lead to a disproportionate increase in packet processing and queuing times. In this paper, we show that this increase has a negative impact on the detection latency and impedes a timely reaction. To address this issue, we present a low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS (LEoNIDS): an architecture that resolves the energy-latency tradeoff by providing both low power consumption and low detection latency at the same time. The key idea is to identify the packets that are more likely to carry an attack and give them higher priority so as to achieve low attack detection latency. Our results indicate that LEoNIDS consumes power comparable to a state-of-the-art low-power design, while, at the same time, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster attack detection.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2369958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977945","Energy-Efficient Systems;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion detection systems;Low Latency;Low-Power design;Multi-Core Packet Processing;Network Security;Performance;energy-efficient systems;low latency;low-power design;multi-core packet processing;network security;performance","Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Program processors;Security;Time-frequency analysis","computer network security;energy conservation;low-power electronics;power aware computing;power consumption","LEoNIDS;battery-operated mobile devices;core network devices;data centers;frequency scaling;low attack detection latency;low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS;low-latency and energy-efficient network-level intrusion detection system;low-power system design;modern computer networks;packet processing;power consumption;queuing times;routers;secure operation;security systems","","0","","30","","2014-12-05","Jan.-March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security in Von Neumann architecture is currently poorly considered, and it does not reduce significant vulnerabilities. Separating the network communication components from the data processing ones is our concern in this paper. Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data. In this paper we implemented a model for a dual bus architecture system based on a bus bridge which controls the data transferred between the two system buses, as well as preventing all spy ware programs. The experiment is done and the result has proven that the dual bus architecture is reasonable and effective. The analysis also showed that the entire computer system, including peripherals is well protected from outside intruders.","","978-1-4673-2670-4;9781467326704","","10.1109/SERE-C.2012.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258458","Computer Architecture;Dual-Bus System;HDL Modeling and Simulation;Intrusion Prevention System","Computer architecture;Computers;Program processors;Security;Switches","security of data;system buses","Von Neumann architecture;bus bridge;data processing;data protection;network communication;secure PC platform;single CPU dual bus architecture;spy ware programs","","0","","16","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The big data processing is done through HAMR, which is a next generation in-memory MapReduce engine. HAMR has reported high speedups over existing big data solutions across several analytics algorithms. The analytics engine comprises a novel ensemble algorithm, which extracts training data from clusters of the multiple IDS alarms.

To enhance performance, rules are typically compiled into a matching automaton that can quickly identify the subset of rules that are applicable to a given network packet. While deterministic automata provide the best performance, previous research has shown that such automata can be exponential in the size and/or number of rules. Nondeterministic automata can avoid size explosion, but their matching time can increase quickly with the number of rules. In contrast, we present a new technique that constructs polynomial size automata. Moreover, we show that the matching time of our automata is insensitive to the number of rules. The key idea in our approach is that of decomposing and reordering the tests on packet header fields so that the result of performing a test can be utilized on behalf of many rules. Our experiments demonstrate major reductions in space requirements over previous techniques, as well as significant improvements in matching speed. Our technique can uniformly handle prioritized and unprioritized rules, and support applications that require single-match as well as multi-match.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2489182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295611","Firewalls;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Monitoring;Packet Classification;Packet classification;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network monitoring","Automata;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Polynomials;Runtime","authorisation;deterministic automata;firewalls","access-control system;compact packet matching automata;condition factorization;deterministic automata;intrusion detection;nondeterministic automata;rule-based matching","","","","45","","2015-10-09","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""denial of service"" (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""cross layer based intrusion detection system""(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set.

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis. Once enough data is gathered, it is necessary to rapidly analyze it and determine whether any attacks or malicious activities are present, which is the main issue that impacts IDS performance.","","978-1-4799-1594-1;9781479915941","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724158","Cloud Computing;Hadoop File System;Intrusion Detection System;MapReduce","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computers;File systems;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;security of data","Hadoop;IDS;IDS monitors network traffic;cloud computing infrastructure;computer systems;data analytics;data processing;distributed computing system;distributed file system;malicious activities;malicious attacks;network administrator;network environment security;network security;open-source computing platform;scalable intrusion detection systems log analysis;storage services;suspicious activity","","1","","11","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response to this, a number of countermeasures have been developed, including intrusion detection systems that aim to detect anomalous behaviour caused by attacks. We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network. The attack space on a mesh network is particularly large; we motivate the need for and describe the challenges of adopting an asset-driven approach to managing this space.

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These technologies have support of one of famous technique known as Adhoc Network. Adhoc Networks are assortment of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and also receiving attention in the scientific community. In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account. Proposed method optimizes the routing issues by using AODV. The result of this paper is an appropriate solution against neighbor attacks.","","978-1-4244-9683-9;9781424496839","","10.1109/EAIT.2011.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734955","AODV;MANETs;adhoc routing;flow capacity;ns2;relative position;signal strength","Ad hoc networks;Equations;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","Internet;mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology","GNDA;Internet technology;MANET;adhoc routing protocol;communication technology;flow capacity;good neighbor node detection;mobile node assortment;network topology;signal strength;wireless link;wireless technology","","0","","14","","","19-20 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient Network Security Policy Enforcement With Policy Space Analysis","X. Wang; W. Shi; Y. Xiang; J. Li","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Network operators rely on security services to protect their IT infrastructures. Different kinds of network security policies are defined globally and distributed among multiple security middleboxes deployed in networks. However, due to the complexity of security policy, it is inefficient to directly employ existing path-wise enforcement approaches. This paper models the enforcement of network security policy as the set-covering problem, and designs a computational-geometry-based policy space analysis (PSA) tool for set operations of security policy. Leveraging the PSA, this paper first investigates the topological characteristics of different types of policies. This heuristic information reveals intrinsic complexities of security policy and guides the design of our enforcement approach. Then the paper proposes a scope-wise policy enforcement algorithm that selects a modest number of enforcement network nodes to deploy multiple policy subsets in a greedy manner. This approach can be employed on network topologies of both datacenter and service provider. The efficiencies of the PSA tool and the enforcement algorithm are also evaluated. Compared with the header space analysis, the PSA achieves much better memory and time efficiencies on set operations of security policy. Additionally, the proposed enforcement algorithm is able to guarantee network security within a reasonable number of enforcement network nodes, without introducing many extra rules.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2502402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362256","Middlebox policy enforcement;policy space analysis;software-defined network","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Middleboxes;Routing;Security","","","","","","","","2015-12-22","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSN are harmed or damaged by the Denial of Service (DoS) attack which destroy the network, resources and lose its energy rapidly. Various IDS used to detect malicious node in the network but they consume more energy to monitor malicious node, so decrease the network lifetime and throughput. It is important to form an energy efficient IDS which detect intruder accurately and consume less energy. In this paper, EEIDS (Energy Efficient Intrusion Detection Scheme) is proposed and designed, which detect malicious node based on energy consumption of nodes by comparing actual and predicted energy. The node with abnormal energy detected as malicious node. In EEIDS, Bayesian approach is used for energy prediction of sensor nodes, in which energy consumption of each sensor node is predicted using prior information and likelihood function also energy efficient approach used to reduce energy consumption of network. The simulation results show that EEIDS gives better network lifetime, throughput and energy consumption and effectively detect malicious node.","","978-1-4673-6993-0;9781467369930","","10.1109/ICACC.2015.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433787","Bayesian approach;EEIDS;IDSEP;WSN;energy consumption;energy prediction","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;energy consumption;security of data;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS;WSN;bayesian energy prediction;denial of service attack;energy consumption;energy efficient intrusion detection scheme;malicious node;network lifetime;wireless sensor network","","","","14","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It promises to virtualize entire classes of network node functions within a data-center and to deliver network services in the form of Virtualized Network Function (VNF) service chains using commercial off-the-shelf hardware and IT virtualization technologies. However, availability gets an important issue when purpose-built telecom hardware designed for the ""fives nines"" standard via built-in failure protection and recovery mechanisms is replaced by the off-the shelf hardware. With commercial off-the-shelf data-center hardware, failure probabilities could be higher than in traditional physical network infrastructure. Thus with NFV, infrastructure availability has to be considered all the way from the physical right up to the hypervisor layer and resilience mechanisms need to be built into the software and service provisioning design. In this work, we model different backup strategies for VNF service chains and provide algorithms for their resilient embedding in the data-center. Further, we answer the question which data-center topologies offer the best cost-per-throughput relation for a given resilience/availability for VNF service chains.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414158","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Europe;Hardware;Servers;Software;Topology","computer architecture;computer centres;computer network reliability;system recovery;virtualisation","IT virtualization technology;NFV;VNF service chain;commercial off-the-shelf hardware technology;data-center architecture;failure probabilities;high availability requirements;hypervisor layer mechanism;hypervisor resilience mechanism;infrastructure availability;network function virtualization;virtualized network function service chain","","","","19","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a framework that predicts multi-stage attacks based on a different approach, which is an IP information evaluation. This approach was chosen after analysing three different multi-stage attack scenarios. This paper shows the analysis of those scenarios, detailing their steps and information hitherto unexploited in current intrusion detection systems.

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.","","978-1-4244-4816-6;9781424448166","978-1-4244-4817-3;9781424448173","10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207","bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme","Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads","computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching","Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats","","2","3","10","","","16-18 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns.

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV.

To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA.

It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX).

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion. We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes. This represents an increase in throughput of nearly 4x over the baseline Click running comparable elements on the CPU.","","978-1-4799-1640-5;9781479916405","","10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665173","","Graphics processing units;IP networks;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Throughput","","","","8","","28","","","21-22 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention. In this way, ESIDE-Depian uses a Bayesian network to learn from both anomaly and misuse knowledge in order to be able to detect either kind of attacks, known and unknown.

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection.

In this work, we focus on the best relay selection and the optimization of the Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) at the relays, aiming at the throughput maximization of the network. Existing literature optimizes PNC with respect to the maximization of the minimum rate among users. The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing non-symmetric rates, while the optimal solution is explored with the aid of the Pareto frontier. The problem of relay selection is matched to a coalition formation game, where the relays and the CD cooperate to maximize their profit. Efficient coalition formation algorithms are proposed, which perform joint relay selection and PNC optimization. Simulation results show that a considerable improvement is achieved compared to existing results, both in terms of the network sum rate and the players' profits.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2405547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045583","Cloud Base Stations;Cloud Radio Access Networks;Cloud radio access networks;Compute-and-Forward;Cooperative Game Theory;Physical Layer Network Coding;Relay Selection;cloud base stations;compute-and-forward;cooperative game theory;physical layer network coding;relay selection","Equations;Games;Network coding;Optimization;Relays;Vectors;Wireless communication","Pareto optimisation;cloud computing;decoding;game theory;network coding;receiving antennas;relay networks (telecommunication)","CD;L antennas/relays;Pareto frontier;centralized decoder;cloud compute-and-forward;cloud network;coalition formation game;compute-and-forward protocol;decode integer equations;distributed receiving antennas;maximization;physical layer network coding;relay cooperation;relay selection;transmitted messages","","2","","32","","2015-02-19","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Especially with resource constraints in dynamic networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), security needs to be of particular consideration. In this paper, we first analyze the solution concept involved in optimizing resource allocation and data packet forwarding. In a MANET, the availability of having data packets forwarded may be insubstantial due to the presence of selfish nodes. Nodes may not want to participate in the network to preserve their own resources. We propose a packet-forwarding problem model with a negotiation game, where an arbitrator acts as a cluster head and initiates a bargaining game. Thereafter, we consider the possibility of having some group of nodes exhibit malicious behavior and collude to subvert the MANET. We investigate the problem by finding the optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies of the negotiation game. Then, we simulate the effect of the coalition of malicious nodes in a mobile environment. Simulation results support our model.","","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490630","MANET;arbitrator;collusion;malicious nodes;negotiation game;network security","Ad hoc networks;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Reliability;Resource management;Security","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;arbitrator cluster head;bargaining game initiation;colluding nodes;data packet forwarding;game theory;mobile ad hoc network;negotiation game;optimal Nash equilibrium strategy;packet forwarding problem model;resource allocation","","","","17","","","18-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1499-7;1424414997","1-4244-1500-4;1424415004","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we provide a simulation of MPEG-4 using OPNET over the WLANs in terms of throughput, impacts of multiple MPEG-4 streams, and compression rate on throughput. Our simulation results show that a higher throughput does not always yield a better quality MPEG-4 video. We further observe that if an I frame of MPEG 4 video is lost, the next N-1 frames (all P and B frames) are useless [where N is the total number of frames contained within one group of picture (GoP)]. Furthermore, we observe that the I, P, and B frames are in decreasing order of importance. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer approach to improve MPEG-4 trans missions over WLANs. In the proposed approach: 1) P and B frames will be discarded by the MPEG-4 decoder at the receiver's medium access control (MAC) layer if the corresponding I fame is lost; 2) the individual MPEG-4 frames are prioritized at the MAC layer so that I frames have a higher priority than P frames, which have a higher priority than the B frames; 3) each frame (I, B, P) has a time deadline field so that if the deadline cannot be reached, the frame and other related P and B frames in the same GoP are deleted without further transmissions/re-transmissions; and 4) if the delay between an I frame and the next P frame is too long, then it may be better to drop the least important B frames in an attempt to allow the video to catch up. Finally, we study MPEG-4 transmissions over the IEEE 802.11e WLANs, and we adopt a measurement admission control scheme for IEEE 802.lie.

A MANET is a self-configuring and spontaneous network that is established without any administrative management and without fixed infrastructure. Due to its nature, a MANET becomes vulnerable to many attacks, and in particular, Denial of Service (DoS). DoS overwhelm the network and deprive legitimate users from using network resources. There are many methods to mitigate this attack, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and filtering. Each defence method has some benefits and limitations. In this paper, a description of the components of an ideal system to mitigate DoS attacks is presented which will help to design a new method to detect this attack with certainty in MANETs.","","978-0-9893-1933-1;9780989319331","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918239","Denial of service;Distributed denial of service;Intrusion detection system;MANET;ad hoc","Ad hoc networks;Computer crime;Firewalls (computing);Mobile computing;Routing protocols","computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks","DoS attacks;MANET;defence method;denial of service;legitimate users;mitigation methods;mobile ad hoc network","","2","","30","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing works have mainly focused on controller design under network normal operation, which might be inadequate to the threats of DoS attacks. In this paper, the authors present two mitigation measures from the viewpoint of network intrusion detection and response. The basic idea is that the routers close to the attack sources actively drop the attack traffic or lower-priority traffic to protect the resource for the legitimate application traffic. The simulation results indicate that the proposed defense measures are effective for ameliorating the NBCS performance degradation. We suggest that a plausible direction for the security of NBCS may combine the proposed network defense measures with specific controller design to compensate for delay jitter/packet loss.","","0-7803-8730-9;0780387309","","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432165","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;Jitter;Loss measurement;Niobium compounds;Stochastic systems;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;control system synthesis;delays;jitter;microcontrollers;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;control signal transmission;delay jitter;denial of service attack;mitigating performance;network defense;network intrusion detection;network router;network traffic;network-based control system security;sensor measurement;stochastic delay","","1","","11","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead.

These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

Moreover, it uses only local information thereby ensuring scalability. Our light-weight IDS takes care of two kinds of attacks, namely, the blackhole attack and the grey hole attack.

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","16","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4;9781479968954","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","1","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The standard approach for implementing a wireless sniffer is to setup a device in the so-called Promiscuous mode. In this mode, devices are able to acquire all traffic that passes through them, independently from its destination. On a wireless network, this means that it is possible to monitor all the activities inside the device's cover range. Unfortunately, the Promiscuous mode limits the use of the device by prohibiting the association with wireless networks, or in general, sending data. This limitation restricts uses of sniffers on specific scenarios. This paper shows how to remove such limitation by presenting our Laurin Project. Laurin is a wireless sniffer that provides sniffer's capabilities without limiting the device's use. This solution opens the doors to the development of new desktop-oriented applications that take advantage of network monitoring capabilities.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4244-9230-5;9781424492305","978-1-4244-9228-2;9781424492282","10.1109/WD.2010.5657729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657729","IEEE 802.11;Promiscuous mode;RFMON;mac80211;sniffer","Ad hoc networks;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","monitoring;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless networks;IEEE 802.11 wireless sniffers;MAC level;Promiscuous mode;desktop-oriented applications;information acquisition;network traffic monitoring;non-invasive node detection","","0","","23","","","20-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, traffic is getting more concentrated to points such as data centers, and demand for protecting such high-speed networks from attack traffic is increasing. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","","978-1-4244-9127-8;9781424491278","978-1-4503-0379-8;9781450303798","10.1145/1872007.1872032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623834","Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection System;Pre-Filter;Range Hash;Range Matching;Regular Expressions","Complexity theory;Computer aided manufacturing;Data structures;Detectors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Throughput","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","FPGA chips;Internet carriers;Internet traffic demands;Snort signature;character classes;data centers;deep packet inspection;exact strings;high-speed backbone network testing;network intrusions;range hash architecture;regular expression detection;regular expression prefiltering;repetition matching","","2","","45","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6;9781479979806","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we evaluated via simulation the impact of a passive attacker, a denial of service (DoS) attack, and a data swallowing attack. We compared two different adaptive network responses to these attacks against a baseline of no response for 10 and 20 node networks. Each response reflects a level of trust assigned to the captured node. Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as ""goodput"", i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit. We show that the best network response depends on the mission goals, network configuration, density, network performance, attacker skill, and degree of compromise.","","0-7803-8140-8;0780381408","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290104","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Communications technology;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing","ad hoc networks;military communication;telecommunication network routing","adaptive network;data swallowing attack;denial of service attack;on-demand distance vector routing algorithm;passive attacker;system adaptation;tactical ad hoc networks;tactical communications;trust response","","0","","5","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8;9781457714498","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel.

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","35","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones.

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori. Specifically the paper introduces the key concepts of our work and presents the case study built to exercise and set-up our monitor. The case study uses Life ray as application layer and it includes fault injection and data collection instruments to perform extended testing campaigns.","1555-0885;15550885","","","10.1109/ISORC.2014.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899171","SOA;anomaly detection;application server;fault injection;monitoring;testing","Generators;Kernel;Monitoring;Probes;Servers;Service-oriented architecture","fault tolerant computing;operating systems (computers);service-oriented architecture","AS layer;ICT infrastructure;OS layer;SOA;anomaly detection monitors;application server;error detection;fault injection;information and communication technology;operating system;service oriented architectures","","0","","24","","","10-12 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.","2160-4886;21604886","0-7803-9181-0;0780391810","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VisFlowConnect-IP allows an operator to visually assess the connectivity of large and complex networks on a single screen. It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks. In this paper we focus specifically on the design decisions made during the VisFlowConnect development process so that others may learn from our experience. The current VisFlowConnect architecture - the result of these design decisions - is extensible to processing other high-volume multi-dimensional data streams where link connectivity/activity is a focus of study.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), on the other hand, does recognize attacks against the network that firewalls are unable to detect. IDS is designed to be a passive entity that is they are invisible to others on the network but this same capability is a handicap when it comes to blocking malicious packets at runtime, which is an essential feature of a Firewall, as it compromises its passive nature. In this paper a firewall architecture is discussed which uses IDS as a core engine for detecting threats and yet retains the ability to block any packet. The architecture employs hardware software co-simulation in order to process packets in real time. The IDS core is mapped onto an FPGA which is responsible for threat perception while the software implements the pass/block mechanism based on the IDS decision. Inside the FPGA, all the rules are applied in parallel on each packet achieving speedup not possible in software. Using the dynamic reconfigurability of the FPGA, the rule set of the firewall can be changed without stopping it.","","0-7803-8871-2;0780388712","","10.1109/SCONES.2004.1564786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564786","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware design languages;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Runtime","","","","0","","6","","","30-31 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Alternatively, the regex can be converted to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for efficient matching, which however may require an extremely large state transition table (STT) due to exponential state explosion [17, 27]. We propose the segmented regex-NFA (SR-NFA) architecture, where the regex is first compiled into modular nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), then partitioned, optimized, and matched efficiently on modern multi-core processors. SR-NFA offers attack-resilient multi-gigabit per second matching throughput, does not suffer from either backtracking or state explosion, and can be rapidly constructed. For regex sets that construct a DFA with moderate state explosion, i.e., on average 200k states in the STT, the proposed SR-NFA is 367k times faster to construct and update and use 23k times less memory than the DFA approach. Running on an 8-core 2.6 GHz Opteron platform, our prototype achieves 2.2 Gbps average matching throughput for regex sets with up to 4,000 SR-NFA states per regex set.","1089-795X;1089795X","978-1-4577-1794-9;9781457717949","","10.1109/PACT.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113850","NFA;Regular expression;bit-level parallelism;multi-core processor;thread-level parallelism","Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Multicore processing;Throughput;Vectors","backtracking;finite automata;multiprocessing systems","SR-NFA architecture;attack-resilient multigigabit per second;backtracking;deterministic finite automaton;exponential state explosion;large state transition table;modular nondeterministic finite automata;multicore processor;multicore system;regular expression matching","","3","","27","","","10-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries. In this article we propose a novel approach to fully exploit the DMA-based communication mechanisms of the Cell/B.E. to provide an unprecedented level of aggregate performance with irregular access patterns. We have discovered that memory congestion plays a crucial role in determining the performance of this algorithm. We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance.

Furthermore, context awareness has become popular to accompany these services not only to enhance the users' perceived service quality but also to improve the overall utilization of such cooperative networks. However, delivering context-aware multimedia content through these cooperative networks is associated with a significant research challenge due to the inherently different satellites and terrestrial networks technologies. For example, to provide context-specific TV programs to a user, a satellite needs to adopt unicast-style delivery. This may be an expensive operation since satellites are intrinsically useful for broadcasting or multicasting services to a wide audience. In contrast, terrestrial communication networks can be better suited to perform unicast-based context-aware content delivery. In this article, we address these challenges, and propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation method to effectively utilize the satellite and terrestrial networks for providing context-aware contents to many users.

Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.","","978-953-6114-93-1;9789536114931","","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2007.4446129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446129","","Application software;Communication standards;Communications technology;Computer science;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Throughput","DiffServ networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","automatic flow classification;differentiated services;legacy flow classification;machine learning;network standard;packet-level data","","2","","30","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","0","5","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably.

So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8;9781457719318","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey.

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A novel algorithm for pattern matching with back references","L. Yang; V. Ganapathy; P.

In deep packet inspection, the contents of network traffic are matched against patterns of malicious traffic to identify attack-carrying packets. The pattern matching algorithms employed for deep packet inspection must be fast, as the algorithms are often implemented on middle-boxes residing on high-speed gigabits per second links. The majority of patterns employed in network security applications are regular languages. However, regular language-based patterns have limited expressive power and are not capable of describing some complex features in network payload. Back reference is an important feature provided by many pattern matching tools, e.g., PCRE, the regular expression libraries of Java, Perl, and Python. Back references are used to identify repeated patterns in input strings. Patterns containing back-references are non-regular languages. Very little work has been done to improve the time-efficiency of back reference-based pattern matching. The de facto algorithm to implement back reference is recursive backtracking, but it is vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement back references. The basic idea of our approach is to transform a back reference problem to a conditional submatch problem, and represent it with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)-like machine subject to some constraints. Our experimental results show that our approach resists known algorithmic complexity attacks, and is faster than PCRE by up to three orders of magnitude for certain types of patterns.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410264","Back reference;Finite automaton;Network-based Intrusion Detection System;Pattern matching","Resists","finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;security of data","NFA-like machine;back reference-based pattern matching algorithm;conditional submatch problem;de facto algorithm;firewalls;modern network security applications;network-based intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automata like machine;recursive backtracking;regular language-based patterns","","","","28","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2;9781424480012","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics. We perform some experiments to explore the behavior of specific WSN application traffic.

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided.

Both the microcontroller and its associated DFA are implemented on the FPGA. The patterns and software are stored using run-time programmable memory tables. This allows on-the-fly modification to the regular expressions. This paper presents the design details of the regular expression microcontroller and its integration to the DFA state machines. The types of expressions that the system can handle efficiently are discussed as well as the outstanding problems that continue to challenge the community.","1946-147X;1946147X","1-4244-0312-X;142440312X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101008","","Costs;Data security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Microcontrollers;Power system security;Runtime;Throughput","electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;logic design;microcontrollers;reconfigurable architectures;security of data","DFA state machines;FPGA devices;deterministic finite automata;exponential NFA-DFA conversion;intrusion detection systems;network security applications;reconfigurable hardware;regular expression microcontroller;regular expression software deceleration;run-time programmable memory tables","","11","1","22","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most promising ways to provide security is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The heart of almost every IDSs is a string matching algorithm, which is a very computational intensive task. Network Processors (NPs), a specialized multiprocessor, can provide flexibility and high performance for string matching. This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets.","2161-5322;21615322","978-1-4244-1967-8;9781424419678","978-1-4244-1968-5;9781424419685","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493512","","Analytical models;Automata;Computational modeling;Costs;Heart;Internet;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Throughput","security of data;string matching","Internet;analytical performance model;intrusion detection systems;network processors;string matching algorithms","","1","","21","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time.

But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","","978-1-4244-2682-9;9781424426829","978-1-4244-2683-6;9781424426836","10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625475","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Coprocessors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Impedance matching;Information security;Inspection;Pattern matching","computer architecture;coprocessors;logic gates","AND-logic;AND-logic regular expressions;RAM data;Virtex2 devices;Virtex4 devices;content inspection;dot-star;hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture;packet inspection coprocessor;pattern matching;software algorithms","","1","","26","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, performance requirements limit the functionalities of sensors. Therefore, we have developed a high performance multiprocessor architecture which can process passively and online the captured packets in different ways.

Smart grids are quickly spawning in Australia, Europe and North America. Security in smart grids is imperative to protect the functionality of their underlying networks, the data they communicate and the privacy of their customers. However, few research efforts have focussed on security in this area and solutions adopted from traditional ad-hoc networks are not suitable, as they would need to be fully integrated with the grid and its legacy systems before they can yield positive results. The purpose of this paper is dual; to review matters of smart grid security and to examine the effect of hacker attacks on smart grid network parameters. Through simulation we investigate how malicious activity targeting the routing layer of smart grid networks can interrupt network effectiveness.","","978-3-8008-3426-9;9783800834269","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216815","","Logic gates;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","","","","18-20 April 2012","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy. Simulation results manifest that the proposed schemes offer significant energy efficiency and highlight their flexibility.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2217387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296725","Channel awareness;energy efficiency;opportunistic transmission scheduling;optimal stopping","Data communication;Energy consumption;Minimization;Quality of service;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer power supplies;energy consumption;minimisation;stochastic processes;wireless channels","battery lifetime;channel-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling;communication energy consumption;data transmission;distributed scheduler;energy efficiency;energy-efficient wireless link;minimization approach;optimal stopping theory;power level;stochastic characteristic;terminal device;time scheduling strategy;transmission energy consumption;transmission power consumption;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless device","","9","","32","","2012-09-06","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our work focuses on large network while previous works focus on LANs. We proposed rules to choose these routers based on the network topology and based on risk assessment. Many topological factors are considered into the control strategy process, the control router sets selecting algorithm based on entropy was put forward. According to the incidents distribution on the topology, the factor of macroscopic epidemic status is proposed by the method of quantitative and qualitative analysis, which offers administrators the direct decisive advice to prevent network security event from overspreading and minimize the costs.
