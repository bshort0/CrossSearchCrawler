In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.","0738-100X;0738100X","978-1-4244-6677-1;9781424466771","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522352","I/O access control;Virtual machine;smart phone security;virtual machine monitor","Access control;Batteries;Degradation;Equations;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Secure storage;Security;Smart phones","","","","0","","23","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The assumption of nodes cooperation is true only if nodes are trustworthy. However, sometime nodes behave maliciously and selfishly by not cooperating in routing and forwarding processes. The purpose of malicious node is to assault network while the motivation behind selfish node is to save its assets by not cooperating with other, so appropriate security measures must be provided for handling the asserted types of nodes. Trust management is one of the schemes that can be utilized for dealing with the affirmed nodes in MANET.

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A type of wireless network, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous system of mobile nodes where a collection of mobile hosts with wireless network interfaces form a temporary network without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The success of MANET strongly depends on its security. Security is an essential service for wireless network communications especially in mission-critical applications like military applications. A variety of attacks such as Warmhole, Blackhole, Byzantine, Rushing/Flooding, Anonymity/Location Disclosure, Denial of Service etc have been identified and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, existing published solutions typically concentrate on particular type of attacks and are incapable of identifying threats, which occur as a result of combination of these attacks. As overall security level is determined by the system's weakest point, a distributed security scheme that uses an integrated approach to address a combination of these attacks is very much necessary. The work in progress aims to investigate the possible combination of attacks that can be addressed by integrating some of the existing work on mobile ad hoc networks security, which addresses a portion of the security concerns individually. The analysis of attacks and existing mechanisms that would help to design an integrated approach for security services is presented in this paper.","","978-1-4673-8809-2;9781467388092","","10.1109/HMI.2016.7449197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449197","Communication Network Security;MANET Security;Secure Routing;Security Survey","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;attacks analysis;distributed security scheme;mission-critical application;mobile ad hoc network security;mobile host collection;secure routing;wireless network communication","","","","50","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980;11106980","978-1-4244-4214-0;9781424442140","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malicious executables are analyzed using two approaches: disassembly, utilizing IDA-Pro, and the application of a dedicated state machine in order to obtain the set of functions comprising the executables. The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures. Evaluation of F-Sign was conducted under various conditions. The findings suggest that the proposed method can be used for automatically generating signatures that are both specific and sensitive.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2068544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585792","Automatic signature generation (ASG);malware;malware filtering","Binary codes;Grippers;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Real time systems;Software","digital signatures;error detection;finite state machines;invasive software","F-sign;IDA-Pro;automatic extraction;automatic signature generation;common function repository;deep packet inspection;entropy score;false positive detection error;function-based signature generation;high speed network traffic filtering device;intelligent candidate selection;malware;signature candidate list;signature extraction process;state machine","","1","","38","","2010-09-27","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","2","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outlier detection in very large data sets is however computationally very demanding and currently requires high-performance computing facilities. We propose a family of parallel and distributed algorithms for Graphic Processing Units (GPU) derived from two distance-based outlier detection algorithms: the BruteForce and the SolvingSet. The algorithms differ in the way they exploit the architecture and memory hierarchy of the GPU and guarantee significant improvements with respect to the CPU versions, both in terms of scalability and exploitation of parallelism.

The anonymity network Tor is often misused by hackers and criminals in order to remotely control hacked computers.

As more organizations and individuals start to use the cloud to store their data and applications, significant concerns have developed to protect sensitive data from external and internal attacks over internet. Due to security concern many clients hesitate in relocating their sensitive data on the clouds, despite significant interest in cloud-based computing.

IDS (instrusion detection system) has been designed to protect systems from being compromised by network attacks. A lot of researches have been done on it. However, most of them focus on complex and time-consuming detection methods to improve accuracy of the system, with assumption that IDS is running under control of general purpose operating systems (GPOS). In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast. Based on this, we also design a simple IDS and conduct tests by integrating it into SPMOS and GPOS.

We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body.

In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet.

The paper has four main contributions: (i) a new feature extraction algorithm, with low processing demands and suitable for hardware implementation; (ii) a feature selection method with two objectives - accuracy and energy consumption; (iii) detailed energy measurements of the feature extraction engine and three machine learning (ML) classifiers implemented in SW and HW - Decision Tree (DT), Naive- Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN); and (iv) a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs in implementing the feature extractor and ML classifiers in SW and HW.

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","1071-9458;10719458","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","5","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other words, IDS function is limited to detection as well as response. The IDS is unable to capture the state of the system when an intrusion is detected. Hence, it fails to preserve the evidences against the attack in original form. To maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later examination, new security strategy is very much needed. In this research work, automated Digital Forensic Technique with Intrusion Detection System is proposed. Once an IDS detects an intrusion, it sends an alert message to administrator followed by invoke the digital forensic tool to capture the state of the system.

We propose a two-phase indexless search procedure for application in misuse detection-based IDS that makes use of q-gram distance instead of the constrained edit distance. We study how well q-gram distance approximates edit distance with special constraints needed in IDS applications. We compare the performances of the search procedure with the two distances applied in it. Experimental results show that the procedure with the q-gram distance implemented achieves for higher values of q almost the same accuracy as the one with the constrained edit distance implemented, but the efficiency of the procedure that implements the q-gram distance is much better.","","978-0-7695-3324-7;9780769533247","","10.1109/IAS.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627086","Edit distance;Intrusion detection;Misuse detection;Search;q-gram distance","Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Indexing;Information security;Intrusion detection;Testing","database management systems;program testing;security of data;software fault tolerance","attack signatures attack signatures;fault-tolerant distance measures;intrusion detection systems;misuse detection;q-gram distance;time complexity;two-phase indexless search procedure","","0","","7","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Self-configuration enables the system to automatically configure security system and change the configuration of its resources and their operational policies at runtime in order to manage the system security. Our self-configuration approach is implemented using two software modules: component management interface (CMI) to specify the configuration and operational policies associated with each component that can be a hardware resource or a software component; and component runtime manager (CRM) that manages the component operations using the policies defined in CMI.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","1","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They can improve overall network security by pushing protection to the network endpoints. We implemented the following workaround: protecting first the critical mission assets; restrict access to a host but relax access from the host; leverage other available countermeasures.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However there are several significant challenges in securing cloud infrastructures from different types of attacks. The focus of this paper is on the security services that a cloud provider can offer as part of its infrastructure to its customers (tenants) to counteract these attacks. Our main contribution is a security architecture that provides a flexible security as a service model that a cloud provider can offer to its tenants and customers of its tenants.

However, the security policy about the IPv6 network is not mature as the IPv4 network and it becomes an obstacle in the IPv6 network deployment. Up to date, in the main network equipment provider including CISCO, and etc, the IPv6-based firewall is released. However, it nearly does not have the IPv6-based intrusion detection system(IDS) and/or intrusion prevention system(IPS) equipment. Moreover, in the open source, the snort which is the de facto standard of the IDS system yet does not support IPv6. This paper introduces the implementation of intrusion prevention system (IPS) that can be applicable to the IPv6 network and has the multi-thread architecture for the performance improvement. The prototype introduced in this paper is implemented as SW base in order to be applied to the IPv6 network preferentially.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","1","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is intended for hardware implementation and could be included in the network interface, switch or firewall. Efficient implementation in software on a network host is also possible. Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. Results of a preliminary study are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437798","","Computer networks;Counting circuits;Filters;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;security of data;telecommunication security","anomaly detection system;anomaly packet identification;bit-pattern hash function;firewall;high-bandwidth network;machine learning;network interface;network intrusion detection;network traffic","","4","","26","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6;9780769540566","978-1-4244-7143-0;9781424471430","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These models have been used in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and computer security in the literature. In this paper, the authors propose to use Danger models to secure routing in WMNs. The first step in secure routing process is to identify and classify the network dangers and take necessary actions to overcome those dangers. For the classification task, we apply Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) as the classifier to classify the danger levels in WMNs. These identified danger conditions are further deployed as the warning signals for the design of secure routing protocol.

Code generation is a technique used to convert data structures or instruction to other forms to obtain greater benefits within execution environments. This study analyzes intrusion detection system (IDS) signatures and discovers character occurrence to be significantly uneven. Based on this property, this study designs a method to generate a string matching source code according to the state table of AC algorithm for embedded network intrusion detection platforms. The generated source code requires less memory and relies not only on table lookup, but also on the ability of processor. This method can upgrade the performance by compiling optimization and contribute to the application of network processors and DSP-like based platforms. From evaluation, this method requires use of only 20% memory and can achieve 86% performance in clean traffic compared to the original Aho-Corasick algorithm (AC).","","978-1-4799-1983-3;9781479919833","","10.1109/ICCSN.2015.7296134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296134","Code Generation;Intrusion Detection System;String Matching","Arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Optimization;Switches;Table lookup;Thyristors","computer network security;digital signatures;program compilers;string matching","AC algorithm;DSP-like based platforms;character occurrence discovery;data structures;embedded network intrusion detection platforms;intrusion detection system signatures;intrusion-signature matching;network security systems;optimization compilation;processor ability;retargetable multiple string matching code generation;table lookup","","","","14","","","6-7 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

Recent advances in biological immune systems showed that the innate part of the system plays a greater role than previously thought. In this paper, this recent development is the corner stone of the new multi-layer model of artificial immune systems. We describe a work in progress to construct a multi-layered defense system composed of two main layers, innate and adaptive layers. This paper describes the multi-layered system layers and components, gives a detailed justification and design considerations of the system components, and shows first results from the innate layer of the system.

First International Workshop on","20080312","2008","","","594","600","Intrusion detection system (IDS) has been introduced and broadly applied to prevent unauthorized access to system resource and data for several years. However, many problems are still not well resolved in most of IDS, such as detection evasion, intrusion containment. In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the security policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.","","978-0-7695-3090-1;9780769530901","","10.1109/WKDD.2008.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470467","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Open source software;Prototypes;Software engineering","authorisation;software architecture;virtual machines","detection evasion;intrusion containment;intrusion detection domain;intrusion detection system;security policies;system resource;unauthorized access prevention;virtual machine monitor","","2","","22","","","23-24 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first part of the framework a social network has to be derived for a given community of users. In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose. In the fourth part a DNIDS has to be deployed on a range of ISPs in order to monitor and clean the traffic of the users belonging to the central group. We applied the new framework by deriving the social network of 1000 students, finding the most influential group of users, and analyzing the influence of the deployment of DNIDS using a simulation tool.

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087201","CUDA;GPGPU;Hadoop;NIDS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Ecosystems;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming;security of data","CUDA;Compute Unified Device Architecture;Flume;GPGPU;HBase;Hadoop framework;Hive;NIDS;NVidia;PF-ICF;Pig;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion pattern analytics;log files;network intrusion detection system;network security policy;network traffic;parallel programming model;pattern frequency inverse cluster frequency;score-weight approach;streaming data handling","","0","","15","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2;9781467348652","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures.

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

Intrusion detection is the second mechanism to detect the attacks. Anomaly IDS can be used to detect the abnormal behaviors of the network to find some unknown attacking patterns. This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal.

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating ""hard-LANs"" designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","3","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) such as malware, rootkit, spyware, etc. are more potent to bypass the existing defense mechanisms designed for VM. To address this issue, Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) emerged as a promising approach that monitors run state of the VM externally from hypervisor. However, limitation of VMI lies with semantic gap. An open source tool called LibVMI address the semantic gap. Memory Forensic Analysis (MFA) tool such as Volatility can also be used to address the semantic gap. But, it needs to capture a memory dump (RAM) as input. Memory dump acquires time and its analysis time is highly crucial if Intrusion Detection System IDS (IDS) depends on the data supplied by FAM or VMI tool. In this work, live virtual machine RAM dump acquire time of LibVMI is measured. In addition, captured memory dump analysis time consumed by Volatility is measured and compared with other memory analyzer such as Rekall. It is observed through experimental results that, Rekall takes more execution time as compared to Volatility for most of the plugins. Further, Volatility and Rekall are compared with LibVMI. It is noticed that examining the volatile data through LibVMI is faster as it eliminates memory dump acquire time.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384310","Hypervisor;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Forensic Analysis;Rootkit;Semantic gap;Virtual Machine Introspection","Kernel;Malware;Random access memory;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","digital forensics;invasive software;public domain software;storage management;virtual machines;virtualisation","LibVMI open source tool;advanced persistent threats;captured memory dump analysis;execution time measurement;hypervisor;intrusion detection system;live virtual machine RAM dump;malware;memory forensic analysis tool;rootkit;semantic gap;spyware;virtual infrastructure privileged access;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine volatile artifact analyzers;virtualization environment","","","","28","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods.

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical component of such infrastructure defense mechanism. IDS monitors and analyzes networks' activities for potential intrusions and security attacks. Machine-learning (ML) models have been well accepted for signature-based IDSs due to their learn ability and flexibility. However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (Random Forest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (Random Forest-Backward Elimination Ranking). The features selected by the proposed methods were tested and compared with three of the most well-known feature sets in the IDS literature. The experimental results showed that the selected features by the proposed methods effectively improved their detection rate and false-positive rate, achieving 99.8% and 0.001% on well-known KDD-99 dataset, respectively.","1545-0678;15450678","978-1-4799-4182-7;9781479941827","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888858","feature selection;intrusion detection system;machine learning;random forest","Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Training","Big Data;Internet;computer network security;digital signatures;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes","Internet sites;KDD-99 dataset;RF-BER;RF-FSR;big data IDS;cyber-attacks;enterprise networks;large-scale network intrusion detection system;machine-learning models;machine-learning-based feature selection techniques;random forest-backward elimination ranking;random forest-forward selection ranking;security attacks;signature-based IDSs","","0","","24","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Reconfigurable Platform and Programming Tools for High-Level Network Applications Demonstrated as a Hardware Honeypot","S. M&#x00FC;hlbach; A. Koch","Center for Adv. Security Res.

Together, this often exceeds the capabilities of purely software-based network security systems. As an alternative, hardware acceleration has been employed, e.g., for performing deep-packet inspection and pattern matching as well as general packet-header processing. While such implementations, capable of handling lower protocol layers, have been extensively studied in research and industry, their extension to higher communication layers has only rarely been addressed. Such capabilities, including the application level (OSI Layer 7), are the focus of this work. We present the NetStage platform, employing reconfigurable computing for high-throughput low-latency network processing, as well as associated development tools that allow networking domain experts to easily customize the system. As a use-case, we consider the realization of high-performance attack-resilient honeypots based on NetStage. To this end, we introduce the Malacoda language, its programming tools, and the generated target microarchitecture. We then evaluate the performance of Malacoda-generated vulnerability emulation handlers running on the NetStage platform.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902760","10G;FPGA;Network security;deep packet inspection;network stack","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Routing;Security","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","Malacoda-generated vulnerability emulation handlers;NetStage platform;attack patterns;computer network security;computer system security;deep-packet inspection;hardware honeypot;high-level network applications;high-throughput low-latency network processing;packet-header processing;pattern matching;traffic volume","","0","","69","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
