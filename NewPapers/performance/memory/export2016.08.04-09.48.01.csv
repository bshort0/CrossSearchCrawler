However, wireless communication faces several security threats. Consequently, several security efforts have been exerted to combat the wireless attacks, but unfortunately complete attack prevention is not realistically attainable. Thus, the emphasis on detecting intrusions through a second line of defense, in the form of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is increasing. Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account. Unbiased and reliable evaluation necessarily depends on a well-engineered evaluation methodology. Dealing with this challenge, this paper proposed a holistic methodology for IDSs evaluation in wireless networks. Our methodology includes all necessary and sufficient tasks for IDSs evaluation. Also, we present holistic taxonomies of wireless IDSs and wireless security attacks from the perspective of the IDS evaluator.","","978-1-4577-0458-1;9781457704581","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059954","IDSs evaluation;evaluation methodology;wireless attacks;wireless networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Monitoring;Security;Taxonomy;Wireless networks","radio networks;telecommunication security","holistic methodology;security threats;wireless communication;wireless intrusion detection system evaluation;wireless network security;wireless security attacks","","1","","21","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposed a prototype of security system for surveillance radar network, which is handling the security of communications over the Internet between a radar station to master station. The system is designed to protect the radar data against unauthorized parties. From the previous work, there was a weakness in the pseudorandom number generator. The generated number could not satisfy the randomness, it might be raise a security problem. Thus, Pseudorandom Number Generator (PNRG) using chaos algorithm was added to strengthen the salt cryptographic scheme. The analysis of result will be discussed to obtain the advantages of new system. Finally, a layered security system has been developed by taking advantage of a variety of encryption algorithms to get the best protection for the security of surveillance radar network communication.","","","","10.1109/TSSA.2014.7065947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065947","Identity Based Security(IBE);chaos algorithm;salt cryptography;security system;surveillance radar network","Chaos;Encryption;Internet;Radar;Radar antennas","Internet;chaotic communication;cryptography;random number generation;search radar;ships;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet;PNRG;TCP/IP;chaos algorithm;communication security;local area network;master station;pseudorandom number generator;radar data protection;radar station;salt cryptographic scheme;security system;ship;surveillance radar network communication;vessel traffic","","0","","16","","","23-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The methodology is supported by a tool that automatically generates the circuitry for the given regular expressions, outputting VHDL representations ready for logic synthesis. Furthermore, techniques to reduce the area cost of our designs and maximize performance when targeting FPGAs were included. Experimental results show that our tool is able to generate a regular expression engine to match more than 500 IDS regular expressions (from the Snort ruleset) using only 25K logic cells and achieving 2 Gbps throughput on a Virtex2 and 2.9 on a Virtex4 device.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4244-8454-6;9781424484546","978-1-4244-8455-3;9781424484553","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks can inflict harmful threats to various nodes (SIP proxy servers, User agents, etc) and may cause failure to the SIP system. This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions. We propose a new way of evaluation criteria and a comparative study of the researchers' ideas are being addressed based on the models (if any) used, the network architectures and the results. We however do not judge any of these proposals; instead we give hints on how the attacks on VoIP networks could be further addressed.","","978-1-905824-43-4;9781905824434","","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2014.6880664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880664","DoS/DDoS attacks;IDS/IDPS;Mitigation;SIP;VoIP Defender","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Floods;Proposals;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;signalling protocols","DoS-DDoS attacks;SIP based VoIP systems;Session Initiation Protocol;VoIP networks;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack;security frameworks;voice-over-Internet telephony","","0","","29","","","7-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity of the method to analyze these relationships, the time to complete the analysis, the robustness and trustworthiness of the method are important features to be considered. In this paper, we propose using Extended Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-FCMs) to analyze the relationships between risk factors and risks, and adopting a pessimistic approach to assess the overall risk of a system or a project. E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis. We also suggest a framework for group decision making using E-FCMs. Particularly, we explore the Software Project Management (SPM) and discuss risk analysis of SPM applying E-FCMs.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2011.2134730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756213","Fuzzy cognitive maps;project management;risk analysis","Decision making;Delay effects;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Random access memory;Risk analysis;Software;Taxonomy","decision making;risk analysis;software management","extended fuzzy cognitive maps;group decision making;risk analysis graphical representation;risk impact factor analysis;risk management;software project management","","4","","31","","2011-04-25","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. The efficiency of this method has been evaluated by the data set originated from New Mexico University.","","0-7803-8403-2;0780384032","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382325","","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Speech recognition;Text recognition","artificial intelligence;hidden Markov models;radial basis function networks;security of data","artificial intelligence tool;hard decision process;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;neural network model;profile database;radial basis function model","","1","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight. Most breaches occurring nowadays by power users are considered legitimate access and not necessarily intrusions. Developing a solution for such a problem is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions. AVPS heavily enforces separation of duties, promotes scalability, ease of use and manageability.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070;02780070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","2","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","4","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604","Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator","Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","2","","31","","2014-12-18","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6;9780769533476","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","4","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529478","Software security;anomaly detection;discrete-event systems;finite-state automata","Automata;Discrete event systems;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Programming;Security;Software maintenance;Software testing","discrete event systems;finite state machines;security of data;software engineering","discrete-event systems;intrusion detection systems;legal usage representation;secure software development;software deterministic finite-state automaton","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature. It can also detect low intensity attacks and attack switching behaviors which have been the major shortcoming of most of the existing IDS for Wireless Networks.","","978-1-61284-689-7;9781612846897","","10.1109/ISCI.2011.5959000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959000","Cross Layer Approach;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Mesh Networks;multi layer attacks","Cross layer design;Delay;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Throughput","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","MAC layer attacks;ad-hoc networks;attack switching behaviors;cross layer based intrusion detection system;distributed cross layer approach;encryption software;low intensity attacks;multihop decentralized architecture;multilayer attacks;multilayer security attacks;secure communication;secure routing path;wireless mesh networks;wireless multihop networks","","1","","18","","","20-23 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on ""flow"" concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as ""flow key"". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0;9780769537160","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X;0743166X","1-4244-1047-9;1424410479","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","20","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries.

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET.

Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here.

The proposed approaches use a static sensor node which collects the gathered data from other nodes in its region and send these collected data to AUV when it enters 3-D ZOR, thereby reducing the energy used for transmission. The performance is analyzed and simulation result of new Mobicast protocol shows that the sufficient data delivery rate and low energy consumption.","","978-1-4799-8787-0;9781479987870","","10.1109/ICIICT.2015.7396098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396098","Autonomous Underwater Vehicle;Mobicast;Underwater Sensor Network;Zone of Forward;Zone of Reference","Data collection;Oceans;Routing protocols;Three-dimensional displays;Underwater acoustics;Wireless sensor networks","autonomous underwater vehicles;power consumption;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","3D environment;3D underwater acoustic sensor network;AUV;autonomous underwater vehicle;data collection;data delivery rate;energy consumption;energy preserved mobicast routing protocol;energy saving routing protocol;spatiotemporal solution;static node;static sensor node","","","","14","","","19-20 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","2158-6985;21586985","978-1-4244-6356-5;9781424463565","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","4","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node.

This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network.

A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","6","2","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks.

As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for SANs is to provide secure storage, which implies data integrity and data confidentiality. In this article we propose a solution that addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose a novel security architecture for SAN that uses a secure group communication protocol to provide efficient group keying without involving any centralized servers. This fosters both scalability and fault tolerance.","0163-6804;01636804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2003.1222723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1222723","","Competitive intelligence;Contracts;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Permission;Protection;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks","computer network management;cryptography;data integrity;protocols;storage management","SANs;availability;cryptographic techniques;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;fault tolerance;key management;large-scale storage needs;reliability;scalability;secure group communication protocol;secure storage;security requirements;storage area networks","","3","5","15","","","Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4;0769527884","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security","","0","1","10","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4;9781849199094","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

It takes a comparative less time and good accuracy than the existing classifiers.","","","","10.1109/GCWCN.2014.7030883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030883","Accuracy;Deep Packet Inspection;Intrusion Detection;Performance;Security","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Training","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;computer viruses;data privacy;program testing;protocols;quality of service","DPI;IDS;QoS;Web services;anomaly detection;anti-malware;anti-virus;deep packet inspection;heuristics;in/out based attributes;infrastructure management;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;network privacy;network security;payload traffic;protocol detection;secure network management;security policy","","1","","17","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
