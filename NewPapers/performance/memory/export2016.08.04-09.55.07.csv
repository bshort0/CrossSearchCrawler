In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server. By correlating different streams of events, it is possible to achieve more effective detection of Web-based attacks.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254308","","Application software;Computer hacking;Computer science;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Web sites;computer crime;file servers","Web-based applications;Web-based attacks;WebSTAT intrusion detection system;World-Wide Web servers;operating system-level audit data;server host;sophisticated attack languages","","26","2","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tuning statistical anomaly threat detection engines is a significant challenge that often causes high false alarm rates. Also, many types of threats cannot be crisply defined and the degree of alert (threat level) that can occur with threats is often imprecisely defined.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Past research has shown that collaboration between these networks to share suspicious information is an effective way to detect intrusion. However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure. We propose a peer-to-peer approach for collaborative intrusion detection to address these challenges. Our solution proposes secure data sharing between participants from different organizations using a content based peer-to-peer publish/subscribe mechanism.

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new framework to detect anomalies and to provide early alerts for flooding attacks in backbone networks. Thus allow to quickly react in order to prevent the flooding attacks from strangling the victim server and its access network. The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions.

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Nong Ye; Yebin Zhang; C. M. Borror","Inf. & Syst.

This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","41","3","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the major security attacks in WSN. Jamming a single or cluster of nodes is a type of DoS attack on WSN. In this paper, a novel approach in detecting the physical layer DoS style jamming attack is proposed and analyzed. Here, we propose a method called physical layer jamming identification.

Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans and to solve measurement problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet arrival time (8 ns at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, may perform only a small number of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table requires several megabytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By contrast, our new probabilistic algorithms use little memory and are fast. The reduction in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent counting instances. For example, we replaced the port-scan detection component of the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 to 5.6 MB while maintaining a 99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 s of when the large-memory algorithm would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes four times more memory on port scan detection and eight times more on a measurement application. This is possible because our algorithms can be customized to take advantage of special features such as a large number of instances that have very small counts or prior knowledge of the likely range of the count","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2006.882836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709947","Counting distinct elements;traffic measurements","Computer crime;Computer science;Counting circuits;Hardware;Intrusion detection;NIST;Quality of service;Random access memory;Registers;Spine","Internet;probability;telecommunication links;telecommunication security","DoS attacks;Internet links;bitmap algorithms;high-speed links;intrusion detection system;packet arrival time;port-scan detection component;probabilistic algorithms;probabilistic counting","","38","1","22","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","13","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.","","978-1-4673-8050-8;9781467380508","","10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325234","DDoS Attacks;Flow Base IP Traceback;Network Security;Probabilistic Flow Marking","Computer crime;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Network interfaces;Probabilistic logic","Internet;computer network security","CAIDA archives;IP traceback scheme;IP traceback schemes;Internet;NAT;PFM;anonymous flooding attacks;distributed-denial-of-service attacks;network address translation;probabilistic flow marking;proxy device;security issues;source IP address spoofing;spoofed source IP addresses","","","","20","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.

To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

However, inherent energy limitations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) make the application of most of the state-of-the art MACs unaffordable due to their large computation overhead. Therefore in this paper, in order to cope with this challenging concern, we have proposed a lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code. The primary focus is on making the algorithm lightweight so that on using it in achieving secured communication in energy starved networks like WSNs, the resource constrained nodes can successfully run the algorithm. Detailed security analysis shows that LMAC also thwarts passive attack as well as active attack. Finally the comparative usability of the MAC in the said application domain is worked out and that shows the dominance of LMAC over several state-of-the-art MACs. We claim that on an average LMAC requires 61% less overhead compared to its competitors.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417118","","Algorithm design and analysis;Authentication;Computers;Cryptography;Message authentication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","LMAC;WSN;lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code;wireless sensor network","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block.

An essential part of such a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems. The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers.

Among the possible approaches to improve the current situation, expert systems have been advocated to be an important one. Typical tasks that such expert systems attempt to achieve include finding system vulnerabilities and detecting malicious behaviour of users. We extend our intrusion detection system ASAX with a deductive subsystem that allows us to assess the security level of a software configuration on a real time basis. By coupling the two subsystems-intrusion detection and configuration analysis-we moreover achieve a better tuning of the intrusion detection since the system has only to enable intrusion detection rules that are specifically required by the current state of the configuration.

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation.

(VizSEC 05).","20051114","2005","","","39","46","Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532064","","Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Computer security;Computer worms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Invasive software;Management information systems;Protection;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security","IDGraphs;correlated attack discovery;distributed attacks;flow-level trace;histographs;interactive visualization system;port scanning;statistical intrusion detection system;stealthy TCP SYN flooding;traffic anomaly;worm outbreaks;worm propagation pattern analysis","","7","1","31","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This assumption may be unreasonable in the context of attacks and intrusions. An intruder could compromise any number of the available copies of a service resulting in a false sense of security. The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility. We propose our own framework that is based on some simple principles of graph theory and well-founded concepts in topological fault tolerance, and show that it can not only unambiguously detect any such attacks on the services but is also very hard to subvert.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3168-7;9780769531687","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","37","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the principle that networks should allow users to focus on data, rather than having a reference to a physical location where that data is, the adoption of new paradigms can be justified. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm that gives a potential improvement to content distribution, such as local content caching, which helps to reduce delay and increase delivery speed. From another point of view, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) defines a new Internet architecture where network devices are simple and the control plane is managed by a centralized controller, providing an inexpensive and reliable architecture. This paper presents ContentSDN, an architecture that integrates ICN and SDN, providing transparent in-network caching for content delivery. ContentSDN uses the concept of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), allowing network orchestration and high scalability at runtime. Content caching is driven by manageable policies that can be adjusted according to business needs. The proposed architecture has been evaluated on an emulated environment where multiple users request content through the HTTP protocol.

We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism.

An asynchronous messaging network (or simply messaging network) refers to an overlay network (over LAN, VPN, Internet, etc.) that allows exchanging well-formatted asynchronous messages (typically in XML) between the service providers and consumers in the system. The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems.

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","17","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed.

After the relationship among these six components is built up, the object is no longer passive, but active. Furthermore, some specific objects are introduced into OSDs, these specific objects can enhance the intelligence of OSD. Collaboration of all the iOSDs gives birth to the intelligent OSD Cluster.

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","4","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, ""Art is a lie that shows the truth"" and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility.

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4;9780769539294","978-1-4244-5421-1;9781424454211","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such dependencies provide meaningful information concerning the overall system dynamics and should be explicitly integrated into the burst detection process. Using both synthetic scenarios and two real-world datasets, we compare our method with an existing burst-detection algorithm.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.","","","","10.1109/EDCC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950","IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring","Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters","embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management","SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem","","","","47","","","7-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once a computer is compromised, an attacker may alter files, add new files or delete existing files. The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise. Three types of attacker action are considered: reconnaissance, password modification, and malware download. For each type of action, we evaluated the files to audit using metrics derived from the field of information theory and estimated with the empirical SSH compromise data.","","978-0-7695-3698-9;9780769536989","978-0-7695-3698-9;9780769536989","10.1109/NCA.2009.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190368","Intrusion detection systems;SSH compromise;attacker behavior;empirical analysis;filesystem data;honeypots","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Event detection;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Reconnaissance;Software tools;USA Councils","Bayes methods;authorisation;entropy;file organisation;invasive software;meta data;optimisation;probability","Bayesian metric;data auditing;empirical SSH compromise data;entropy-based metric;file evaluation;filesystem attack activity;filesystem data monitoring;honeypot;information theory;intrusion detection system;malware download;meta data;optimization problem;password modification;probability;reconnaissance action;unauthorized user","","0","","29","","","9-11 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","1060-9857;10609857","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

This paper introduces a novel trust model to evaluate the grid and cloud resources by means of resource broker. The resource broker chooses appropriate grid/cloud resource in heterogeneous environment based on the requirements of user. Our proposed trust management system is implemented with Kerberos authentication and PERMIS (privilege and role management infrastructure standard) authorization to enhance the trust of the broker itself. The proposed trust enhanced resource broker evaluates the trust value of the resources based on the identity as well as behavioral trust. The proposed model considers metrics suitable for both grid and cloud resources. The results of the experiments show that the proposed model selects the dependable and reliable resources in grid and cloud environment.","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4244-4786-2;9781424447862","978-1-4244-4787-9;9781424447879","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5378187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5378187","Authentication;Authorization;Reputation;Role based Access Control;Trust","Authentication;Authorization;Availability;Clouds;Educational institutions;Environmental management;Information science;Resource management;Security;Technology management","Internet;authorisation;grid computing;message authentication","Kerberos authentication;PERMIS;authorization;cloud infrastructure;cloud resources;distributed environment;grid computing;privilege and role management infrastructure standard;resource broker;resource provider;trust management system","","9","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
