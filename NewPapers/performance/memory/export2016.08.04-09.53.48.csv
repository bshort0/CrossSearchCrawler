Not only it provides various services to users (e.g. calls, instant messaging, internet conferencing etc), but it is also in a process of extending services (e.g. fax service). Due to the open environment of packet switched network, the signaling protocols (such as SIP and H.323) and the transport protocols (e.g. RTP and SRTP) used by VoIP, it is prone to unwanted accesses and does not comply with the security standards. VoIP is also vulnerable to threats from TCP/IP and UDP. Furthermore, the malicious users can exhaust proxy and end users with INIVTE flooding in SIP. In order to overcome these challenging issues, we propose a simple and robust method to detect INVITE flooding on the SIP proxy server by a strategic proxy model that is based on a user-specified threshold. This model is based on the traffic pattern of normal VoIP traffic and the attacked traffic pattern. Unlike considering only stateful proxies, our model is works for both stateless and stateful proxies.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-9539-9;9781424495399","","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982572","","Computer crime;Estimation;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IP networks;Internet telephony;packet switching;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","H.323;INIVTE flooding;SIP proxy server;SRTP;TCP/IP;UDP;VoIP technology;attacked traffic pattern;end users;flooding attack;malicious users;normal VoIP traffic;packet switched network;security standards;signaling protocols;stateful proxy;stateless proxy;strategic proxy model;strategy based proxy;transport protocols;unwanted accesses;user agent;user-specified threshold;voice over IP technology","","4","","18","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So a weighted LS-SVM (WLS-SVM) based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is presented, which builds a mixed kernel function, adds self adapting weights in LS-SVM, and solves the linear system of equations with QPSO algorithm. It can increase the performance of LS-SVM, accelerate the rate of convergence, save the memory and always get the least square solution.

Recently, a new self-learning strategy for selecting target addresses during malware propagation was introduced in [1], which we refer to as importance scanning. Under the importance-scanning approach, malware employs an address sampling scheme to search for the underlying group distribution of (vulnerable) hosts in the address space through which it propagates. The malware utilizes this information to increase the rate at which it locates viable addresses during its search for infection targets. In this paper, we introduce a strategy to combat importance scanning propagation.We propose the use of white hole networks, which combine several existing components to dissuade, slow, and ultimately halt the propagation of importance scanning malware. Based on analytical reasoning and simulations using real trace and address distribution information, we demonstrate how the white hole approach can provide an effective defense, even when the deployment of this countermeasure represents a very small fraction of the address space population.","","978-1-4244-0974-7;9781424409747","978-1-4244-0975-4;9781424409754","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550340","","Aggregates;Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer worms;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Routing;Sampling methods","","","","2","","38","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two systems would complement each other to produce a detection system with a high probability of detection and low false alarm rate. The performance of Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) is often poor at sites with long perimeters, with extreme weather conditions and requiring a high probability of detection. Video based detection systems (ISM and VMD) are improving in sophistication and performance. Despite this there are still limitations with video based defection. Firstly, it may be several years before the video PIDS achieve the performance required for long perimeters. Secondly, when there is no video, for example in fog, there is no detection. There is potential for combining video detection with another sensor to reduce the disadvantages of video whilst retaining its advantages. A non-video SIDS would be used to detect intrusions. On alarm a sequence of CCTV images would be captured by a loop framestore system. A Targeted Automatic Verification Aid (TAVA) would then be used to decide if there was suspicious activity in the alarm sequence. Many false alarms have no visible cause, so a TAVA would filter these out. The false alarm rate would be lower than with a normal VMD as a TAVA would need to assess only alarm sequences. If there is no video or it is too foggy the TAVA would `fail safe' by signalling the alarm from the non-video PIDS. A TAVA could use more sophisticated processing than a VMD and still be cheaper, because it could target the processing. PSDB is planning to collect alarm sequences from sites with a non-video PIDS and a loop framestore connected to the CCTV system. These sequences will be used to prove the concept and evaluate the performance of a TAVA","","0-7803-2627-X;078032627X","","10.1109/CCST.1995.524734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=524734","","Clouds;Costs;Face detection;Intelligent systems;Monitoring;Protection;Rain;Smart cameras;Sun;Vegetation mapping","closed circuit television;safety systems;video signal processing","AMETHYST;CCTV images;enhanced detection system;intelligent scene monitoring;loop framestore system;nonvideo detection systems;perimeter intrusion detection system;targeted automatic verification aid;video detection;video motion detection","","5","2","7","","","18-20 Oct 1995","18 Oct 1995-20 Oct 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2;9781457714542","978-0-7695-4521-9;9780769545219","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents methods for isolating the malicious traffic by using a honeypot system and analyzing it in order to automatically generate attack signatures for the Snort intrusion detection/prevention system. The honeypot is deployed as a virtual machine and its job is to log as much information as it can about the attacks.

It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized. For application models, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show that attacks using telnet connections in the DARPA data set form a population which is statistically different from the normal telnet connections.

Host-based intrusion detection offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of processes inside the host, providing an important complement to network-based surveillance. Suites of eXpert-BSMs may be deployed throughout a network, and their alarms managed, correlated, and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services, thus helping to address issues of decentralized management. Inside the host, eXpert-BSM is intended to operate as a true security daemon for host systems, consuming few CPU cycles and very little memory and secondary storage. eXpert-BSM has been available for download on the Internet since April 2000, and has been successfully deployed in several production environments.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991540","","Data security;Electronic switching systems;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Remote monitoring;Secure storage;Sun;Surveillance;Trademarks","computer network management;expert systems;network operating systems;security of data;system monitoring","Internet;Sun Solaris;audit trails;decentralized management;eXpert-BSM;host-based intrusion detection;knowledge base;misuse;real time forward-reasoning expert system;security daemon;security services;system operator","","6","35","23","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics. Simulation of these classification models has been performed using 10-fold cross validation.

This distributed security can effectively counteract attacks from intruders or insiders. Three policy-update mechanisms are evaluated for achieving dynamic security. Mobile agents are shown most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents or hosts. The CORBA has the best speed performance with lower overhead The Java-based RMI demonstrates the highest security based on the sandbox model.

Through the OpenFlow protocol, a SDN controller instructs an OpenFlow switch to perform specific actions, such as service chaining, according to header fields of incoming packets. Our main goal is to support an extended view of the OpenFlow architecture by inspecting not only the packet header but also the payload information in the packets. For this purpose, we address a sophisticated packet forwarding scheme using DPI to inspect effectively all incoming packets. According to the results of our experiments, we choose the inside of a virtual switch as the most suitable position of the DPI module. In our scheme, there are a log server, a monitoring application, and DPI function for monitoring and managing network traffic. When the DPI module detects a predefined string pattern of bits in an incoming packet, the switch sends the matching information to the log server that stores logs that contain the detected pattern and resource usage. Then, the monitoring application periodically gathers log information on the log server to compare that information with predefined network policies.

In this paper, we propose an accurate signature generation system for zero-day polymorphic worms. We have designed a novel Double-honeynet system, which is able to detect zero-day polymorphic worms that have not been seen before. To generate signatures for polymorphic worms we have two steps. The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster. The Multilayer Perceptron Model is used to generate signatures for each cluster. The main goal for this system is to reduce the false positives and false negatives.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836623","Algorithm;Honeynet;Machine Learning;Polymorphic;Worms","Clustering algorithms;Computers;Grippers;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Multilayer perceptrons;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;digital signatures;invasive software;multilayer perceptrons;pattern clustering","Internet security systems;automated signature generation method;double-honeynet system;false negatives;false positives;k-means clustering algorithm;multilayer perceptron model;zero-day polymorphic worm detection","","0","","21","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"When Bloom Filters Are No Longer Compact: Multi-Set Membership Lookup for Network Applications","Y. Qiao; S. Chen; Z. Mo; M.

This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem, called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection, the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs. However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom filters--which were originally designed for encoding binary membership information--are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter, we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2536618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431999","Computational efficiency;approximation algorithms;compression algorithms.","Arrays;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Memory management;Random access memory","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With the change of the self, error detection rate increases sharply. A recently developed hypothesis in immunology, the Danger Theory, states that our immune system responds to the presence of intruders through sensing molecules belonging to those invaders, plus signals generated by the host indicating danger and damage. Integrating the ldquoDanger Theoryrdquo, negative selection and immune memory, the paper proposes a novel artificial immune model for intrusion detection. The paper considers the coordination of DCs in the innate immune system and T cells in the adaptive immune system. At the same time the paper focuses on how to define ldquodanger signalsrdquo and considers whether to have a danger to the protected system as the basis of defining ldquoself-nonselfrdquo, in which the self is dynamically updated. The theory analysis shows that the dynamic self can improve the problem of error detection rate increasing sharply, and the dual detection method of DCs detecting the behaviors of antigens and T cells detecting the antigens can also significantly decrease error detection rate.","","978-0-7695-3490-9;9780769534909","","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756899","","Application software;Change detection algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Conferences;Distributed control;Immune system;Industrial training;Intrusion detection;Protection","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithms;security of data","adaptive immune system;artificial immune model;danger theory;error detection rate problem;intrusion detection model","","2","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed wireless sensor networks have problems on detecting and preventing malicious nodes which always bring destructive threats and compromise multiple sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Detection system is implemented based on learning automata concept.

Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks. The implementation is carried out on an experimental testbed build up on Linux machines and Virtual routers.

This complexity made the desire for more sophisticated tools to watch and troubleshoot network traffic. Network traffic monitoring is can be quite a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks and provides a graphical display of network statistics. While collecting information through the network's data stream, network monitor displays the source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network, the destination address of the computer that received the frame and also the protocols employed to send the frame. The procedure through which network monitor collects this information is known as Capturing. Automatically, the network monitor gathers statistics on all of the frames it detects on the network into a capture buffer that is a reserved storage area in memory. To capture statistics on merely a specific subset of frames, we could discriminate these frames by designing a capture filter. To work with network monitor, the computer will need to have a network card that supports promiscuous mode. This paper targets on the usage of packet capturing library Jpcap for monitoring, analyzing and reporting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICCSA.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976660","DDoS Attacks;Intrusion Detection;Jpcap;Packet Capture;Sniffer","Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Libraries;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Protocols","application program interfaces;computer network security;computerised monitoring;graphical user interfaces;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;Jpcap API;capture filter;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;local area networks;network diagnostic tool;network statistic graphical display;network traffic monitoring;packet capturing library;promiscuous mode;protocols;reserved storage area","","0","","11","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major concerns of the development is its latency delay. Host-based IDS systems inspecting log files provided by operating systems or applications need more time to analyze log content. It demands a large number of computer resources, such as CPU time and memory. Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS. It is a self-organized and self-training system. Furthermore, we discover cooperative attacks submitted by users at the same time by using data mining and forensic techniques.","","0-7803-7882-2;0780378822","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297623","","Application software;Computer displays;Data mining;Delay;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Real time systems","computer crime;data mining;real-time systems;safety systems","data mining;forensic techniques;host-based real-time intrusion detection system;intelligent monitor;user profile","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the new viruses seen today aren't advancements in their own right; rather, they have just taken advantage of advancements in technology. And the sophistication of infection techniques and vectors used by viruses these days are on the rise. With a recent increase in network file-infecting viruses, it's high time we revisit the traditional techniques used to detect virus-like activity on the network and improve them. This paper proposes using virtual area networks (VLANs) technology to mass deploy a SAMBA based honeypot to the entire site.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a method that explores transmission vulnerabilities of the encrypted traffic allowing its detection. Hence, an experimental test bed was created to capture a diversity of traffic, which includes flows of a widely used P2P media streaming application called Goal Bit.

In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks. In this paper, we show that the robustness and reliability of generic SIP servers is inadequate than commonly perceived. We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks.

As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. The smartphones have less storage and computational power to put into effect highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection.

The paper focuses on the special case where video is protected by Forward Error Correction mechanisms, which allow reordering of the original packet sequence after it may have been altered by network impairments.

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","978-1-4673-8314-1;9781467383141","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature.

Neural networks method is a promising technique which has been used in many classification problems. The neural network component will implement the neural approach, which is based on the assumption that each user is unique and leaves a unique footprint on a computer system when using it. If a user's footprint does not match his/her reference footprint based on normal system activities, the system administrator or security officer can be alerted to a possible security breach.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generated by exploiting these vulnerabilities have performance impact on both victim as well as on other hosts sharing the communication path. Hence in order to protect the computational and bandwidth resources of the shared path, the anomalies caused by these attacks are to be detected and the attack traffic should be filtered out from the network elements. Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count.

This paper presents a self-organizable architecture, which can reorganize and reconfigure a system based on modular agents. It is contrived through observation of biological phenomena, and implements a platform to host the architecture in dynamically changing environments. We draw several key features of the modular agents, describe the principles of the modular agent-based self-organizable framework, and depict how the proposed framework satisfies the functional requirements of network applications, which are made of several agents.

The result is then applied with a predefined threshold in order to create efficient intrusion detection. We validated our method against the KDD'99 dataset.

We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio.

By exploiting these vulnerabilities, researchers have also discovered a number of security attacks that can be launched on IEC61850 substation network.

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate interaction partners. A distributed, node-centric approach to reputation management processes nodal behavior feedback and provides a reputation index that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The availability of a reputation index gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance, and makes a MANET a more distributed operational environment.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495969","","Access control;Availability;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Environmental management;Feedback;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Waste management","ad hoc networks;authorisation;computer network management;groupware;mobile radio;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc collaborative environment;decentralized trust-based access control system;distributed node-centric approach;distributed operational environment;dynamic collaboration;interaction partners;mobile ad hoc network;nodal behavior feedback;offline management;peer trustworthiness;reputation index;reputation management;sociological trust;trust management","","6","","28","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, research on embedded system security, in general, and intrusion detection, in particular, has not kept pace. Embedded systems are, by nature, application specific and therefore frameworks for developing application-specific intrusion detection systems for distributed embedded systems must be researched, designed, and implemented. In this paper, we present a configurable middleware-based intrusion detection framework. First, we present a system model and a concrete implementation of a highly configurable intrusion detection framework that is integrated into MicroQoSCORBA, a highly configurable middleware framework developed for embedded systems. Our framework autogenerates application-specific intrusion detection systems by exploiting application-specific information accessible to the middleware framework (e.g., object interfaces and method signatures). Next, a set of configurable intrusion detection mechanisms suitable for embedded systems is presented. A performance evaluation of these mechanisms is presented at the end of the paper.","1545-0678;15450678","0-7695-2328-5;0769523285","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437169","","Data security;Distributed computing;Embedded system;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Microprocessors;Middleware;National security;Power system security;SCADA systems","distributed object management;embedded systems;middleware;quality of service;security of data","MicroQoSCORBA;configurable middleware-based intrusion detection framework;distributed embedded systems;embedded system security","","1","","32","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hypervisor is a pillar of virtualization and it allows sharing of resources to virtual machines. Vulnerabilities present in virtual machine leveraged by an attacker to launch the advanced persistent attacks such as stealthy rootkit, Trojan, Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack etc. Virtual Machines are prime target for malignant cloud user or an attacker to launch attacks as they are easily available for rent from Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Attacks on virtual machine can disrupt the normal operation of cloud infrastructure. In order to secure the virtual environment, defence mechanism is highly imperative at each virtual machine to identify the attacks occurring at virtual machine in timely manner. This work proposes In-and-Out-of-the-Box Virtual Machine and Hypervisor based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for virtualized environment to ensure robust state of the virtual machine by detecting followed by eradicating rootkits as well as other attacks. We conducted experiments using popular open source Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) called Open Source SECurity Event Correlator (OSSEC). Both Linux and windows based rootkits, DoS attack, Files integrity verification test are conducted and they are successfully detected by OSSEC.","","","","10.1109/TAFGEN.2015.7289570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289570","Cloud Computing;DoS Attack;Hypervisor;Intrusion Detection and Prevention System;Rootkit;Virtual Machine;Virtualization","Computer crime;Databases;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","Linux;cloud computing;computer network security;formal verification;virtual machines","CSP;DDoS attack;HIDS;IT Infrastructure;Linux;OSSEC;Windows based rootkits;cloud computing;cloud infrastructure;cloud service provider;defence mechanism;distributed denial of service attack;files integrity verification test;hypervisor;intrusion prevention system;open source host based intrusion detection system;open source security event correlator;persistent attacks;resource sharing;stealthy rootkit;trojan;virtual machines;virtualization technology;virtualized cloud environment","","","","25","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
