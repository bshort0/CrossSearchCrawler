A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.

We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naïve model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection.

This paper examines the spread of a class of hitlist-based worms that attempt to propagate by searching for address book files on the host system and using the host's mail program to spread to the addresses found. This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms.

With recent advances in the performance and viability of using GPUs for various highly-parallelised data processing tasks, a number of security challenges are raised. Unscrupulous software running subsequently on the same GPU, either by the same user, or another user, in a multi-user system, may be able to gain access to the contents of the GPU memory. This contains data from previous program executions. In certain use-cases, where the GPU is used to offload intensive parallel processing such as pattern matching for an intrusion detection system, financial systems, or cryptographic algorithms, it may be possible for the GPU memory to contain privileged data, which would ordinarily be inaccessible to an unprivileged application running on the host computer. With GPUs potentially yielding access to confidential information, existing research in the field is built upon, to investigate the practicality of extracting data from global, shared and texture memory, and retrieving this data for further analysis. These techniques are also implemented on various GPUs using three different Nvidia CUDA versions. A novel methodology for digital forensic examination of GPU memory for remanent data is then proposed, along with some suggestions and considerations towards countermeasures and anti-forensic techniques.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140493","","Digital forensics;Graphics processing units;Memory management;Random access memory;Remanence","digital forensics;graphics processing units;memory architecture;parallel architectures;pattern matching","CUDA graphics processing units;GPU memory;Nvidia CUDA GPU;antiforensic techniques;confidential information access;cryptographic algorithms;data remanence;data retrieval;digital forensic;financial systems;global-shared texture memory;highly-parallelised data processing tasks;host computer;intrusion detection system;memory attacks;multiuser system;offload intensive parallel processing;pattern matching;privileged data;program executions;unprivileged application","","0","","24","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally, without any need to understand or modify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossible to recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented as active middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomic services via an attached feedback loop that provides continual monitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair.

This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm. Thus, the speed gain of the proposed scheme is around 100-300 %.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150924","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Data structures;Design engineering;Hardware;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","Super-Symbol Filter;network intrusion detection systems;network security;non-computational intensive pre-filter;pattern matching;search filter;string matching","","3","","14","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Owing to the effective knowledge sharing among multiple analysis engines, the integrated engine is theoretically guaranteed performing more effective than a centralized analysis system.

The determination of this route is a complex one, and requires research into the best metrics to identify the best path, such as memory capacity, network performance, processing capabilities, cost, and so on. One model is to use a mixture of mobile and static agents to gather relevant information. These agents could perform important tests, which could be used to generate the best route through a network.

In order to have a functional UWSN to extract the authentic data safeguarding and protection mechanisms are crucial. Malicious node attacks has accomplished as one of the most challenging attacks to UWSN. Several research has been conducted to protect UWSN from malicious attacks but majority of the works depend on either training data set or a previously defined threshold. Without an established security infrastructure a UWSN required to detect the malicious attacks is a complication and challenge.

Hence, specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms are required for line-speed packet processing. We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory.

Since the 1960s, operating systems designers have explored how to build ""secure"" operating systems - operating systems whose mechanisms protect the system against a motivated adversary. Recently, the importance of ensuring such security has become a mainstream issue for all operating systems. In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements. For system designs that aimed to satisfy these requirements, we see that the complexity of software systems often results in implementation challenges that we are still exploring to this day. However, if a system design does not aim for achieving the secure operating system requirements, then its security features fail to protect the system in a myriad of ways. We also study systems that have been retrofit with secure operating system fe tures after an initial deployment. In all cases, the conflict between function on one hand and security on the other leads to difficult choices and the potential for unwise compromises. From this book, we hope that systems designers and implementors will learn the requirements for operating systems that effectively enforce security and will better understand how to manage the balance between function and security.

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron.

Numerous fault-tolerant approaches have been proposed to effectively achieve this objective in the presence of crash failures. However, such systems struggle with transient late-timing faults -- a fault classification challenging to effectively tolerate -- that manifests increasingly within large-scale distributed systems. Such faults represent a significant threat towards minimizing soft real-time execution of streaming applications in the presence of failures. This work proposes a fault-tolerant approach for QoS-aware data prediction to tolerate transient late-timing faults. The approach is capable of determining the most effective data prediction algorithm for imposed QoS constraints on a failed stream processor at run-time. We integrated our approach into Apache Storm with experiment results showing its ability to minimize stream processor end-to-end execution time by 61% compared to other fault-tolerant approaches. The approach incurs 12% additional CPU utilization while reducing network usage by 44%.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515618","Cloud computing;Data Prediction;Fault-tolerance;Stream Processing","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3;9781424417513","","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate different methods to detect and classify intrusion from normal network packet. Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment.

Thus, researchers have developed high performance parallel deep packet filters for reconfigurable devices. Although some reconfigurable systems can be generated automatically from pattern database, obtaining high performance result from each subsequent reconfiguration can be a time consuming process.

Frequently, the transfer function is designed based on mapping one or two dimensional space to color properties (RGB) and opacity (A). We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. We compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. We apply a semi-automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","2164-4357;21644357","978-1-4673-5137-9;9781467351379","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method enhances the centralized management mechanism, where a controller reactively installs rules based on receiving the first packet of each flow, to reduce the load in the controller by decreasing the packets transmitted to the controller for packet inspection. The main feature of this method is that the gateway function redirects unknown packets to another gateway function instead of the controller, and the matched rules are installed in every gateway function on the redirection path using reverse-path forwarding. Using a simulation system, we showed that the enhanced method can reduce the number of packets arriving at the controller per unit time by ~ 62% under our use case assumption.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414122","","Inspection;Logic gates;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Servers;Virtualization","internetworking;mobile radio;network servers;telecommunication network management;virtualisation","gateway function;gateways scalable management;mobile network virtualization;packet inspection;redirection-based rules sharing;reverse-path forwarding;simulation system","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157;07303157","978-1-4244-7512-4;9781424475124","978-0-7695-4085-6;9780769540856","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we survey and classify the solutions that have been proposed in the literature for this attack and propose a decentralized scheme for intrusion detection based on the theory of diffusion of innovations.

In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained. Cost - Benefit analysis is done for the various attack detection methods and the ROC curves are also plotted.","","978-1-4673-5037-2;9781467350372","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528514","Attack Detection;Classification;Cost-Benefit Analysis and ROC Curve;Intrusion Detection;Layered Approach","Accuracy;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","Bayes methods;cost-benefit analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;trees (mathematics)","CFS;DoS;IDS;J48;KStar;Naïve Bayes;Probe;R2L;ROC curves;RandomSubspace;RotationForest;U2R;correlation based feature selection;cost-benefit analysis;data near BalancedND;enhanced attack detection methods;feature selection;information assets;intrusion detection systems;layered approach;multiclass classifier;multiple learning based classifiers;ordinal class classifier;random forest;random tree;security infrastructure;security systems;system administrators","","1","","7","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The support in business and private activities will take place through the userpsilas own personal network consisting of a core Personal Area Network (PAN) extended with clusters of remote devices which could be private, shared, or public and able to adapt to the quality of the network accessed. The extended PAN with its cluster communication with another PN forms a Federation of Personal Networks (PN-F). PN-F is a secure cooperation between different PNs, making services and resources available for the purpose of achieving a common goal, increasing the security requirements and challenges. The communication in this scenario can happen in various places (home, work, public places), involving various types of network infrastructure, between various types of hardware, and exchanging any kind of service. Context aware security manager (CASM) has been proposed to solve the PN security issue, putting all the security decision in the gateway between PAN and cluster or PN and another PN. CASM relies on providing security policy based on the context being given by user. So far, algorithm regarding how to input the context has not yet been defined. Furthermore, how CASM react upon the context in deciding what security action should be performed has also not yet been elaborated. This paper will analyze the impact of context to security. The paper will work as a continuation of CASM by elaborating further a proposed algorithm on defining the context parameters, quantifying context parameter so that CASM can make decision upon it, and optimizing the matrix of context information.","2166-9570;21669570","978-1-4244-2643-0;9781424426430","978-1-4244-2644-7;9781424426447","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699962","Ad Hoc Network;Communication System Security;Personal Communication Network;Protocols","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Communication system security;Context awareness;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Personal area networks;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","internetworking;personal area networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","business activity;context aware security manager;context information matrix;decision making;gateway;personal area network security;private activity;remote device","","0","","9","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These include tools for e-discovery, commercial intelligence and national security. Thus the industry has seen equally significant developments in computer forensic tools where methods of searching for and detection of, malicious activity for presentation as evidence and provision of trust have become ever more sophisticated. To a considerable degree the science of security and forensics have seen both rapid but separate developments. This paper proposes that there are areas in common between these two important fields of endeavour and sets out techniques and ideas which demonstrate how they can overlap and work together in order to provide improved security and trustworthiness in critical infrastructures.

Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","2324-8297;23248297","978-1-4244-3844-0;9781424438440","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study pipeline sharing, such that a single pipeline can be used to serve several packet types. Pipeline sharing decreases the needed total number of cores, but typically increases pipeline lengths and therefore packet delays. We consider two novel optimization problems of allocating cores between different packet types such that the average or the worst-case delay is minimized. We study the two problems and suggest optimal algorithms that apply under different assumptions on the input. We also present greedy algorithms for the general case.

In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed.

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

By arranging several sensors to deal with the traffic in parallel, the intrusion detection system's speed can be significantly increased. How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7;9781424437467","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluate the possible intrusion scenarios associated with today's commercial middleware platforms and discuss the possible impacts.

One of the techniques that has been widely used for achieving such requirements is the employment of In-Memory Key-Value Storage (IMKVS) as caching mechanisms in order to improve overall user experience. Memcached and Redis are applications that use IMKVS approach. Commonly IMKVS clients use Consistent Hashing to decide where to store an object, which may cause network load imbalance. Furthermore, these clients work only at the application layer, so network conditions are not considered to distribute user's accesses. This paper proposes a new cache architecture with two phases load balancing to improve IMKVS performance, which has adopted a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture to manage the load balancing mechanism. The proposal was evaluated in the Mininet emulation environment and shows an improvement on load balancing giving best user experience.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405549","","Computers;Control systems;IP networks;Load management;Protocols;Servers","computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;social networking (online);software defined networking;virtualisation","Mininet emulation;NFV;SDN;data center;datacenter;in-memory key-value storages;network function virtualization;social networks;two-phase load balancing","","","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Matching a variety of signatures challenges the selection of matching algorithms, as each approach has better performance than others for different signature characteristics. We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality. We also rank the factors to indicate their importance for the string matching performance.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453354","String matching;automaton;filtering;virus scanning.","","automata theory;computer viruses;cryptography;digital signatures;public domain software;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;automata tracking;backward hashing algorithm;characteristic signature;open source ClamAV;string matching;virus scanning","","1","","28","","2010-04-22","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897;10636897","0-7695-2270-X;076952270X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","5","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
