Our focus is on enforcing containment in the system, thus localizing the intrusion and allowing the system to provide service, albeit degraded. ADEPTS uses a graph of intrusion goals, called I-GRAPH, as the underlying representation in the system. In response to alerts from an intrusion detection framework, ADEPTS executes algorithms to determine the spread of the intrusion and the appropriate responses to deploy. A feedback mechanism evaluates the success of a deployed response and uses that in guiding future choices.

To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack.","0190-3918;01903918","978-1-4244-7918-4;9781424479184","978-0-7695-4157-0;9780769541570","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599084","cloud computing;cooperative intrusion detection system;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computer crime;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Simulation","Internet;security of data;software agents","DoS attack;Internet;cloud computing networks;cloud computing region exchange;cooperative IDS system;cooperative agent;cooperative intrusion detection system framework;distributed denial-of-service attack","","26","2","10","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among many network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), open source systems have gained substantial preference due to their flexibility, support and cost effectiveness. Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration). Furthermore, the findings can be applied to other signature based intrusion detection systems for refining their performance and detection capability.","","978-1-4799-1287-2;9781479912872","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725321","Distributes Denial of Service;Network Intrusion Detection System;Network Security;Penetration Testing;Snort;Vulnerability Assessment and Defense","Availability;Computer crime;Floods;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Servers","computer network security;public domain software;transport protocols","DDoS attacks;NIDS;Snort detection capability;Snort packet handling capability;TCP flooding distributed denial of service attack;detection accuracy;hardware configurations;internal architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security;open source systems;rate filtration;signature database","","1","","26","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy. Security reports generated by GHIDS are indexed not only by local user ID, but also by grid user ID.

If such an attack can be found, it implies that the target detector is vulnerable against mimicry attacks. In this work, we emphasize that there are two components of a buffer overflow attack: the preamble and the exploit. Although the attacker can modify the exploit component easily, the attacker may not be able to prevent preamble from generating anomalous behavior since during preamble stage, the attacker does not have full control. Previous work on mimicry attacks considered an attack to completely evade detection, if the exploit raises no alarms. On the other hand, in this work, we investigate the source of anomalies in both the preamble and the exploit components against two anomaly detectors that monitor four vulnerable UNIX applications. Our experiment results show that preamble can be a source of anomalies, particularly if it is lengthy and anomalous.","","978-0-7695-3390-2;9780769533902","","10.1109/PST.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641288","Information hiding;anomaly detection;mimicry attacks;vulnerability testing","Assembly;Buffer overflow;Computer science;Databases;Detectors;Gain control;Information analysis;Monitoring;Privacy;System testing","object detection;security of data","UNIX applications;anomalous behavior;buffer overflow attack;mimicry attacks;target detector","","3","","18","","","1-3 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210;10638210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network.

Unfortunately, it spends the majority of CPU time in packet classification to search for rules that match each packet. A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules. We implement our algorithm in Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that our implementation is faster than original Snort to deal with the same real packet traces while consuming an order of magnitude less memory.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-2389-7;9781424423897","978-1-4244-2390-3;9781424423903","10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674280","","Automata;Databases;Engines;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Tree graphs","cryptography;finite automata;trees (mathematics)","CPU time;Snort;finite automata;graph;hierarchical rule trees;open-source intrusion detection system;packet classification;rule hashing;rule-based intrusion detection system;security threats","","2","","13","","","3-7 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation. We develop a fast, memory efficient algorithm for solving this problem as a variant of the longest common subsequence problem.

First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection.

Therefore, using manpower to search the videos is very unprofitable. Hence, the developments of intelligent surveillance system are very important issue for surveillance system. object segmentation method is most important technique on intelligent surveillance system, because the results of object segmentation can support intelligent surveillance system to detect and monitor Intrusive object. And background subtraction method is very popular of object segmentation. However, background subtraction methods have a problem in initial background extraction when the scene exist slow-speed objects. Because the discrimination between slow-speed objects and background are very difficult. In the paper, we propose a robust initial background extraction algorithm applied to video sequences with a static camera. The algorithm can classify and extract the background effectively. Even in slow-speed objects in the video sequence, the proposed algorithm can extract the initial background by dynamic analysis and maintained the background accurately.","","978-1-4673-1288-2;9781467312882","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269360","Background;initial background detection;object segmentation;subtraction","","","","","0","","8","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.","1091-0050;10910050","978-1-4799-0052-7;9781479900527","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421","","Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security","","1","","20","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node. These results show that the lifespan of sensor network increases and average energy consumed by sensor node decreases.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781305","Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Attack;Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media access Control Protocol (FSMAC);Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol;Security Issues;Wireless Sensor Networks","Frequency division multiaccess;Indexes;Protocols;Receivers;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;cryptographic protocols;decision making;energy consumption;fuzzy logic;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DOS attack;FSMAC protocol;WSN improvement;decision making;denial of service;energy consumption;fuzzy logic secure media access control protocol;human reasoning;intrusion detector parameter;multiple access networks;sensor nodes;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many environments (such as universities), end users relish having control over their own machines. However, if end users administer their own machines, nothing stops dishonest ones from marking undeserving traffic for high QoS. How can an enterprise ensure that only appropriate traffic receives high QoS, while also allowing end users to retain control over their own machines?

Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","2161-4393;21614393","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","29","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level. The proposed framework is composed by an anonymization application programming interface (AAPI). The performance results show that AAPI outperforms existing tools, while offering significantly more anonymization primitives.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","","10.1109/ICC.2006.255113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024508","","Computer science;Credit cards;Data privacy;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web pages","","","","9","","25","","","11-15 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse literature on Cloud Computing risks to emphasise its implications from a personal health information perspective. Access management, security issues, legal issues and loss of data are some of the risks that negatively impact the storing of PHRs in the Cloud. These can be mitigated by ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access; ensuring that users do not gain access to other users' data and that data remains encrypted; Cloud providers should comply to audits in order to make sure that proper regulations are followed in securing data in the Cloud; and making backups in case of data loss. Using Cloud-based PHRs can improve healthcare. Cloud Providers should work together with PHR providers in order to make sure PHR users can reap these benefits without being too concerned about the associated risks.","","","","10.1109/i-Society.2014.7009039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009039","Cloud Computing;information security risks;legislation;personal health records;privacy","Availability;Cloud computing;Information security;Medical services;Organizations","cloud computing;electronic health records;health care;security of data","PHR;cloud-based personal health records;health care;information security risk measure;qualitative content analysis","","0","","40","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity.

In this paper, we present the design, analysis, and evaluation of a cloud service that we refer to as Cybersecurity Lab as a Service (CLaaS) which offers virtual cybersecurity experiments that can be accessed from anywhere and from any device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smart mobile device, etc.) with Internet connectivity. In CLaaS, we exploit cloud computing systems and virtualization technologies to provide virtual cybersecurity experiments and hands-on experiences on how vulnerabilities are exploited to launch cyberattacks, how they can be removed, and how cyber resources and services can be hardened or better protected. We also present our experimental results and evaluation of CLaaS virtual cybersecurity experiments that have been used by graduate students taking our cybersecurity class as well as by high school students participating in GenCyber camps.","","","","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312173","CLaaS;and cloud computing;cybersecurity experiments;education;virtual cloud services;virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Network interfaces;Protocols;Servers","Internet of Things;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;security of data;virtualisation","CLaaS;GenCyber camps;IT infrastructures;Internet connectivity;Internet of things;IoT;cloud computing systems;cloud service;cyber resources;cybersecurity lab as a service;cybersecurity teaching;cybersecurity training;graduate students;virtual cybersecurity experiments;virtualization technologies","","","","26","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we tested the products under two different operating systems. Several experiments were run to evaluate the effects of open source intrusion detection and prevention systems Snort and Suricata, operating systems Windows, Linux and various attack types on system resource usage, dropped packets rate and ability to detect intrusions. The results show that Suricata has a higher CPU and RAM utilization than Snort in all cases on both operating systems, but lower percentage of dropped packets when evaluated during five of six simulated attacks. Both products had the same number of correctly identified intrusions. The results show that Linux-based solutions consume more system resources, but Windows-based systems had a higher rate of dropped packets. This indicates that these two intrusion detection and prevention systems should be run on Linux.

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","10.1145/1185347.1185372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Engines;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Software","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","1","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space. The whole unused addresses in the organization are virtually watched by a small number of the honeypots installed in a special network under the control. By the aggregation of honeypots, honeypots may be supervised well, and the risk of compromise may be reduced. The surveillance system can be established without making alternation in existing network equipments. It selects the address under surveillance autonomously.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%. Finally, both application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed error detection structures are presented to assess their efficiency and overhead.

Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance. So it is worth applying and popularizing.","","978-1-4244-3835-8;9781424438358","978-0-7695-3816-7;9780769538167","10.1109/AICI.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375980","extension clustering;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Delay;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","security of data;support vector machines","extension clustering support vector machine;intrusion detection algorithm;response time","","0","","13","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP header. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we study four practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice.

Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.

The proposed model use multi-layered network architecture with a back propagation learning mechanism to discover and analyze useful knowledge from the available Web log data.","","978-1-4244-8678-6;9781424486786","978-1-4244-8679-3;9781424486793","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941564","Clustering algorithms;Online Learning Algorithm;Soft Computing techniques;Unsupervised Learning algorithm;data mining;intrusion detection system","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Knowledge engineering;Web mining;Web servers","Internet;backpropagation;data mining;neural nets;pattern clustering","K-means clustering algorithm;Web log data;Web traffic mining;backpropagation learning mechanism;competitive learning;data mining;multilayered neural network;neural network learning improvement","","0","","11","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system that fails to perform packet inspection at high rate will allow malicious packets to enter the network undetected. In this paper we demonstrate that the current default configuration of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) is not suitable for Snort's performance. We show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters. In particular, we experimentally study the performance impact of choosing different NAPI budget values on Snort's throughput.

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks. Our method uses Random Forests to build classifiers based on which the incoming slow-read traffic can be detected at the destination.

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done.

Although CC promises to make life much easier for the user, it comes with significant security issues. Because on-demand service provisioning for applications and data will be used by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of users simultaneously, a successful intrusion would not only expose sensitive data, but it could also completely cut users off from both applications and/or data. This paper examines the underlying security risks inherent to the CC paradigm, compares approaches to mitigate known security risks, and offers a solution that leverages intelligent multi-agent systems and network data ontologies to provide automated defense for both known and unknown malware security risks.

First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols.

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2;9789639799592","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","1","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","4","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

NIDS is an efficient way to provide the security protection for today's Internet. Pattern match algorithm plays an important role in NIDS that performs searches against multiple patterns for a string match. Pattern matching is a computationally expensive task. Traditional software-based NIDS solutions usually can not achieve a high-speed required for ever growing Internet attacks. In order to satisfy high-speed packet content inspection, hardware-implementable pattern match algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based pattern match architecture that employs a multi-character processor array. The proposed multi-character processor array is a parallel and pipelined architecture which can process multiple characters of the input stream per cycle. The proposed architecture can reduce a lot of unnecessary computations and thus it is power efficient. We use snort pattern sets and DEFCON packet traces to perform our simulations. Our experiment results show that, with a 3-character processor array, we can reduce 83% of the computations compared with the brute force approach.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-0-7695-3095-6;9780769530956","","10.1109/AINA.2008.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4482814","Snort;intrusion detection;pattern matching;processor array","Application software;Automata;Computer architecture;Computer science;Filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection","Internet;parallel architectures;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","DEFCON packet traces;Internet;attacks identification;hardware-based pattern match architecture;multicharacter processor array;network intrusion detection system;packet content inspection;parallel architecture;pipelined architecture;security protection;snort pattern sets;string matching","","1","1","13","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.","","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2013.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690909","Anomaly Detection;IDS;SCADA;Secure Service","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers","Internet;SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptographic protocols;operating systems (computers)","Internet;abnormal command execution identification;base rule set;communication protocol;dynamically produced rule set;intrusion detection system;m-connected SCADA network vulnerability;m-connected status;national critical infrastructure;network anomaly detection;network protocol;network-based pattern reference method;operating systems;pattern reference model;pre-known intrusion pattern;private network;public network;security model;specific threshold value;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","12","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a centralized controller, the process of updating networks becomes much more convenient when compared to traditional networks. However, even with SDNs, transitional network states during network updates may still cause problems. Such states may result in a breakdown of isolation guarantees or other critical constraints and this could lead to incorrect behavior or even security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel abstraction for network updates, inter-flow consistency, that can account for relationships and constraints among different flows during updates. We present a generic inter-flow consistency constraint, version isolation, and a special case, spatial isolation. We propose update scheduling algorithms based on dependency graphs and a data structure that captures dependencies among different update operations & network elements. We also implemented a prototype system on a Mininet OpenFlow network and Ryu SDN controller to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is able to enforce inter-flow consistency constraints with reasonable overheads and that overheads for version isolation are higher than for spatial isolation. Furthermore, when only spatial isolation constraints are in use, overheads on update times for flows that have no isolation constraints are very small (around 1%).","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346859","","Bandwidth;Communication networks;Conferences;Packet loss;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security","centralised control;computer network security;data structures;graph theory;software defined networking;telecommunication control","Mininet OpenFlow network;Ryu SDN controller;SDN update abstraction;centralized controller;control planes;data planes;data structure;dependency graphs;inter-flow consistency;inter-flow constraints;network updates;security vulnerabilities;software defined networks;spatial isolation;transitional network;update scheduling algorithms;version isolation","","1","","21","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability. We analyze the sensitivity of false alarms with respect to the minimum trust threshold below which a node is considered malicious.

In this paper we advocate the use of a hybrid approach, in which each type of cache acts as a module in a system with shared memory and storage space. A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation. Our results indicate that a hybrid system is able to provide better savings than a proxy cache, or a standalone RE system.

We first show the performance of the image sensor then present how a criticality-based scheduling approach can be adapted and integrated into the image sensor platform taking into account the real hardware constraints and capabilities. We then demonstrate by simulating large-scale configurations that although hardware constraints limit the maximum intrusion detection rate per node, the usage of a low-cost multi-camera system provides much higher detection quality than denser single-camera system working at a higher image capture rate.","","","","10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7348001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348001","Low-cost image sensors;intrusion detection;multi-camera;wireless image sensor networks","Cameras;Image coding;Image sensors;Intrusion detection;Lenses;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","image capture;image sensors;security of data;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication security;video cameras;wireless sensor networks","commercial off-the-shelf components;criticality-based scheduling approach;image capture rate;intrusion detection mechanism;multicamera wireless image sensor","","","","26","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the sheer volume of log data demands new frameworks and techniques of computing and security. We present a lightweight distributed and parallel security log analysis framework that allows organizations to analyze a massive number of system, network, and transaction logs efficiently and scalably. Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design and shows the potential of our cloud-based distributed framework in large-scale log analysis scenarios.","2166-0077;21660077","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824985","","Cloud computing;Conferences;Data privacy;Organizations;Security","cloud computing;distributed processing;security of data;system monitoring","Amazon cloud environments;EC2;MapReduce;S3;cloud-based distributed framework;dynamic task scheduling;log data demands;massive distributed frameworks;organizational security;parallel security log analysis framework;streaming logs;transaction logs","","0","","27","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
