"A Hybrid TCAM + SRAM Scheme for Multi-match Packet Classification","R. Shen; X. Li; H. Li","Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","2379-5352;23795352","978-0-7695-4879-1;9780769548791","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to permit a remote control of domestic devices a bridge between the Internet network and the Home Network is necessary. This function is commonly operated by the Smart Home gateway which thus results a critical point for the security of the network. Recently several general purpose devices exist that are capable of connecting both to the Home Network and the Internet network, leading to have additional, dynamic and unpredictable, bridges between the two networks. This possibility makes such devices additional attack vectors for the Smart Home. In this work we show the risks resulting from such devices. By using an emulated scenario we also demonstrate the implementation of a real attack exploiting a general purpose device connected to both the Internet and the Home Network. Preliminary experimental results are presented confirming the success of our attack.","","","","10.1109/CSE.2015.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371367","Security;Sinkhole;Smart home;Zigbee","Internet;Security;Smart homes;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Internet;computer network security;home automation;internetworking","Internet network;emulated scenario;home automation;home network;network security;smart home gateway","","","","21","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead","1072-4451;10724451","0-7695-2732-9;0769527329","","10.1109/MICRO.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841","","Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime","authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring","anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics","","2","","27","","","9-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, it is difficult to find the exact signature of attack. Moreover, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference between an unusual high traffic which is caused by the attack, and the flash crowds which normally occur when a huge number of users use the target machine at the same time. In fact, this difference should only be observed from analyzing the data in the packet header. In this paper, we propose to discover the DDoS attacking signature by analyzing the TCP/IP packet header against the well defined rules and conditions, and distinguish the difference between normal and abnormal traffic.

In this paper, a new technique is presented that enables the proactive detection of root kits while they are hiding malware, and therefore, allowing that hiding can be avoided. The technique has been designed for root kits that operate in kernel-mode.

Therefore, their design should include improved resilience capabilities to allow them to operate correctly in highly adverse environments. This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes. Furthermore, it accommodates high loads, as it is able to handle sixteen times more security events per second than what was processed by the SIEM employed in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2016.2593442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517292","Application-level firewall;BFT;Denial-of-service;Intrusion Tolerance","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Protocols;Receivers;Resilience","","","","","","","","2016-07-20","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, DDoS attacks are difficult to be quickly detected. In this paper, we introduce a system that only extracts several important attributes from network traffic for DDoS attack detection in real computer networks. We collect a large set of DDoS attack traffic by implementing various DDoS attacks as well as normal data during normal usage. Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods. Only using several attributes also improves the efficiency in terms of attributes constructing, models training as well as intrusion detection.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-3309-4;9781424433094","","10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757464","Bayesian networks;C4.5;DDoS attack detection;Intrusion detection system;attribute selection","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;DDoS attacks;attribute selection;;distributed denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system","","3","","16","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in “zombie” machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441","","IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement","IP networks;Internet;firewalls","IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These efforts have been enriched through a formal approach, e.g., the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework, which is discussed in two earlier volumes in this series. This volume should help advance work not only in DLs, but also in the WWW and other information systems. Drawing upon four (Kozievitch, Murthy, Park, Yang) completed and three (Elsherbiny, Farag, Srinivasan) in-process dissertations, as well as the efforts of collaborating researchers and scores of related publications, presentations, tutorials, and reports, this book should advance the DL field with regard to at least six key technologies. By integrating surveys of the state-of-the-art, new research, connections with formalization, case studies, and exercises/projects, this book can serve as a computing or information science textbook. It can upport studies in cyber-security, document management, hypertext/hypermedia, IR, knowledge management, LIS, multimedia, and machine learning. Chapter 1, with a case study on fingerprint collections, focuses on complex (composite, compound) objects, connecting DL and related work on buckets, DCC, and OAI-ORE. Chapter 2, discussing annotations, as in hypertext/hypermedia, emphasizes parts of documents, including images as well as text, managing superimposed information. The SuperIDR system, and prototype efforts with Flickr, should motivate further development and standardization related to annotation, which would benefit all DL and WWW users. Chapter 3, on ontologies, explains how they help with browsing, query expansion, focused crawling, and classification. This chapter connects DLs with the Semantic Web, and uses CTRnet as an example. Chapter 4, on (hierarchical) classification, leverages LIS theory, as well as machine learning, and is important for DLs as well as the WWW. Chapter 5 on extraction from text, covers document segmentation, as well as how to construct a database from heterogeneous collections of references (from ETDs); i.e., converting strings to canonical forms. Chapter 6 surveys the security approaches used in information systems, and explains how those approaches can apply to digital libraries which are not fully open. Given this rich content, those interested in DLs will be able to find solutions to key problems, using the right technologies and methods. We hope this book will help show how formal approaches can enhance the development of suitable technologies and how they can be better integrated with DLs and other information systems.","","9781627050319","","10.2200/S00566ED1V01Y201401ICR033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813167.pdf&bkn=6813166&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2014","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

This paper describes a technique of applying artificial immune system along with genetic algorithm to develop an intrusion detection system. Far from developing primary immune response, as most of the related works do, it attempts to evolve this primary immune response to a secondary immune response using the concept of memory cells prevalent in natural immune systems. A genetic algorithm using genetic operators- selection, cloning, crossover and mutation- facilitates this. Memory cells formed enable faster detection of already encountered attacks. These memory cells, being highly random in nature, are dependent on the evolution of the detectors and guarantee greater immunity from anomalies and attacks. The fact that the whole procedure is enveloped in the concepts of approximate binding and memory cells of lightweight of natural immune systems makes this system reliable, robust and quick responding.","","978-0-7695-3184-7;9780769531847","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557836","artificial immune system;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system","Artificial immune systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Detectors;Gene expression;Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Phase detection","genetic algorithms;security of data","anomaly detection;artificial immune system;computer networks;evolution induced secondary immunity;genetic algorithm;genetic operators;intrusion detection system;memory cells;natural immune systems;primary immune response;secondary immune response","","5","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection module uses PCA technique to accumulate interested statistical variables and compares them with the thresholds derived from users activities data. When the variables exceed the estimated thresholds, an alarm is raised to alert about a possible intrusion in the network.

Therefore, network traffic monitoring and analysis have become essential in order to troubleshoot and resolve problems effectively when they occur, so that network services do not stand still for long durations of time. Traffic monitoring is a technique which constantly monitors the network traffic and notifies the administrator whenever there is an outage. There are many network monitoring tools available for network administrators, which use different monitoring techniques in order to monitor and analyze network traffic.

However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later.

Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922","Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber","Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design","","","","2","","14","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulations results using a 32 nm process technology show that under the same robustness against noise, the proposed array dissipates 12% less leakage power with minimal impact on frequency of operation when compared to known design of low-power TCAM arrays.","","978-1-4244-4886-9;9781424448869","978-1-4244-4888-3;9781424448883","10.1109/ICCCAS.2009.5250516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5250516","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Circuit simulation;Computer aided manufacturing;Data compression;Ethernet networks;Field programmable gate arrays;Impedance matching;Laser sintering","content-addressable storage","16-transistor core memory cells;low-power ternary content addressable memory array;read and search operations","","3","","18","","","23-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process. We implemented e-NeXSh as a set of modifications to the Linux-2.4.18-3 kernel and a new user-space shared library (e-NeXSh.so). The technique is transparent, requiring no modifications to existing libraries or applications. e-NeXSh was able to successfully defeat both code-injection and LIBC-based attacks in our effectiveness tests.

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic. This traffic-monitoring framework helps identify network activities of stealthy malware, and lends itself to a powerful personal firewall for examining all outbound traffic of a host that cannot be bypassed.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035722","Authentication;cryptography;malware;networking.;provenance","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Malware;Network security;System-on-a-chip","cryptography;formal verification;invasive software;protocols;trusted computing","TPM;critical system information;cryptographic provenance verification;data-provenance verification;malicious software;malicious traffic detection;malware;protocol;secure hosts;system-data integrity;trusted computing platform","","5","","37","","2011-10-06","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","5","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The challenge for malicious actors is to gain initial control of the victim's machine by bypassing all the security controls. The most favored bait often used by attackers is to deceive users through a trusting or interesting email containing a malicious attachment or a malicious link. To make the email credible and interesting the cybercriminals often perform reconnaissance activities to find background information on the potential target. To this end, the value of information found on the discarded or stolen storage devices is often underestimated or ignored. In this paper, we present the partial results of analysis of one such hard disk that was purchased from the open market. The data found on the disk contained highly sensitive personal and organizational data. The results from the case study will be useful in not only understanding the involved risk but also creating awareness of related threats.","","","","10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2015.7351956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351956","Advanced Persistent Threat;Cybercrime;Data Recovery;Digital Forensics;Security and Privacy Awareness;Social Network Analysis;Spear-phishing","Electronic mail;Hard disks;Malware;Media;Organizations;Software","data protection;digital forensics;hard discs;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","background information;cybercriminals;discarded hard disks;discarded storage devices;e-mail credibility;malicious activities;malicious actors;malicious attachment;malicious link;malware;reconnaissance activities;recovered sensitive data;security controls;security threats;sensitive-personal organizational data;stolen storage devices;trust management","","","","15","","","10-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The application of a low pass filter in anomaly network intrusion detection","Jun Li; C. Manikopoulos","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","265","271","A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826","","Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement","computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering","","0","","8","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the paper proposes the Templates Finite Automata Grouping Algorithm (TFA), which divides rule sets into different groups based on templates of the rules. Each group is used to construct its corresponding matching engine. At the meantime, the number of rule subsets is altered according to the quantity of actual rules and the structure of a system to achieve better matching efficiency. Theoretical analysis and the experiments conducted indicate that comparing with the conventional grouping algorithms, the TFA requires far fewer groups at the relatively similar level of storage space compression; and comparing with other classical DFA improved algorithms, the TFA achieves shorter pretreatment time and demands smaller storage space with no noticeably decrease in the matching efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354737","deterministic finite automata;grouping algorithm;regular expression;rule templates;templates finite automata","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Engines;Explosions;Switches","deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;security of data","DFA;TFA;deterministic finite automata;intrusion detection system;regular expression matching algorithm;template finite automata grouping algorithm","","","","13","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.

A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) the structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, especially significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable. Solutions addressing these sources often both reduce the overall latency and make it more predictable.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2375213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967689","Data communication;Internet;algorithms;bufferbloat;comparative evaluation;congestion control;cross-layer;latency;networks;performance;protocols;queuing delay;standards;taxonomy","Delays;Internet;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Tutorials","","","","5","","","","2014-11-26","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First stage is the offline training process where the extracted features in the database is clustered using k-means clustering and then the second stage is the online testing where the obtained query image is compared with the clustered images and is classified as intruder or authenticated person based on the similarity measure.","","978-1-4577-0588-5;9781457705885","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972434","Block Independent Component Analysis (B-ICA);Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR);Face Recognition;K-means clustering","Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Training","content-based retrieval;face recognition;feature extraction;image retrieval;independent component analysis;pattern clustering","BICA-C;authenticated person;block independent component analysis;content based image retrieval;face detection;face recognition;image content;image database;image feature extraction;intruder;k-means clustering technique;offline training process;online testing;query image;semantically relevant image retrieval","","1","","11","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3;9781424460373","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","24","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The processing speed of one IDS cannot achieve the throughput requirement in the core networks because of the pattern matching, the key operation for signature-based IDS, is complex and time consuming. In this paper, it argues that if the signature set is shared by multiple IDSs, a packet needs to be checked once and once only by one of the IDSs, so traffic load can be redistributed among the IDSs to avoid local congestion. Packet marking is used to indicate the status of this packet utilized by collaborative IDSs, and a redistribution strategy named inner logical ring (ILR) is built among IDSs to redistribute the traffic load. Meanwhile, caching scheme is used to keep sequence for packets belonging to the same flow. This collaborative distributed IDS is robust with rapid response to various attacks, and the detection throughput is significantly increased from the throughput of the weakest IDS to the summation of all the collaborative IDSs.","2153-1447;21531447","978-0-7695-3431-2;9780769534312","","10.1109/FGCN.2008.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4734082","attack detection;collaborative detection;pattern matching;signature-based;traffic load distribution","Computer science;Computer viruses;Computer worms;IP networks;International collaboration;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;groupware;security of data","Internet users protection;caching scheme;collaborative distributed intrusion detection system;signature-based intrusion detection system;traffic load","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the paper, SIP intrusion detection and prevention requirements are analyzed and an IDS/IPS architecture is proposed. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5;1424401445","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","18","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes.
