It enables entities to cope with uncertainty and uncontrollability caused by the free will of others. Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works on trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of network dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770276","Aggregation;MANET;Propagation;Security;Trust Computations","Ad hoc networks;Measurement;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Sensors","computational complexity;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;computational complexity constraint;mobile ad hoc networks;network dynamics;security services;trust computations;trust computing;trust dynamics","","51","","144","","2011-05-19","Second Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","187","194","This paper describes the architecture and provides early test results of the reconnaissance intrusion detection system (RIDS) prototype. RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network. The attack space on a mesh network is particularly large; we motivate the need for and describe the challenges of adopting an asset-driven approach to managing this space.

Different kinds of network security policies are defined globally and distributed among multiple security middleboxes deployed in networks. However, due to the complexity of security policy, it is inefficient to directly employ existing path-wise enforcement approaches. This paper models the enforcement of network security policy as the set-covering problem, and designs a computational-geometry-based policy space analysis (PSA) tool for set operations of security policy. Leveraging the PSA, this paper first investigates the topological characteristics of different types of policies. This heuristic information reveals intrinsic complexities of security policy and guides the design of our enforcement approach. Then the paper proposes a scope-wise policy enforcement algorithm that selects a modest number of enforcement network nodes to deploy multiple policy subsets in a greedy manner. This approach can be employed on network topologies of both datacenter and service provider. The efficiencies of the PSA tool and the enforcement algorithm are also evaluated. Compared with the header space analysis, the PSA achieves much better memory and time efficiencies on set operations of security policy. Additionally, the proposed enforcement algorithm is able to guarantee network security within a reasonable number of enforcement network nodes, without introducing many extra rules.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2502402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362256","Middlebox policy enforcement;policy space analysis;software-defined network","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Middleboxes;Routing;Security","","","","","","","","2015-12-22","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It promises to virtualize entire classes of network node functions within a data-center and to deliver network services in the form of Virtualized Network Function (VNF) service chains using commercial off-the-shelf hardware and IT virtualization technologies. However, availability gets an important issue when purpose-built telecom hardware designed for the ""fives nines"" standard via built-in failure protection and recovery mechanisms is replaced by the off-the shelf hardware. With commercial off-the-shelf data-center hardware, failure probabilities could be higher than in traditional physical network infrastructure. Thus with NFV, infrastructure availability has to be considered all the way from the physical right up to the hypervisor layer and resilience mechanisms need to be built into the software and service provisioning design. In this work, we model different backup strategies for VNF service chains and provide algorithms for their resilient embedding in the data-center. Further, we answer the question which data-center topologies offer the best cost-per-throughput relation for a given resilience/availability for VNF service chains.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414158","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Europe;Hardware;Servers;Software;Topology","computer architecture;computer centres;computer network reliability;system recovery;virtualisation","IT virtualization technology;NFV;VNF service chain;commercial off-the-shelf hardware technology;data-center architecture;failure probabilities;high availability requirements;hypervisor layer mechanism;hypervisor resilience mechanism;infrastructure availability;network function virtualization;virtualized network function service chain","","","","19","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity.

This paper proposes a framework that predicts multi-stage attacks based on a different approach, which is an IP information evaluation. This approach was chosen after analysing three different multi-stage attack scenarios.

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","1095-2055;10952055","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","18","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.","","978-1-4244-4816-6;9781424448166","978-1-4244-4817-3;9781424448173","10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207","bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme","Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads","computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching","Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats","","2","3","10","","","16-18 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for such matching arises from two independent trends. First, the volume and share of compressed HTTP traffic is constantly increasing. Second, due to their superior expressibility, current Deep Packet Inspection engines use regular expressions more and more frequently. We present an algorithmic framework to accelerate such matching, taking advantage of information gathered when the traffic was initially compressed. HTTP compression is typically performed through the GZIP protocol, which uses back-references to repeated strings. Our algorithm is based on calculating (for every byte) the minimum number of (previous) bytes that can be part of a future regular expression matching. When inspecting a back-reference, only these bytes should be taken into account, thus enabling one to skip repeated strings almost entirely without missing a match. We show that our generic framework works with either NFA-based or DFA-based implementations and gains performance boosts of more than 70%. Moreover, it can be readily adapted to most existing regular expression matching algorithms, which usually are based either on NFA, DFA or combinations of the two. Finally, we discuss other applications in which calculating the number of relevant bytes becomes handy, even when the traffic is not compressed.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218421","","Acceleration;Automata;Computers;Conferences;Estimation;Inspection;Pattern matching","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;hypermedia;pattern matching;transport protocols","DFA-based implementation;GZIP protocol;NFA-based implementation;compressed HTTP traffic;deterministic finite automata;hypertext transfer protocol;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To our knowledge, PERG is the first pattern matching hardware targeting viruses, as well as the first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks.

Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path.

The method is based on Rough Set Theory to extract a set of detection rules with a minimal size as the normal behavior model from the system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It is capable of detecting the abnormal operating status of a process and thus reporting a possible intrusion. This method requires a smaller size of training data set compared with other methods, less effort to collect training data and is more suitable for real-time detection. Experimental results show that this method is promising in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency.","2158-5695;21585695","978-1-4244-2238-8;9781424422388","978-1-4244-2239-5;9781424422395","10.1109/ICWAPR.2008.4635880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4635880","Anomaly detection;Intrusion detection;Rough sets","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Set theory;Training data;Wavelet analysis","rough set theory;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection method;pattern recognition;rough set theory;system call sequences","","0","","16","","","30-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV. This mechanism is enhancement of Adaptive Acknowledgement (AACK) and TWO-ACK, here we have tried to show the efficiency increment by decreasing number of messages routed in the network.","","978-1-4799-3078-4;9781479930784","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968417","Ad-hoc network;Black Hole;MANET;Permutation;Security","Bandwidth;Decision support systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV;MANET;TWO-ACK;adaptive acknowledgement;black hole attack detection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc network;permutation based acknowledgement;reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;wireless links","","0","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1;9781457711251","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA.

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers. In addition, based on real data run in POWER WORLD for IEEE benchmark power systems, and through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that BLITHE outperforms the state of arts for detecting abnormal behaviors in pervasive smart grid applications.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2459049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163500","Insider threat detection;security;smart grid","Cryptography;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Power measurement;Smart grids;State estimation","IEEE standards;load flow;power system security;power system state estimation;smart power grids;statistical analysis","BLITHE;DC power flow model;IEEE benchmark power system;POWER WORLD;abnormal behavior detection;behavior rule-based insider threat detection;behavior specification;compliance-distance-based grading strategy;data monitor device;rule-weight grading strategy;smart grid;state estimation model;statistical property","","0","","48","","2015-07-21","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, they introduce new risks by allowing attacks on shared resources such as the file system, network and kernel. Existing security hardening mechanisms protect specific applications and are not designed to protect entire environments as those inside the containers. To address these, we present a LiCShield framework for securing of linux containers and their workloads via automatic construction of rules describing the expected activities of containers spawned from a given image. Specifically, given an image of interest LiCShield traces its execution and generates profiles of kernel security modules restricting the containers' capabilities. We distinguish between the operations on the linux host and the ones inside the container to provide the following protection mechanisms: (1) Increased host protection, by restricting the operations done by containers and container management daemon only to those observed in a testing environment; (2) Narrow container operations, by tightening the internal dynamic and noisy environments, without paying the high performance overhead of their on-line monitoring. Our experimental results show that this approach is efficient to prevent known attacks, while having almost no overhead on the production environment. We present our methodology and its technological insights and provide recommendations regarding its efficient deployment with intrusion detection tools to achieve both optimized performance and increased protection.

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism not only increases the overall lifetime of a network, but also decreases the amount of imposed communication overhead on the network in comparison with the traditional leader selection algorithms.","2156-9711;21569711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686474","Bargaining game;Incentive mechanism;Leader selection;MANETs;Price-based systems;Self-organizing networks","Ad hoc networks;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Lead;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Protocols","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks","MANETs;bargaining games;battery depletion;communication overhead;incentive-based leader selection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc networks;selfish nodes","","0","","14","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Pattern matching is a major task in deep packet inspection. The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

Second, a lack of comprehensive labeled Synchrophasor data along with other system related information imposes challenges to the development and evaluation of data mining algorithms that can classify power system cyberpower events. In this work, a WAMS cyber-physical test bed was developed using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Commercial control and monitoring devices, hardware, software, and industry standard communication networks and protocols were combined with custom Matlab, Python, and AutoIt scripts to model realistic power system contingencies and cyber-attacks. An automated simulation and control engine was developed to randomize modeled cyber-power events including power system faults, contingencies, control actions and cyber-attacks. Scripts were added to capture heterogenous sensor data and create ground truth labeled datasets. The WAMS cyber-physical test bed is capable of simulating various sized power systems and creating datasets without altering the hardware configuration. A WAMS architecture is presented to document the integration of various components.

For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial. Survivability is defined as the ability of a system to continuously provide essential services to support the system's mission even in the presence of malicious attacks or system failures.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes.

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection.

Trust management schemes have been researched and implemented in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to provide an added advantage over and above the cryptographic security mechanisms. Each trust management scheme deals with the concept of trust and its evaluation in a unique manner. This uniqueness in approach is achieved by using network parameters, QoS, behavior of nodes etc. as metrics to evaluate trust. Every trust management scheme aims at providing resilience to the effect of malicious or selfish nodes. In this paper, we propose a node memory based trust evaluation method by using memory integrity as a metric to evaluate trust. The results indicate the method to be promising to evaluate trust at node-level and network-level.","","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507450","Network-Level Security;Node-Level Security;Sensor Verification;Software;Trust Evaluation","Cloning;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Measurement;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MITE;QoS;WSN;cryptographic security mechanisms;malicious nodes;memory integrity;memory integrity based trust evaluation;network parameters;node memory based trust evaluation;security;selfish nodes;trust management schemes;wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to deal with this problem is to filter unwanted traffic at the routers based on source IP addresses. Because of the limited number of available filters in the routers today, aggregation is used in practice: a single filter describes and blocks an entire range of IP addresses. This results in blocking of all (unwanted and wanted) traffic generated from hosts with IP addresses in that range. In this paper, we develop a family of algorithms that, given a blacklist containing the source IP addresses of unwanted traffic and a constraint on the number of filters, construct a set of filtering rules that optimize the tradeoff between the unwanted and legitimate traffic that is blocked. We show that our algorithms are optimal and also computationally efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that they are particularly beneficial when applied to realistic distributions of sources of unwanted traffic, which are known to exhibit spatial and temporal clustering.","","978-1-4244-2670-6;9781424426706","","10.1109/ITA.2008.4601049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601049","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Constraint optimization;Filtering algorithms;Floods;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Jacobian matrices;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;filtering theory;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","Internet;distributed denial-of-service attacks;filtering sources;realistic distributions;routers based on source IP addresses;temporal clustering;unwanted traffic","","3","","11","","","Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But, like most things in life, the benefits come with risks. It's just a matter of knowing if the benefits outweigh the risks and vice versa. Unfortunately, the cloud computing does not escape to this universal rule. Then, it is important to consider the security of the cloud. As a solution to protect the cloud from security issues [1, 2, 3, 4], we think that IDSs integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution. We will also present an architecture based IDS that respects multi-tenancy architecture. The objective behind integrating multi-tenancy aspect in our solution is to give tenants the ability to configure some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code. This means that although tenants an using the same building blocks in their configuration, the appearance or workflow of the application may be different for two tenants. Also, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of each tenant can differ. In fact, we contend that multi-tenancy is a requirement for any cloud architecture because of four key benefits. First, High security: there are 3 key components that define the degree of isolation between multiple tenants in a data center: access policies, application deployment and data access and protection. Second, Economy: software development and maintenance costs are shared between the tenants. Third, Service assurance and faster updates: with multi-tenancy, the provider has to make updates once. In contrast with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to application code. Fourth, Efficiency and flexibility: A SaaS provider can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multipl- customers. Each tenant's data is Isolated and remains invisible to other tenants [11].","","978-1-4799-0322-1;9781479903221","","10.1109/JNS3.2013.6595469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595469","cloud computing;cloud security;computer attacks;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;multi-tenancy;network attacks","Architecture;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Reliability;Security","cloud computing;security of data;software engineering","SaaS provider;access policies;application deployment;cloud computing architectures based multitenant IDS;data access;data center;data protection;maintenance costs;multitenancy aspect;security issues;service assurance;service level agreement;software development","","0","","17","","","26-27 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A suggestion block provides hints for threat assessment based on a set of rules. The core threat detection block estimates probabilities of the suggested threats using Multi-Entities Bayesian Networks (MEBN) logic inference based on facts resulting from observed events and knowledge stored in an environment specific threat detection ontology (TDO).

Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-1456-7;9781424414567","978-1-4244-1457-4;9781424414574","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not feasible in the limited resources available in SoC systems. We propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique along with Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design to solve uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information. Also, the k-NN technique is applied to speed up the detection process. We compare the results of our proposed approach with those of k-NN classifier, fuzzy k-NN classifier and evidence-theoretic k-NN classifier.
