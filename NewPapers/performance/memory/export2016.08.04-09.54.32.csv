Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2848-1;0769528481","","10.1109/SP.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes","data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels","attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats","","16","","18","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While intrusion event correlation and attack scenario construction have been previously studied, this is the first treatment based on association with network attack graphs. We handle missed detections through the analysis of network vulnerability dependencies, unlike previous approaches that infer hypothetical attacks. In particular, we quantify lack of knowledge through attack graph distance. We show that low-pass signal filtering of event correlation sequences improves results in the face of erroneous detections. We also show how a correlation threshold can be applied for creating strongly correlated attack scenarios. Our model is highly efficient, with attack graphs and their exploit distances being computed offline. Online event processing requires only a database lookup and a small number of arithmetic operations, making the approach feasible for real-time applications.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377242","","Aggregates;Arithmetic;Context modeling;Databases;Event detection;Face detection;Filtering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters","computer network management;correlation theory;low-pass filters;security of data","arithmetic operation;attack scenario construction;intrusion event correlation;low-pass signal filtering;network attack graph;online event processing","","30","2","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in identifying a wide range of anomalies.

The IDS to accomplish its function must, in some way, to guarantee reliability and availability to its own application, so that it gets to give continuity to the services even in case of faults, mainly faults caused by malicious agents. This paper proposes an adaptive fault tolerance mechanism for network intrusion detection system based on intelligent agents. We propose the creation of a society of agents that monitors a system to collect information related to agents and hosts. Using the information which is collected, it is possible: to detect which agents are still active; which agents should be replicated and which strategy should be used. The process of replication depends on each type of agent, and its importance to the system at different moments of processing. We use some agents as sentinels for monitoring and thus allowing us to accomplish some important tasks such load balancing, migration, and detection of malicious agents, to guarantee the security of the proper IDS","","0-7695-2560-1;0769525601","","10.1109/SEUS-WCCIA.2006.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611713","","Availability;Face detection;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Information security;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Load management;Monitoring;Protection","computer networks;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;security of data","authorization;fault tolerance;information retrieval;intelligent agents;network intrusion detection system;security","","3","","16","","","27-28 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET.

In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph. We then analyze graphs similarity to determine whether such high-level behavioral profile is sufficient to provide accurate classification of malware samples.

In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics.

In a virtual machine (VMs) based computing system, a virtual machine monitor (VMM) allows applications to run in different VMs strongly isolated from each other. A trusted VMM (TVMM) based platform can provide stronger security protection for group signature systems than traditional computing platforms can. The authors first introduce a TVMM-based group signature architecture and a TVMM security protection mechanism for group signature components.

This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

The characteristics of VANETs are: an open medium, no traditional security infrastructure, high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, we build an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) for VANETs that uses a Proportional Overlapping Scores (POS) method to reduce the number of features that are extracted from the trace file of VANET behavior and used for classification. These are relevant features that describe the normal or abnormal behavior of vehicles. The IDS uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and fuzzified data to detect black hole attacks. The IDSs use the features extracted from the trace file as auditable data to detect the attack.

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, it presents a scalable protocol that combines a reputation system with AODV that addresses reputation fading, second-chance, robustness against liars and load balancing.","","0-7803-9549-2;0780395492","","10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1666450","AODV;Reliability;Reputation System","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Reliability engineering;Robustness;Routing protocols;Scalability;Semiconductor device reliability","","AODV;Reliability;Reputation System","","5","","42","","","03-06 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless sensor networks must be secured from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and from forging sensor data. The security and privacy problem related to wireless sensor networkpsilas application has become a serious issue in the real service environment. In this paper, we propose our management platform and security framework for wireless sensor networks. The proposed framework has advantages as regards secure association and intrusion detection.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm. We finally present extensive simulation results of network-based virus/worm detection using real signature databases to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","1092-1648;10921648","1-4244-0593-9;1424405939","1-4244-0594-7;1424405947","10.1109/ICNP.2006.320212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4110291","","Computer networks;Data security;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer viruses;database management systems;digital signatures;optimisation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Internet;TCAM-based hardware;multi-gigabit rate search speed;multiple string matching algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;network-based virus/worm detection;optimization;pattern matching;security attack;signature database;string matching","","36","46","35","","","12-15 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","13","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method. The proposed method is memorybased, so it is quickly reconfigurable and dissipates lower power than a TCAM-based method.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole. Then the performance of these attacks against the proposed algorithm has been calculated and result is displayed.","","978-0-9893-1933-1;9780989319331","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918258","Adhoc networks;Denial of service;Intrusion;Multitier;Trust;commitment","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","DSR algorithm;application layer data;application tier;data transfer;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;muiltier intrusion detection system;routing policy;routing tier;security attack;trust tier;trusted connection;trusted multitier method","","0","","15","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA.

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying ""blindspots"" in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attackspsila features for improving the preventive algorithms. The traditional intrusion detection algorithms canpsilat be applied directly to WSNs due to their constraints of resources.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets. Post-place-and-route results show that when 8 characters are matched per cycle, our design can achieve 180 MHz clock rate, leading to a throughput of 11.8 Gbps.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4577-0831-2;9781457708312","978-1-4577-0832-9;9781457708329","10.1109/HPSR.2012.6260830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6260830","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;context;off-chip memory;packet flow","Context;Pipelines;Random access memory;Switches;Switching circuits;System-on-a-chip;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;logic design","REM;deep packet inspection;frequency 180 MHz;hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism;large-capacity memory;large-scale multiflow regular expression matching;large-size packet;off-chip memory;packet flow;packet processing operation;post-place-and-route;state-of-the-art FPGA device","","2","","13","","","24-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path.

For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications.

In recent years we have experienced a wave of DDoS attacks threatening the welfare of the Internet. These are launched by malicious users whose pure incentive is to degrade the performance of other, innocent, users. The traditional systems turn out to be quite vulnerable to these attacks. The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then evaluate the commonly used data structure in network mechanisms, the hash data structure, using our vulnerability metric. We show that a Closed Hash is much more vulnerable than an Open Hash to DDoS attacks, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent via traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queueing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Lastly we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509893","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Degradation;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web server","Internet;data structures;queueing theory;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;distributed denial of service;hash data structure;queueing mechanism","","6","","15","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-147X;1946147X","978-1-4244-7842-2;9781424478422","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","6","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is useful for adapting security policy, analysis of vulnerabilities, and creation of reports that effectively communicate security vulnerability discoveries and detailed corrective actions to all levels of an organization. While vulnerability assessment is not a new technology, mobile agents offer many advantages to the traditional implementations. The most significant contribution is the increased ability for system administrators to quickly and easily add distributed components to existing systems that can look for newly published vulnerabilities. This paper suggests the vulnerability assessment through mobile agents where both network and host-based technologies in coordinated fashion using mobile agents will provide the best vulnerability assessment for measuring an organization's security risks. The mobile agent targets the intended host or network, captures, analyzes, and scans all vulnerabilities and reports to the master agent/server for comprehensive analysis and security assessment, and the master agent will act accordingly.

The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system.

Threat detection systems should be more intelligent because threats are becoming more dangerous. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a potential network security solution for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and information resources. A fast and effective IDS for mobile networks that does not violate the user's privacy or the network's QoS is required. This paper offers a set of flow-based features that can be utilized for mobile network traffic as a prerequisite for a privacy-aware and QoS-robust IDS. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used for reduction of the features. Twelve features in six groups, which represent the user data in mobile traffic, were extracted and evaluated for IDSs. The evaluation process achieved a F-measure weighted average equal to 0.834, and the experimental time was equal to 12.9 seconds. The accomplished measurements have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed set of features.","","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500483","Internet of Things (IoT) security;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs);feature extraction;mobile traffic","Feature extraction;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunications","mobile communication;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PCA;QoS;flow-based features;intrusion detection system;mobile network traffic;mobile networks;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile traffic;network security;principal component analysis;security risks;threat detection systems;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, grid computing stills a new paradigm that raises many security issues and conflicts in the computing infrastructures where it is integrated. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the autonomy, intelligence and independence of mobile agents to record the behaviors and actions on the grid resource nodes to detect malicious intruders. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic traces associated with chaining mechanism to elaborate hashed black statements of the executed agent code, which are then compared to depict intrusions.

Regular expressions are one method to implement such matching and are often built in FPGAs using non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). To obtain high throughputs it is necessary to process many bytes in parallel. This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA. Throughputs over 40Gbps are achieved on smaller rule-sets.

We present a design and proof-of-concept implementation of a packet processing system that uses two security techniques to defend against potential attacks: a processing monitor is used to track operations on each processor core to detect attacks at the processing instruction level; an I/O monitor is used to track operations of the router to detect attacks at the protocol level.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
