In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1;0780381041","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6;9781424475476","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4799-5062-1;9781479950621","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492","","Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads","","","","2","","19","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions. This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context. The key dimensions are energy budget, computing power and memory size of nodes, location-based security threat levels, data coherence, and data lifetime.

As IDS traces monitor large groups of servers, large amounts of network data and also spanning a variety of patterns, efficient analytical approaches are needed to address this big heterogeneous data analysis problem. We believe that using unsupervised learning methods can help to classify data that allows analysts to find out meaningful insights and extract the value of the collected data more precisely and efficiently. This study demonstrates how the technique of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) can be utilized to facilitate efficient event data analysis. For the collected IDS traces, GHSOM is used to cluster data and reveal the geometric distances between each cluster in a topological space such that the attack signatures for each cluster can be easily identified. The experimental results from a real-world IDS traces show that our proposed approach can efficiently discover several critical attack patterns and significantly reduce the size of IDS trace log which needs to be further analyzed. The proposed approach can help internet security administrators/analysts to conduct network forensics analysis, discover suspicious attack sources, and set up recovery processes to prevent previously unknown security threats such as zero-day attacks.","","","","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034762","cloud services;forensic analysis;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;internet security;intrusion detection system","Correlation;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;data analysis;digital signatures;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;IDS traces;Internet security administrators;Internet security analysts;analytical approach;attack signatures;cloud services;cluster geometric distances;complex data pattern parsing;critical attack patterns;data classification;data clustering;event data analysis;event pattern discovery;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;heterogeneous data analysis problem;intrusion detection rule sets;intrusion detection system;network forensics analysis;recovery process;suspicious attack source discovery;topological space;unsupervised learning methods","","0","","22","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper analyses the requirements of ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems and presents our approach for an IPS that runs on top of an active networking environment and is automatically configured by a vulnerability scanner. We call the system FIDRAN (Flexible Intrusion Detection and Response framework for Active Networks). The system autonomously analyses the home network and correspondingly configures the IPS. Furthermore, our system detects and adjusts itself to changes in the home network (new service, new host, etc.).

This is because existing guidelines, IT standards and laws on security and privacy do not take virtual environments into account. Thus, they present a significant challenge for cloud providers to comply with. As a result, the cloud providers are unable to provide SMEs with an assurance. In order to address these privacy and security issues, this paper presents the Cloud Data Security (CloudDataSec) project that aims to design cloud services adhering to government privacy laws. In particular, this paper introduces a six-layer security model for cloud computing and three level of security assurance for SMEs to take advantage of.

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

Paxson","TU Munchen, Garching, Germany","21st Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'05)","20060103","2005","","","13 pp.","71","Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) critically rely on processing a great deal of state. Often much of this state resides solely in the volatile processor memory accessible to a single user-level process on a single machine. In this work, we highlight the power of independent state, i.e., internal fine-grained state that can be propagated from one instance of a NIDS to others running either concurrently or subsequently. Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs.

Although Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have appealing features (e.g., low installation cost, unattended network operation), due to the lack of a physical line of defense (i.e., there are no gateways or switches to monitor the information flow), the security of such networks is a big concern, especially for the applications where confidentiality has prime importance. Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station). In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided. Secondly, a brief survey of IDSs proposed for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is presented and applicability of those systems to WSNs are discussed. Thirdly, IDSs proposed for WSNs are presented.

Since many current Intrusion Detection Systems are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to them are expensive and slow. In data mining-based intrusion detection system, we should make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion detection in order to efficiently extract relative rules from large amounts of records.

In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, and exploit this questionable assumption to subvert VM introspection. In particular, we present an attack called DKSM (Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation), and show that it can effectively foil existing VM introspection solutions into providing false information.

In spite of its huge success, most ensemble methods tend to generate unnecessary large number of classifiers, which entails an increase in memory storage, computational cost, and even a reduction of the generalization performance of the ensemble. Ensemble selection addresses these shortcomings by searching for a fraction of individual classifiers that performs as good as, or better than the entire ensemble. In this paper, we formulate the problem of ensemble selection as a coalitional game in a graph form, and name the approach ISCG-Ranking. The proposed game aims at capturing two crucial concepts that affect the performance of an ensemble: accuracy and diversity. Most importantly, it ranks every classifier based on its contribution in keeping a proper balance between these two notions using Shapley value. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art techniques on 26 UCI benchmark datasets. The results reveal that ISCG-Ranking significantly improves the original ensemble and performs better than other methods in most cases.","1082-3409;10823409","","","10.1109/ICTAI.2015.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372193","Coalitional Games;Core;Ensemble Pruning;Ensemble Selection;Ensemble of Classifiers;Game Theory;Induced Subgraph Games;Shapley Value","Computational efficiency;Game theory;Games;Information theory;Random variables;Resource management;Training","game theory;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CGT;ISCG-Ranking;Shapley value;UCI benchmark datasets;classifier;coalitional game theory;ensemble learning;ensemble selection;graph form;induced subgraph coalitional game","","","","44","","","9-11 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FPT 2009. International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8;9781424443758","978-1-4244-4377-2;9781424443772","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","5","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mimicry traffic is potentially neglected by detectors. In this paper, we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based method for detecting anomalous traffic mimicking legitimate traffic. Our method firstly observes the port pair distribution of traffic flows, which is a novel statistical traffic feature proposed in this work. Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold. We tested the performance of our method with traffic which was mixed by four synthetic mimicry anomalies and real-world backbone traffic. The results indicated that our method could precisely detect all synthetic anomalies. Furthermore, our method additionally revealed six real-world anomalies that were hidden in the testing backbone traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238570","Kullback-Leibler divergence;Statistical anomaly detection;distance measure;mimicry anomaly;statistical traffic feature","Ash;Computer crime;Detectors;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Ports (Computers)","security of data;telecommunication traffic","HTTP;KL divergence-based method;Kullback-Leibler divergence;anomalous traffic;legitimate traffic;network-based mimicry anomaly detection;port pair distribution;real-world backbone traffic;statistical traffic feature;synthetic mimicry anomalies;time intervals","","0","","20","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","40","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454","Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines","VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines","","0","","26","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even on a small network, manual analysis of network traffic is inefficient and extremely time consuming. Current machine processing techniques, while fast, suffer from an unacceptable percentage of false positives and false negatives. To complement both manual and automated analysis of network traffic, we applied information visualization techniques to appropriately and effectively bring the human into the analytic loop. This paper describes the implementation and lessons learned from the creation of a novel network traffic visualization system capable of both realtime and forensic data analysis. Combining the strength of link analysis using parallel coordinate plots with the time-sequence animation of scatter plots, we examine a 2D and 3D coordinated display that provides insight into both legitimate and malicious network activity.

To establish what constitutes abuse in an IaaS environment, a survey of acceptable use policies of cloud service providers was conducted. We have found that existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques are only of limited use in this environment due to the high level of control that users can exercise over their resources. However, cloud computing opens up different opportunities for intrusion detection.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822;21556822","978-1-4577-0753-7;9781457707537","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","2","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates how informed decisions can be made on a real-world scenario of attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007770","Game theory;SCADA;SCADA security;Sequential games;payoffs;utility function","Conferences;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Smart grids","SCADA systems;decision theory;fault diagnosis;game theory;power system faults;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","behavioral modeling;cyber attack game analysis;decision analysis;fault detection;fault recovery;game payoffs development;informed decision derivation;intrusion detection;model extensibility;nonzero sum game model;post-attack response;security management;sequential game model;smart grid SCADA system security;smart grid protection;supervisory control-and-data acquisition;two-player game model","","0","","15","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt. For heap overflow vulnerability, we can automatically exploit the unlink() macro of glibc, which formerly requires sophisticated hacking efforts.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717039","Automatic exploit generation;bug forensics;software crash analysis;symbolic execution;taint analysis","Analytical models;Computer crashes;Concrete;Libraries;Registers;Security;Software","computer crime;program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;symbol manipulation","Microsoft office word;S<sup>2</sup>E;archiver;attack generation;automatic exploit generation;binary programs;concolic executions;end-to-end approach;format string;foxit;heap overflows;mapped symbolic memory;media player;mitigation-hardened exploits;mpalyer;pdf reader;pseudo symbolic variables;software crash analysis;software failures;software fuzz testing targets;sophisticated hacking efforts;stack overflows;symbolic failure model;symbolic pointers;unrar;word processor","","1","","30","","2014-01-20","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to expand the markets and maximize profits, IPTV providers need to create more appealing programs and better broadcasting schedules by understanding the usage patterns and user behaviours. They can gather log data from the set-top box (STB) and network devices. However, due to huge amounts of log files in large-scale IPTV system, it is not easy to perform deep analysis for various metrics on time. The volume of log data is expected to increase rapidly because of the explosive growth of users. For the efficient management of analysis jobs for diverse metrics under a large set of log data, in this paper, we propose MapReduce-based IPTV log analysis methods on the cloud computing platform, called Hadoop. We carried out experiments with a small testbed and a large one with Amazon service, and found that the MapReduce-based approach outperforms the DBMS by 13 times. From the MapReduce analysis, we also present the characteristics of hourly usage pattern, channel variation, and regional features of IPTV users.","1738-9445;17389445","978-1-4673-0150-3;9781467301503","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174878","Hadoop;IPTV;MapReduce;cloud computing;log;user behavior","Cloud computing;Hard disks;IPTV;Loading;Performance evaluation;Servers","IPTV;Internet;broadcasting;database management systems;user interfaces","DBMS;Hadoop;IPTV system;ISP;MapReduce;broadcasting schedules;content provider;program provider;user behaviors","","0","","9","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During node mobility, there are possibilities for the malicious node to become the cluster head or cluster member. This causes the cluster or the whole network to be controlled by the malicious nodes. To offer high level of security, the mobile sensor nodes need to be authenticated. Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes. In addition, a bidirectional malicious node detection technique is employed which eliminates the malicious node from the network. By simulation, it is proved that the proposed technique provides efficient security with reduced energy consumption during node mobility.","1673-5447;16735447","","","10.1109/CC.2016.7513213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513213","cluster;dynamic key;heterogeneous;mobility;weight;wireless sensor network","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Heuristic algorithms;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","authenticated nodes;average distance;average speed;bidirectional malicious node detection technique;cluster based secure dynamic keying technique;cluster head;cluster member;data delivery;energy efficient routing;heterogeneous mobile wireless sensor networks;node degree;node mobility;sensor nodes;virtual battery power;weight value","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers.","2165-8765;21658765","","","10.1109/PacificVis.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787176","Network Anomaly Visualization","Data visualization;Image color analysis;Joining processes;Market research;Security;Servers;Visualization","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation","IDS log;Web-based open platform;anomaly detection;collaborative analysis;faulty devices;interactive visualization;intrusion detection system log;large-scale networks;log data analysis;malicious applications;malicious users;minimum learning curve;multiple commodity visualizations;network anomaly analysis tool;network management;suspicious behavior detection;suspicious pattern detection","","2","","14","","","4-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20021107","2002","3","","1530","1539","We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","87","8","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless technologies including 802.15.4, 802.11, and the Zigbee protocol. Each of these will expose the power grid to cyber security threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Smart Grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the Analyzing Module (AM) in the multiple layers of smart grids.

Mobile Networks have been implemented in order to serve these needs. Unfortunately there are many users who want to use the benefits that technology gives to them for malicious and/or illegal actions. In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cyber crime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e.g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users. Our goal is to demonstrate their applicability to cyber-crime forensics and their capability to operate in a complementary, to each other, way so that their deployment sheds light to different aspects of the case at hand.","","978-1-4673-2497-7;9781467324977","","10.1109/ASONAM.2012.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425641","anti-forensics;computer forensics tools;malicious activities;malware attacks on mobile phones","Computers;Educational institutions;Encryption;Forensics;Malware;Mobile handsets","Internet;computer crime;cryptography;digital forensics;educational institutions;mobile computing;mobile radio;public domain software;smart phones;telecommunication security","antiforensics technique;cyber-crime forensics;data encryption;illegal action;malicious action;malicious user;mobile network;mobile phone user malicious activities;open source forensics analysis tool;open source tool;pornographic content;smart mobile phone;university network facility;wireless internet access","","1","","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the inherent security weaknesses of the WS platform have lead to these WS-based applications being vulnerable and targets for attacks. This paper identifies and describes the various vulnerabilities and security threats pertaining to WS. After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced. Through illustration by examples, the framework demonstrated that by making use of agents that act as sensors, data mining techniques such as clustering, association and sequential rule coupled with fuzzy logic to further analyze and identify anomalies, is able to exhibit the adaptive nature of capturing anomalies and avoiding false alarms.","","0-7695-3038-9;0769530389","","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420313","","Computer crime;Electronic mail;Fuzzy logic;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Simple object access protocol;Web services;XML","Web services;security of data","Web service platform;Web service security;Web technology;adaptive intrusion detection;adaptive intrusion prevention","","8","","29","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeyfiles can increase a network's internal security without adversely affecting normal operations. The honeyfile system was tested by deploying it on a honeynet, where hackers' use of honeyfiles was observed. The use of honeynets to test a computer security device is also discussed.

This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm. By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic. As far as we know, we are the first paper that analyzes the problem of “on-the-fly” multipattern matching on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2172456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062397","Compressed HTTP;computer security;intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Browsers;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;data compression;hypermedia;string matching;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH;Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP;GZIP compression;compressed HTTP traffic;data compression;decompression phase;market-share;multipattern matching acceleration;pattern matching;real Web application firewall signatures;security tools;signature-based detection;string matching","","4","","34","","2011-10-27","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) P<sub>X</sub> based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences. The obtained results are compared with a version of the game in which the pmf P<sub>X</sub> is perfectly known to both the analyst and the adversary.","0018-9448;00189448","","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2325571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824190","Hypothesis testing;adversarial signal processing;counter-forensics;cybersecurity;game theory;multimedia forensics;source identification","Forensics;Games;Multimedia communication;Nash equilibrium;Testing;Training","game theory;statistical testing","binary hypothesis testing game;decision error;first order statistics;game asymptotic equilibrium;game-theoretic framework;null hypothesis;probability mass function;test sequence","","3","","37","","2014-06-02","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some studies find that in real SMT processor like Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threadings, the sharing resources (like cache) contention between threads can hurt the processing performance of network applications like servers or IDS. How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase. We also suggest a FSM decomposition based parallel processing approach to use sharing cache of SMT processors effectively.","1097-2641;10972641","1-4244-1137-8;1424411378","1-4244-1138-6;1424411386","10.1109/PCCC.2007.358913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197949","Cache;FSM decomposition;Protocol processing;SMT","Application software;Automata;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protocols;Surface-mount technology;Yarn","finite state machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FSM decomposition;Intel Xeon processor;SMT processor;TCP automata phases;cache contention;high speed network security;hyper-threading;protocol processing","","0","","30","","","11-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improves network visibility and control thereby reducing vendor dependency. OpenFlow protocol provides a standardized approach to realize these goals of SDN. In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","3","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The processes and systems for business services in cable have traditionally been vertically integrated with specific technologies. Security concerns for network operators include all the same concerns for enterprise networks and many additional challenges. The approach used to provide security for business customers, which differs from residential, is the segregation of business services, even Internet access, into separate IP address ranges and classes of services. Provisioning is the process of making provisions with network and system resources required to provide a service. Perhaps the greatest challenge for OAMPT is not the ongoing addition of new technologies to operate and support, but to maintain backward compatibility with often aging technologies. Service orders are an important concept for service providers.","","9781119000334","","10.1002/9781119000334.ch5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7046687.pdf&bkn=7043962&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2015","","","","Wiley-IEEE Press","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

The IDS was developed with the aim of detecting abnormal functioning of information systems and networks, indicating that actions not corresponding to the safety policy are led by one or several users. Centralized IDS suffer from significant limitations when used in high speed networks, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper we propose a distributed hybrid approach based on mobile agents for the detection of intrusion: HAMA-IDS (Hybrid Approach based on Mobile Agents for Intrusion Detection System). The proposed approach uses the platform Aglets for the creation and the distribution of four types of mobile agents. The Collector agent is used to the gathering of information, when the Analyzer and Redirector agent are responsible of the analysis (scenarios and behavioral analysis).
