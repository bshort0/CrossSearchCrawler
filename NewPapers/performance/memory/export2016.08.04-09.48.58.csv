The key of this approach is to model the components of the system as autonomous agents and to simulate their behavior for evaluating the system as a whole. That is very useful for observing the emergence of properties in social, biological, environmental or financial systems, among others. Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system. If agent-based modeling and simulation is used as a laboratory for understanding the biological immune system then, it can also be used for transferring the observed principles into artificial immune system models or for evaluating models that have been already adapted for solving technical problems. This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems. Then, it presents a brief explanation of the behavior of the cells of the biological immune system, which are treated as internal agents inside a biological organism. Afterwards, the modeling of some selected type of cells and the simulation of the whole simplified system are presented. In the end, the principles of that simplified system are transferred into the design of an alarm management system for the smart grid.","","978-1-4673-0900-4;9781467309004","","10.1109/ISORCW.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196124","agent-based modeling;agent-based modeling and simulation;agent-based simulation;artificial immune systems;emergence;intelligent agents;security;smart grid","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Immune system;Object oriented modeling;Pathogens","artificial immune systems;cellular biophysics;multi-agent systems","agent-based modeling;agent-based simulation;alarm management system design;artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;autonomous agents;biological immune system models;biological organism;cell behavior simulation;population-based systems;smart grid","","3","","9","","","11-11 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681;15228681","978-1-4673-5956-6;9781467359566","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","4","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees.

Serving degraded content reduces strain on resources and enables them to cater for a larger set of clients. To that end, this paper studies adversarial exploits of dynamic content adaptation mechanisms to a new instantiation of reduction of quality (RoQ) attacks. The RoQ attack pattern is orchestrated to cause different forms of damage such as longer response time for legitimate clients, degraded content being served and underutilization of resources. We assess the impact of RoQ attacks via the potency metric which reflects the tradeoffs between the damage inflicted and the cost in mounting the attack.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model.

In this paper, we propose one practical algorithm, LargePEX, for large scale approximate multiple string matching based on edit distance. The algorithm is basically extended from PEX, an algorithm of approximate single string matching, with the idea of filtering and verification. LargePEX is finely designed to fit for large-scale matching using fine grain steps analyses. Some experiments are presented to verify the efficiency of LargePEX. As the results show, for the set of 10k strings, the average network payload checking speed using this algorithm can achieve 25 MBps-40 MBps, enough for 100 Mbps Ethernet. With hardware upgrading, the algorithm is also practical for Gigabit Ethernet. So LargePEX provides a new way for defenders to develop more effective methods to protect valuable resources and prevent intrusions by payload checking.","","1-4244-0462-2;1424404622","1-4244-0463-0;1424404630","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149803","","Computer security;Ethernet networks;Filtering algorithms;Information security;Large-scale systems;National security;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection;Sequences","local area networks;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","Ethernet;LargePEX;edit distance;filtering;fine grain steps analyses;hardware upgrading;intrusion prevention;large-scale approximate multiple string matching;network security;payload checking;valuable resource protection;verification","","0","","11","","","25-27 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the Internet becomes more open to public, most people and organizations prefer to use online services. At the same time, the Internet security problem is becoming more severe. An effective and feasible protection measure for network security is necessary. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a typical measure used to provide protection for information systems. In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed. In order to analyze and evaluate the performance of this approach, comparative experiments are implemented with training and testing data from “Knowledge Discovery and Data mining cup 1999” (KDD99) dataset. The results show that our approach provides better performance than ordinary anomaly detection approaches with higher true positive rate and lower false positive rate.","","978-1-4673-1696-5;9781467316965","978-1-4673-1695-8;9781467316958","10.1109/ICCPS.2012.6384293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384293","anomaly detection;biological immunity;intrusion detection;memory cell;memory detector","Computers;Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security","IDS;Internet security problem;anomaly detection technique;biological memory cell;generation method;information system protection;intrusion detection system;memory detector;network security;online services;performance evaluation;protection measure","","0","","10","","","19-21 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-7837-8;9781424478378","978-0-7695-4158-7;9780769541587","10.1109/CICSyN.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615975","Cluster;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless ad hoc networks","","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;pattern clustering;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized monitoring points;cluster heads;clustered wireless ad hoc networks;co-operative algorithms;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;intermittent wireless communications;intrusion related message communication;mobile agents;network security;node clustering","","3","","15","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented. NS-3 simulation platform has been used to carry out performance analysis of these hierarchical routing protocols. The performance analysis shows that the hierarchical routing protocols, TL-LEACH, 3L-LEACH and 4L-LEACH fare better than the LEACH protocol.","","978-1-4799-2571-1;9781479925711","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779352","LEACH;WSN;energy efficiency;network lifetime","Monitoring;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","NS-3;WSN;clock speed;computational power;energy efficiency;finite battery energy;load balancing;multilevel LEACH protocol model;network lifetime;routing protocol;sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","6","","17","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To rapidly and efficiently analyze these logs makes great sense in terms of security and reliability. However, it is a challenging task due to the fact that a huge amount of data might be generated for being analyzed in very short time. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying complex analytics and modern in-memory database technology on the large amount of log data. Logs from different kinds of devices are collected, normalized, and stored in the In-Memory database. Machine learning approaches are then implemented to analyze the centralized big data to identify attacks and anomalies which are not easy to be detected from the individual log event. The proposed method is implemented on the In-Memory platform, i.e., SAP HANA Platform, and the experimental results show that it has the expected capabilities as well as the high performance.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336358","Active Directory;Brute Force;K-Means;Machine Learning;SIEM","Data mining;Databases;Libraries;Real-time systems;Security;Servers;Testing","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);storage management","boundary device logs;centralized Big Data;complex analytics;in-memory database technology;machine learning approaches","","","","9","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an approach relying on replication techniques and based on monitoring information to be applied in distributed systems for fault tolerance. Our approach uses both active and passive strategies to implement an optimistic replication protocol. Using a proxy to handle service calls and relying on service replication strategies, we effectively deal with the complexity and overhead issues. This paper presents an architecture for implementing the proxy based on monitoring data and the replication management. Experimentation and application testing using an implementation of the architecture is presented.

This research explores the modification of the smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. Using the results from a previous study of optimized static polling rates to create minimum and maximum thresholds, a dynamic polling rate algorithm was devised. This algorithm allowed the smart battery to gauge the network's illicit attack density and adjust its polling rate to efficiently detect attacks, while conserving battery charge life.

Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis.

These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7;9781467306737","978-1-4673-0672-0;9781467306720","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains. Moreover, our scheme will adapt and update the blacklist contents by using the method of statistic-based blacklist generation according to the actual network environment.

Current solutions using software become inefficient running on high speed high volume networks and will end up dropping packets. Hardware solutions are available and result in much higher efficiency but present problems such as flexibility and cost. Our proposed system uses a modified version of Snort, a robust widely deployed open-sourced NIDS. It has been found that Snort spends at least 30%-60% of its processing time doing pattern matching. Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then offloads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The software can then go on to other processing while it waits for the results from the FPGA. The hardware is able to process data at upto 1.7 GB/s on one Xilinx XC2VP100 FPGA. The design is scaleable and will allow for multiple FPGAs to be used in parallel to increase the processing speed even further.","","978-1-4244-1472-7;9781424414727","978-1-4244-1472-7;9781424414727","10.1109/FPT.2007.4439273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439273","","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Performance analysis;Quality of service;Robustness;Software architecture","field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;pattern matching;quality of service;security of data","Xilinx XC2VP100;field programmable gate array;high speed networks;high volume networks;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching;quality of service;software-hardware system","","2","","23","","","12-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure the security and reliability of a modernized power grid, the current deployment of millions of smart meters requires the development of innovative situational awareness solutions to prevent compromised devices from impacting the stability of the grid and the reliability of the energy distribution infrastructure. To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","978-1-4577-2005-5;9781457720055","978-0-7695-4590-5;9780769545905","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","39","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9;9781467345279","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is ""near continuous wave (CW)"" performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3;0780385063","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it. Additionally security is also provided for the data packets using the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and thus client is authenticated.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996163","DoS/DDoS;Hop-Count Filtering;Message Authentication Code;SYN Cookie;Sequence number;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;message authentication;transport protocols","ACK;CPU resource;DDos attack;Internet connection;MAC;SYN cookie;SYN packet;TCP mitigation strategy;Transmission Control Protocol mitigation strategy;acknowledgement;authenticated client;cloud access;cloud computing systems;connection packets;cyber attacks;data packets;distributed denial-of-service attack prevention;hardware infrastructures;hop count filtering mechanism;intrusion detection system;legitimate client;memory resource;message authentication code;purchasing cost reduction;security layer;sequence number encoding;spoofed client;temporarily cached information storage;third-party cloud servers;virtual machines;virtualization technology","","0","","14","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current security solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely mostly on the analyze of inbound network connections. This approach notably forgets the effects of a rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global authentication policy using methods like 802.1x to control all network communications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can be control in a collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks in a decentralized manner, preventing the risk of a security breach in the case of a failure.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318979","distributed communication;grid design;security architecture","Authentication;Collaboration;Communication system control;Communication system security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Microcomputers;Network servers;Virtual private networks","grid computing;middleware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","authentication policy;distributed security solution;firewalls;grid of security;intrusion detection systems;network security;virtual private networks","","5","","17","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach to detecting anomalies in business transactions and processes using a graph representation. In our graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) approach, anomalous instances of structural patterns are discovered in data that represent entities, relationships and actions.

Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

However, we find that the traceback message delivery problem in MBT, which is important to the successful completion of a traceback, has not been adequately studied in the literature. To address this issue, we present the design, analysis, and evaluation of opportunistic piggyback marking (OPM) for IP traceback in this paper. The OPM distinguishes itself from the existing works by decoupling the traceback message content encoding and delivery functions in MBT, and efficiently achieves expedited and robust traceback message delivery by exploiting piggyback marking opportunities. Based on the proposed OPM scheme, we then present the flexible marking-based traceback framework, which is a novel design paradigm for IP traceback and has several favorable features for practical deployment of IP traceback. Through the numerical analysis and the comprehensive simulation evaluations, we demonstrate that our design effectively reduces the traceback completion delay and router processing overhead, and increases the message delivery ratio compared with other baseline approaches.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2491299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299300","IP Traceback;IP traceback;Marking-based Traceback;Network Forensics;Opportunistic Piggyback Marking;marking-based traceback;network forensics;opportunistic piggyback marking","Delays;Encoding;IP networks;Probabilistic logic;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security","IP traceback;MBT approach;OPM scheme;cyber attacks;marking-based traceback;network diagnosis;opportunistic piggyback marking;traceback message content encoding;traceback message delivery problem;user traffic diagnosis","","","","51","","2015-10-15","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution does not belong to any of the existing intrusion detection approaches, since it relies on a set of robust, self-contained Random Walk Detectors (RWDs), which may freely move from node to node and randomly traverse a network, while monitoring each visiting node for malicious behaviour. RWDs exhibit a number of benefits including locality, simplicity, low overhead, and robustness to changes in topology. Moreover, the multi-layer, specification-based engine monitors the transport, network and data link layers of the protocol stack, providing an integrated solution capable of detecting the majority of security attacks occurring in MANETs.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741639","IDS;Intrusion detection system;MANETs;Mobile ad hoc networks;Random walks;Specification-based intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks;Databases;Engines;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Monitoring","","","","0","","17","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075;15302075","978-1-4244-6442-5;9781424464425","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect such attacks, we propose a semantic analysis framework that integrates network intrusion detection systems (IDSes) with a power flow analysis capable of estimating the execution consequences of control commands. To balance detection accuracy and latency, the parameters of the power flow analysis algorithm are dynamically adapted according to real-time system dynamics. Our experiments on IEEE 24-bus, 30-bus, and 39-bus systems and a 2736-bus system demonstrate that (1) by opening 3 transmission lines, an attacker can put the tested system into an insecure state, and (2) the semantic analysis can complete detection in 200 milliseconds for the large-scale 2736-bus system with about 0.78% false positives and 0.01% false negatives, which allow for timely responses to intrusions.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2547742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442543","Bro;SCADA;adaptive power flow analysis;intrusion detection system;semantic analysis","Generators;Load flow analysis;Mathematical model;Power grids;SCADA systems;Semantics","","","","","","","","2016-03-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

This method firstly constructs various simulation elements models; secondly it constructs a network security situation awareness simulation scenario based on these constructed models; thirdly it uses abstract packet-forwarding method to quickly infer network security behaviors in simulation scenario meanwhile recording important log information; finally it evaluates the value of network security situation based on the log information and forecasts the network security situation.

Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs.

Through the usage of such methods the attackers are able to evade existing security systems and prevent a comprehensive detection of the malicious activities. Therefore, it is often necessary to perform a manual investigation of complex attacks, to identify all steps and malicious activities that belong to an attack. One main objective of an investigation is to correlate existing events and reveal relations between different activities, to get a comprehensive overview of the attack. Due to the fact that the correlation is often done manually, this process is complex and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a new automated correlation approach that uses the tainting concept to identify related log events. The approach uses meaningful attributes as taint sources and a taint policy to propagate the taint to related events. For the identification of the correlations, it is also possible to use meta-information sources to support the correlation process. Furthermore, the tainting based approach allows to visualize the correlation results in a taint graph, which simplifies the traceability. We successfully evaluated the proposed approach with log events from a simulated attack where real world attack methods and tools were used. With the new approach it was possible to identify all events that recorded the malicious activities of the attacker and the created taint graph allowed a comprehensive retracing of the attack. Thus, the correlation approach can support investigations in an effective way, because it reduces the complexity of event correlation and the needed time.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502851","Attack Tracing;Event Attribute Tainting;Event Correlation;Event Tainting","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Correlation;IP networks;Manuals;Security","telecommunication security","analyzed attacks;attack tracing;event correlation;malicious activities;revealed attacks;security systems;taint graph","","","","13","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, users are not given the choices on which security services and mechanisms as well as which security level should be applied to their traffic. A security-enhanced quality of service-based (SQoS) network has been presented recently, with two major objectives. One objective is to offer the users elastic choices on the treatment of messages with appropriate security mechanisms with respect to their own QoS and budget requirements. Another objective is to facilitate interaction between security and QoS mechanisms in the most efficient manner by providing information to each other.

This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior. Simulation results provide evidence the effectiveness for achieving detection of exhaustion attacks with improved detection rate.","2164-7143;21647143","978-1-4673-5117-1;9781467351171","","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416593","DDoS;Detection;Exhaustion attacks;FLS;IEEE 802.15.4;MAC Layer;Security","Batteries;Fuzzy logic;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Security;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;computer network security;fuzzy logic;personal area networks","DDoS;IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer;LR-WPAN;communication capabilities;computation capabilities;detection mechanism;distributed denial of service;exhaustion attack detection;fuzzy logic system;low rate wireless personal area network;malicious attacks;security system;sensor power;sensory resources;untrusted environments","","0","","29","","","27-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes.

A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device.

Taxonomies based on attacker goals are attack-centric; those based on defender goals are defense-centric. Defenders need a way of determining whether or not their detectors will detect a given attack. It is suggested that a defense-centric taxonomy would suit this role more effectively than an attack-centric taxonomy. This paper presents a new, defense-centric attack taxonomy, based on the way that attacks manifest as anomalies in monitored sensor data. Unique manifestations, drawn from 25 attacks, were used to organize the taxonomy, which was validated through exposure to an intrusion-detection system, confirming attack detect ability. The taxonomy's predictive utility was compared against that of a well-known extant attack-centric taxonomy. The defense-centric taxonomy is shown to be a more effective predictor of a detector's ability to detect specific attacks, hence informing a defender that a given detector is competent against an entire class of attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9;0769520529","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311881","","Computer science;Detectors;Laboratories;Monitoring;Operating systems;Sensor systems;Taxonomy","authorisation;computer crime","Lincoln taxonomy;attack classification;attack detectability;attack manifestations;attack-centric taxonomy;defense-centric taxonomy;intrusion detection;sensor data monitoring","","13","","30","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Accelerating Anomaly-Based IDS Using Neural Network on GPU","N. T. T. Van; T. N. Thinh","Fac. of Comput.

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on the heterogeneous flows problem that various flows consuming different amount of multiple resources. We develop a Resource Aware Queuing (RAQ) system to classify various flows into different categories according to their resource requirement amounts, and then schedule their processing order based on the switch multiple resource utilization. Based on the resource aware scheduling we also modify the packets dropping strategy so that the sending rates of different flows are also correspondingly modulated. We evaluate RAQ performance via simulation experiments and the results demonstrate that RAQ can improve network resources utilization and throughput without imposing serious negative impact on packets delays.","","","","10.1109/ICCSNT.2013.6967229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967229","RAQ;multi-resource sharing;packet scheduling","Bandwidth;Random access memory;Resource management;Schedules;Scheduling algorithms;Switches;Throughput","Big Data;cloud computing;computer networks;queueing theory","big data computing;bottleneck resource;cloud computing;heterogeneous flows problem;multiresource in-network nodes;resource aware packet scheduling;resource aware queuing system;resource aware scheduling","","0","","12","","","12-13 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
