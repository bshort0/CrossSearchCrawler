Although increasing IDSs are developed in the literature, network security administrators are faced with the task of analyzing enormous alerts produced from the analysis of different event streams. The intrusion detection model needs to be continuously tuned in order to reduce correlative alerts and help the administrator to determine accurate and critical attacks. In this work, an alert correlation detection module is proposed to analyze the alerts produced by IDSs and provides a more succinct and overall view of intrusions. An automatically tuned IDS rules generation module based on fuzzy logic technique is used to block the highly correlative alerts.

It is very usefully due to its self maintenance, self organizing and by reason of mobility of wireless communication. Two major issues are found in such kind of network performance and security. In mobile ad-hoc network there are so many attacks which reduced the performance of network. In this paper we have focus only active attacks in network layer. Ad Hoc On-Demand Vector Routing protocol is a reactive routing protocol for ad hoc networks that maintain routes only between nodes which want to communicate by using routing messages. AODV provide loop free routes during link breakages. SAODV is a secure routing protocol based on trust model for mobile ad-hoc network. For provide security and increase performance in MANET, we have applied SAODV protocol and our solution uses Hybrid Cryptography Technique (DES, RSA Algorithms) on SAODV. This paper presents comparison based on simulation of AODV, SAODV routing protocol of MANET with Different parameters like energy, packet delivery ratio and throughput. The proposed cryptographic routing algorithm is implemented through the NS2 network simulation environment. The outcome of our proposed method the energy is low; packet delivery ratio and throughput are high as compare to traditional method.","","978-1-4799-8163-2;9781479981632","","10.1109/IC4.2015.7375688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7375688","AODV;DES and RSA algorithms;MANET;SAODV","Encryption;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;DES;MANET;NS2 network simulation environment;RSA algorithms;SAODV protocol;active attacks;ad hoc on-demand vector routing protocol;cryptographic routing algorithm;hybrid cryptography technique;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile devices;mobile wireless network;network layer;secure data transmission;secure routing protocol;trust model;wireless communication","","","","8","","","10-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the storage required for traffic traces has greatly expanded due to increasing network speeds. In this paper, we selectively cap the packet payload to reduce write speed and storage requirements on hard drives and further reduce the computational burden of packet analysis. The proposed techniques take advantage of most packet payloads being useless for analysis purposes, because they are either encrypted or in a proprietary application non-readable format. Conversely, non-ASCII packets from well-known protocols and protocols with some ASCII data are fully captured as they may be potentially useful for network analysis. We have named this approach as selective capping, and we have implemented and integrated it into a high-speed network driver and a software module at user level, to make its operation more transparent and faster to upper layer applications. The results are promising, and selective capping achieves multi-Gb/s rates by exploiting low-level hardware and software techniques to meet the fastest network rates.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2559198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460894","Interleaved ASCII;Packet Storage;Packet storage;Selective Capping;Traffic capture;interleaved ASCII;selective capping;traffic capture","Cryptography;Hard disks;Internet;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network management;telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection;hard drive;high-speed network driver;network analyst;network manager;nonASCII packets;packet analysis;packet payload selective capping;software module;traffic behavior","","","","25","","2016-04-27","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1;9781479939251","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However for a developer or team working on any network project who need to perform DPI, there is always the issue of using a third party source which may involve added cost or implementing it themselves which requires time and study of protocols, signatures and the nuances of pattern matching. The paper proposes a solution to the above problem using an adaptive grammar generation algorithm. This method reduces the entropy among similar results given by different patterns. Immense customizability is the foremost advantage of this method. Existing grammars for new signatures can be combined into a single grammar easily rather than new grammars be generated from raw target strings. The paper, thus, looks to limit the detailed knowledge requirement for the design of signature detection procedures and in doing so re-use existing procedures which have been thoroughly debugged and tested.","","978-1-4673-0060-5;9781467300605","","10.1109/EMS.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6131199","Deep Packet Inspection;Grammar;Pattern Matching;Regular Expressions","Educational institutions;Entropy;Grammar;Inspection;Pattern matching;Production;Protocols","grammars;pattern matching;security of data","DPI;DoS;IDS;adaptive grammar generation;adaptive pattern matching;deep packet inspection;denial of service;entropy;immense customizability;intrusion detection system;signature detection procedure","","0","","6","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensors have become an excellent tool for military applications involving intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, information gathering and smart logistics support in an unknown deployed area. Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out. Our IDS is simple to employ, requires minimal processing and data storage.

The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect insider attacks by analyzing these packet delivery records.

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated. It can also handle repetition of both single and multi-symbol sub-expressions.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673707","","","computer network security;digital signatures;finite automata;symbol manipulation","Glushkov nondeterministic flnite automata;NFA;NIDS;NIDS rule sets;attack signatures;bit-parallel architecture;constrained repetitions;deep packet inspection;hardware acceleration;multisymbol subexpressions;network intrusion detection systems;regular expression repetitions;standard BP system","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

Intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems provide a limited solution to a concurrent problem. Proactive preemptive techniques employed by intrusion prevention systems are more effective than the reactive techniques employed by intrusion detection systems. However these techniques are not adequate to counter a large scale distributed denial of service attacks. In this paper, we propose a countermeasure which uses dynamic agents to mitigate denial of service attacks. These dynamics agents are called Gnipper vaccine. Gnipper vaccine provides an effective technique capable of providing an enterprise-wide response. Gnipper vaccine is an agent which resides on the host computer capable of dropping any malicious packets.

However, AID techniques suffer from higher false alarm rate compared to signature-based intrusion detection techniques. In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm.

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1092-1648;10921648","978-1-4244-1587-8;9781424415878","978-1-4244-1588-5;9781424415885","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","13","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks.

Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9;9781457713859","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","4","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to support emerging services, it is clear that a higher degree of monitoring functionality is needed within networks. One approach is to use the programmability and performance of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to allow distributed monitoring but this present challenges around memory usage and highlights the need for a strategically different approach to how flows are monitored. A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces.

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network. The data captured will undergo intense data mining through clustering and then performing classification using BOAT algorithm to detect the presence of intruders on the cloud.

This paper presents Bezoar, an automated full-system virtual machine-based approach to recover from zero-day control-flow hijacking attacks. Bezoar tracks down the source of network bytes in the system and after an attack, replays the checkpointed run while ignoring inputs from the malicious source. We evaluated our proof-of-concept prototype on six notorious exploits for Linux and Windows. In all cases, it recovered the full system state and resumed execution. Bezoar incurs low overhead to the virtual machine: less than 1% for the recovery and log components and approximately 1.4X for the memory monitor component that tracks down network bytes, for five SPEC INT 2000 benchmarks.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","978-1-4244-2066-7;9781424420667","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575125","","Automatic control;Condition monitoring;Face detection;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Target tracking;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","Internet;Linux;checkpointing;invasive software;virtual machines","Bezoar;Internet worms;Linux;Windows;automated virtual machine;checkpointing;full-system recovery;system availability","","0","","50","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In MANET, wide area communication on wireless networks can be realized because a node relays other node's packets by adopting a multi-hop routing protocol. Security is an indispensable issue in MANET because an unknown node may join the network easily. However, the demand for the level of authentication and its response time is different depending on the environment and applications. Thus, we focus on real-time control of the security mechanism for MANET. In this paper, we have established multi-hop communication environment and introduced methods to control secure connections by applying IPsec as an encryption scheme, on top of the general-purpose operating systems with enabled preemption for interruption. Under such conditions, we have measured response time of CPU with or without load of other applications.

In this context we propose a flexible network probe which is a foundation stone for further network measurement and monitoring. The architecture of the probe is based on a network acceleration card with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and a host computer. The configuration for FPGA chips is automatically generated by a configuration program according to the user's definition of the monitored values in order to save hardware resources and increase the throughput. The definition of the monitoring process is described using XML, transformed to VHDL and synthesized.

Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors. The technique has been successfully applied to detect attacks against widely-deployed applications, including the Apache Web server and the OpenSSH server.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377227","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Computer science;Computer security;Data mining;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","Internet;digital signatures;operating system kernels;program debugging;security of data;software maintenance","Apache Web server;OpenSSH server;application-level auditing;application-level bugs;application-logic errors;application-specific signatures;binary rewriting;buffer overflows;host security;intrusion detection systems;legacy systems;offline language tool;operating system kernel;syslog entries;system calls","","1","2","38","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These monitoring tools assist system administrators in assessing and improving the health of their infrastructure. A successful attack on the infrastructure monitoring tools grants the attacker elevated power over the monitoring tasks, and eventually over some management functionality of the interface or over hosts running those interfaces. Additionally, detailed and accurate fingerprinting and reconnaissance of a target infrastructure is possible when such interfaces are publicly exposed. A successful reconnaissance allows an attacker to craft an efficient secondstage attacks, such as targeted, mimicry and blended attacks. We provide in this paper a comprehensive security analysis of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools for grids, clusters and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. We also provide insights based on the infrastructure data openly exposed over the Internet. The wide use of some of the most popular infrastructure monitoring tools makes this data exposure possible. For example, we found such monitoring interfaces to expose infrastructure details of systems inside many high-profile organizations, including two top national laboratories for nuclear research and one top Internet non-profit foundation. We also present our findings on a plethora of web vulnerabilities in the entire version-span of such monitoring tools, and discuss at a high-level the possible attacks.

This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","2","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Modified whirlpool hash based bloom filter for networking and security applications","K. Saravanan; A. Senthilkumar; P.

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices.

Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices.

The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4799-8466-4;9781479984664","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders.

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice.

A DoS attack generates a large amount of traffic, which will occupy the bandwidth and degrade the quality of video. The proposed framework consists of two components: intrusion detection and adaptive transmission management. The intrusion detection component monitors the incoming traffic to the server, detects the attacks, and interacts with the adaptive transmission management component; while the adaptive transmission management component is designed to improve QoS of the video via the efficient utilization of the network resources. With the detection of the DoS attacks, the bandwidth occupied by the attacks can be reduced and protected for video transmission.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals.

A numbers of intruders attempt to gain unauthorized access into computer network. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a stronger strategy to provide security. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient IDS by selecting relevant futures from NSL-KDD dataset and using Logistic Regression (LR) based classifier. To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation. From the number of feature sets, we have selected the fittest set of features using our proposed Best Feature Set Selection (BFSS) method. After selecting the most relevant features from NSL-KDD data set, we used LR based classification. Thus, an efficient IDS is created by applying the concept of GA with BFSS for feature selection and LR for classification to detect network intrusions.","","978-1-4799-4446-0;9781479944460","","10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060117","BFSS;GA;Gradient Descent;IDS;LR;Mutual Correlation;NSL-KDD","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Sociology;Statistics;Training","feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data","BFSS;GA;IDS;LR classifier;best feature set selection method;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;logistic regression;mutual correlation","","0","","19","","","7-8 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","1530-2075;15302075","1-4244-0909-8;1424409098","1-4244-0910-1;1424409101","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Conditional disclosure of encrypted whitelists for DDoS attack mitigation","G. Bianchi; H. Rajabi; A. Caponi; G. Picierro","","2013 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)","20140605","2013","","","200","206","Defensive techniques against Internet-scale attacks can significantly benefit from sharing network security data among different domains. One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","2166-0077;21660077","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system consists of several sets of a camera and a PC connected via network. Prior to the monitoring, a system manager would set up several sensitive planes in the world using a GUI. To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC method. Then the contour of the object region on an image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. The contours are collected to a single PC and existence of a common region is judged. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. If the intruder occludes the critical point on the sensitive planes from the all cameras to avoid observation, the system also alerts to the user. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3-D protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary. This system does not require us to calibrate the camera because this system is based on 2-D homography.","","0-7803-8352-4;0780383524","","10.1109/MFI-2003.2003.1232673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323821","","Cameras;Graphical user interfaces;Humans;Image reconstruction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Object detection;Protection;Robustness;Shape","cameras;computerised monitoring;graphical user interfaces;image processing;image sensors;multidimensional signal processing;safety systems","GUI;PC cluster;camera;contour-based multiplanar visual hull method;image sensors;intrusion detection system;monitoring system","","0","","3","","","4-6 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its open nature and the lack of robust security mechanisms, SIP is vulnerable to several attacks similar to those existing in Internet infrastructure, such as the flooding attack. An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme does not require any special detection device or firewall at the SIP server. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in SIP Express Router (SER) and the obtained results have confirmed its effectiveness.","","978-1-4673-5615-2;9781467356152","978-1-4673-5614-5;9781467356145","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549057","Denial of Service;INVITE Flooding Attack;Security;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)","Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors","IP networks;Internet telephony;computer network security;network servers;routing protocols;signalling protocols;video communication","INVITE flooding attack;IP address;Internet;REGISTER request header;SER;SIP express router;SIP server;critical number;firewall;incoming INVITE request analysis;lightweight countermeasure;robust detection scheme;robust security mechanism;session initiation protocol;transition state table;video communication;voice communication","","0","","13","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, malicious users are constantly looking for ways to by-pass the security features of these products, and many times they will succeed. In order to enhance the capabilities of computer network security devices such as firewalls, the Distributed Network Applications Laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology is investigating the use of a distributed Internet security architecture known as the general network security collaboration framework (GNSCF).

We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5;9781424462315","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour.

Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture.

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT.

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0;0769525490","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","4","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs have attracted intensive interest from both academia and industry due to their wide application in civil and military scenarios. In hostile scenarios, it is very important to protect WSNs from malicious attacks. Due to various resource limitations and the salient features of a wireless sensor network, the security design for such networks is significantly challenging. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of WSN security issues that were investigated by researchers in recent years and that shed light on future directions for WSN security.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2008.4625802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625802","","Cryptographic protocols;Hardware;Interference;Jamming;Manufacturing;Monitoring;National security;Public key cryptography;Software algorithms;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","hardware manufacturing technology;malicious attacks;network security;wireless sensor networks","","66","3","159","","","Third Quarter 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The needs of collection, storage, management, analysis, and measurement of the subsequent teletraffic have been emerged as one of very important issues. So far many studies for detecting anomaly teletraffic have been done. However, measurement and analysis studies for big data in cloud computing environments are not actively being made based on Hadoop. Thus, this paper presents for detecting anomaly teletraffic using stochastic self-similarity based on Hadoop. All simulations are conducted under control of our proposed platform, called ATM tool, for anomaly teletraffic intrusion detection system on Hadoop. Our numerical results show that the values of the estimated Hurst parameter obtained from the anomaly teletraffic are much higher when compared to ordinary local area network traffic.","2157-0418;21570418","978-1-4799-2509-4;9781479925094","","10.1109/NBiS.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685410","Anomaly teletraffic detection;Hadoop;Hurst parameter;big data;cloud computing;stochastic self-similarity","Data handling;Data storage systems;Distributed databases;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Stochastic processes","computer network security;distributed processing;stochastic processes;telecommunication traffic","ATM tool;Hadoop;Hurst parameter;Internet application;Internet users;anomaly teletraffic detection;big data;cloud computing environments;local area network traffic;stochastic self-similarity;teletraffic analysis;teletraffic collection;teletraffic intrusion detection system;teletraffic management;teletraffic measurement;teletraffic storage","","1","","20","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
