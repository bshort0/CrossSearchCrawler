In this work we propose a new architecture for IPPT (IP Packet Tracing) based on the traditional concept of keeping traffic logs stored in Bloom filters. The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed. The communication among the system's components preserves the confidentiality of the packet's information.

Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability.

The paper focuses on the design aspects of such an intrusion detection system by integrating different artificial intelligence techniques and a mobile agent architecture. Specifically, IBM's Aglets (TM) Software Development Kit (ASDK) is used as the base agent architecture, along with adaptive resonance theory (ART-2) neural networks for network pattern classification, and a fuzzy logic controller for decision/action resolution.

The introduction of virtualization layer increases new security risks which should be restricted and confined by more stringent access control techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines. A VMM-based access control mechanism is designed to confine the VM's behaviors in a fine-grained manner. Ihac is implemented and evaluated in iVIC platform.

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

Static analysis methods are able to identify many known vulnerabilities; however, they suffer from a high rate of false-positives. The creation of a mechanism that can verify identified vulnerabilities is therefore warranted. We propose a contract-based security assertion monitoring framework (CB SAMF) for reducing the number of security vulnerabilities that are exploitable.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed.

The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate.

Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components. Our analysis identifies different candidate algorithms for the different AMI components' IDSs, respectively.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2294120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720175","Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);data stream mining;intrusion detection system (IDS);smart grid (SG)","Computer architecture;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Smart grids","authorisation;cryptography;data mining;smart meters;smart power grids","KDD Cup 1999 data set;advanced metering infrastructure;authentication;authorization;data concentrator;data stream mining;encryption;intrusion detection system;primary security;security enhancement;smart grid;smart meter","","2","","38","","2014-01-23","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But the properties of constrained resources make WSNs vulnerable to different types of intrusions such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which result in a large number of compromised nodes. For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes. Finally, the system is analyzed and verified. The simulation results indicate that the compromised nodes can self-recover effectively and network total energy consumption also is reduced effectively.","","","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2013.6823943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823943","DoS attacks;Intrusion detection;Sef-recovery;Wireless sensor networks","Computer crime;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;software agents;wireless sensor networks","agent based intrusion detection;denial of service attacks;network total energy consumption;self-recovery system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","12","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6;9781424422326","978-1-4244-2233-3;9781424422333","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods.

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605766","","Automatic control;Computer security;Control systems;Delay;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Runtime;Throughput","Internet;security of data;source coding;telecommunication security","accurate application-specific sandboxing policy;cybersecurity threats;hijacking attacks;production-mode network server;program semantics-aware intrusion detection system;source code;system call monitoring","","0","","24","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC. Indeed, we have also managed to maintain the video analytics accuracy at 100% for given test dataset, in this implementation of the system.","","978-1-4799-2208-6;9781479922086","","10.1109/SPC.2013.6735111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735111","CUDA;GPGPU;parallelization;streaming;video analytics;video surveillance system","Accuracy;Cameras;Central Processing Unit;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Process control;Streaming media","graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;security of data;video cameras;video streaming;video surveillance","CUDA;GPGPU;camera surveillance area;compute unified device architecture;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion detection system;large scale camera deployment;macroparallelization;microparallelization;multinode video analytics processing;people tracking;real-time multinode streaming;surveillance activity;video hardware cost reduction;video surveillance system","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

One difficult class of attack to defend against is user-initiated malicious software (malware) execution. User-initiated malware penetrates the security perimeter with assistance provided, either intentionally or unintentionally, by and enterprise's end users. These users assist the attacker by downloading malware from a Web site, invoking malware arriving as e-mail attachments and introducing malware inside the perimeter via the unauthorized use of foreign media, e.g., floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or unauthorized media devices, e.g., USB drives, or unauthorized wireless networking hardware. In this paper, we describe characteristics of the most widely used defense techniques for the blocking of user-initiated malware and why these techniques are insufficient. We then introduce a module verification strategy that eliminates, or at least severely reduce, this problem by extending the classic ""defense in depth"" network security strategy. We then describe how the augmentation of a standard operating system loader to include references to a database of cryptographic hashes of module executables can be used to implement this strategy.

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs.

We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption.

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","978-1-4244-2282-1;9781424422821","978-1-4244-2283-8;9781424422838","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","1","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","5","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the authentication method used by computers on the network affects its safety. Static authentication methods are applied only once at the beginning of a user session. Unfortunately, these methods provide no protection from the interactions a user has after they are logged on and using the system. An ongoing dynamic authentication supplements an intrusion detection system by recognizing a masquerader, or a legitimate user's change of intent. In this paper, we statistically analyze the underlying distributions of the time between user commands and develop an analytic model that emulates the underlying mathematical properties of user behaviors. From this, we show how the probabilities of users executing a sequence of commands during a session can be ascertained. Finally, via our experimental results, we show how the efficacy of dynamic authentication schemes in networked computing environments can be improved by incorporating our techniques.","","0-7803-9445-3;0780394453","0-7803-9446-1;0780394461","10.1109/IDAACS.2005.283004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4062155","Computer Security;Dynamic Authentication;Network Security;Semi-Markov Processes","Authentication;Biometrics;Computer networks;Computer security;Conferences;Data acquisition;Frequency;Intelligent networks;System testing;Timing","computer network management;message authentication;statistical distributions;telecommunication security","computer networks;dynamic authentication mechanism;inter-command time distributions;intrusion detection system;legitimate user intent change;masquerader recognition;real-time network security;user probabilities","","0","","6","","","5-7 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","1","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on the problem of anonymizing IP addresses in a trace. More specifically, we are interested in prefix-preserving anonymization in which the prefix relationship among IP addresses is preserved in the anonymized trace, making such a trace usable in situations where prefix relationships are important. The goal of our work is two fold. First, we develop a cryptography-based, prefix-preserving anonymization technique that is provably as secure as the existing well-known TCPdpriv scheme, and unlike TCPdpriv, provides consistent prefix-preservation in large scale distributed setting. Second, we evaluate the security properties inherent in all prefix-preserving IP address anonymization schemes (including TCPdpriv). Through the analysis of Internet backbone traffic traces, we investigate the effect of some types of attacks on the security of any prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm. We also derive results for the optimum manner in which an attack should proceed, which provides a bound on the effectiveness of attacks in general.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-1856-7;0769518567","","10.1109/ICNP.2002.1181415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181415","","Binary trees;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Decision making;Stress","Internet;cryptography;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP addresses;Internet backbone traffic traces;Internet research;TCPdpriv scheme;confidential information;cryptography;measurement-based security evaluation;optimisation;prefix-preserving IP address anonymity;prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm;private information;real-world traffic traces;security attacks;security properties","","18","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4673-0714-7;9781467307147","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This distributed security model adopts a bottom-up approach such that each cluster of end-user hosts is first secured using the CSG architecture. These different CSGs are then centrally managed by the Network Administrator. A file-based firewall update mechanism is used for dynamic real-time security. IPsec is used to secure the firewall policy update distribution while X.509 certificates cater for sender/receiver authentication.

By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of deep packet inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2321898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814316","Flow export;IPFIX;Internet measurements;NetFlow;network monitoring","Data analysis;Electronic mail;High-speed networks;Internet;Telecommunication congestion control;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;data analysis;protocols;telecommunication traffic","IPFIX;Internet measurements;NetFlow;data analysis;data collection;data loss;deep packet inspection approach;flow analysis;flow data artifacts;flow monitoring;high-speed networks;packet capture;packet observation;packet-based traffic analysis;protocols;sound flow measurements;traffic monitoring","","18","","97","","2014-05-12","Fourthquarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many-to-one communication the adversary attracts its surrounding neighbor nodes with false routing information and fake identities. The existing researches have focused on single layer attacks. In their work they target only one specific layer and detect the attack, without considering other layers into account. Our proposed detection technique maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross layer features and Mobile agent based approach in two phases. In first phase, attacks are detected by correlating the cross layer features such as MAC and Network layers. During second phase, if the attacks are detected, mobile agent based technique is applied to prevent the attack. Here the data is forwarded through the mobile agent. The mobile agent solves the security problem by using three step negotiations. Through this mobile agent based approach, the false positive rate can be reduced and improving the energy efficiency than the existing approach.","","","","10.1109/ICICES.2016.7518935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518935","Cross layer;Mobile agent;Security;Sinkhole attack;Sybil attack","Base stations;Cross layer design;Feature extraction;Mobile agents;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","25-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework uses unsupervised learning at runtime, can perform fast anomaly detection ""on the fly"", and can quickly adapt to system load fluctuations and user behavior shifts.

The detection of this type of attack at the network level can overcome the scalability issue of host-based detection methods. In this paper, we provide a machine learning approach for the detection of SSH brute force attacks at the network level. Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models. Our results show that the models built upon these features provide excellent performances for the detection of brute force attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424322","Aggregated Netflows;Brute Force;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Force;Intrusion detection","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","Netflow data;Netflow feature;SSH brute force attack traffic;SSH failed login data;SSH traffic;aggregated netflow data;campus network;computer network;discern brute force traffic;extracting discriminative feature;failed login traffic;host-based detection method;inspection;legitimate user;machine learning approach;machine learning model;machine learning task;network level;password combination;prevalent attack;representative collection","","","","21","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5;9781457700255","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An essential requirement of such tools is the generation of normal and malicious SCADA traffic. In this paper, we present an automated tool to generate a malicious SCADA traffic to be used to evaluate such systems. We consider the traffic generation of the popular SCADA Modbus protocol. The characteristics of the generated traffic are derived from Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS) Modbus rules.

However, in most of these cases the file has to be either run in a dynamic environment or has to be disassembled to look at its content. We present here a novel method to look at the files without the need of executing or disassembling them.

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy. In addition, the training data classification performance of the actively learned model was comparable to that of the C4.5 decision tree.","","978-1-4244-8097-5;9781424480975","","10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558967","","Artificial neural networks;Biological system modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Training;Training data","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","C4.5 decision tree;DARPA KDD-1999;active learning;computer network intrusion detection;data mining;machine learning techniques;network traffic instances;neural networks;very large training dataset size","","2","","29","","","4-6 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A clustering model based on self-organizing ant colony networks (CSOACN) is systematically proposed for intrusion detection system. Instead of using the linear segmentation function of the CSI model, here we propose to use a nonlinear probability conversion function and can help to solve linearly inseparable problems. Using a set of benchmark data from 1998 DARPA, we demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of CSOACN","2164-7143;21647143","0-7695-2528-8;0769525288","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021813","","Access control;Adaptive systems;Application software;Computer networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Educational institutions;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines","graph theory;pattern clustering;probability;security of data;self-adjusting systems","clustering model;intrusion detection;linear segmentation function;nonlinear probability conversion function;selforganizing ant colony networks","","0","","18","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, additional security means are mandatory to cope with the high security requirements of smart city applications. We present a framework to evaluate lightweight intrusion detection techniques for CoAP applications. This framework combines an OMNeT++ simulation with C/C++ application code that also runs on real hardware. As the result of our work, we used our framework to evaluate intrusion detection techniques for a smart public transport application that uses CoAP. Our first evaluations indicate that a hybrid IDS approach is a favorable choice for smart city applications.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997468","Critical Infrastructure protection;Intrusion detection;OMNeT++;Simulation;Smart city","Cities and towns;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protocols;Routing","cloud computing;mobile computing;protocols;public administration;public transport;security of data;smart cities","C/C++ application code;CoAP;OMNeT++ simulation;cloud computing;constrained application protocol;intrusion detection;resource-constrained devices;smart city applications;smart public transport application","","1","","15","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
