This paper presents a solution called API invocation fingerprint detection (AIFD) to eliminate overflow vulnerability with very low performance penalty. The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches. Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state. In this paper, we present principle of buffer overflow attacks, implementation details of AIFD, and experimental results of both penetration resistance and the performance impact of this solution.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370697","AIFD;API hook;Buffer overflow attack","Buffer overflow;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Operating systems;Protection;Runtime","application program interfaces;buffer storage;fingerprint identification;operating system kernels;program compilers;security of data","API invocation fingerprint detection;API-hook-based solutions;buffer overflow attack;operating system kernel;program compiler","","0","","19","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a distributed scheme that can mitigate the damage caused by DDoS through a coordinated detection and response framework. This proposed scheme composes of a number of heterogeneous defense systems which cooperate with each other in protecting Internet servers. We have set up a network testbed for carrying out extensive experiments using real server machines, routers and software attack tools. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme can greatly improve the throughput of legitimate traffic and reduce the attack traffic during DDoS attacks.

Operation and maintenance issues have become more and more complex due to the gradual extension of the Ethernet technology from local- to wide-area networks and the increasingly frequent use of layer-2 virtual private networks. End-to-end Ethernet network management is currently under standardization, with a focus on connectivity fault management and performance management. However, none of the tools and research prototypes available to date integrate service-level monitoring with fault management functions such as event correlation or root cause analysis for interconnected Ethernet networks. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing an integrated service-level monitoring and fault management framework. Our event processing module can handle various events generated by network nodes or pollers. We also describe service-level monitoring and fault management methods that are fine-tuned for managing end-to-end multi- provider Ethernet services.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2007.030103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275032","","Environmental management;Ethernet networks;Monitoring;Neodymium;Petri nets;Prototypes;Quality management;Quality of service;Standardization;Virtual private networks","fault diagnosis;local area networks;monitoring;quality of service;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability","Ethernet fault management;end-to-end multi provider Ethernet service;end-to-end service quality;local-wide-area network;network operation/maintenance;service-level monitoring integration","","6","5","1","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use the ns-2 network simulator to demonstrate the vulnerability of the MintRoute protocol to link quality attacks by a malicious node. We then propose a novel ""sequence number gap trick"" as a lightweight means to test for and detect the presence of a malicious attacker.

This can be formulated as a dependability problem as follows. Two processors jointly provide a real-time service which can be completed by exactly one processor. Assuming each processor is allowed to announce only one-bit information to decide which one to process the job, inevitably some of the jobs will get lost if only classical resources are used.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using results from published studies, we compare these four solutions against different requirements highlighting trade-offs in performance, space, attack resistance, and cost.

"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Sui Song; C. N. Manikopoulos","","2006 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","1","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Psyco-Virt architecture includes a cluster of virtual machines, the monitored VMs, which run the OS and applications of interest, and a further VM, the introspection one. Several agents distributed across the monitored VMs execute network and host IDS tools to discover attempted intrusions/attacks on the monitored VMs. The introspection VM makes the detection tools trustworthy by running an introspector and a director to discover any attempt to maliciously modify the kernel, the agents and the IDSes hosted on a monitored VM. On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected. In such cases, a monitored VM can either be stopped or frozen and its current state saved in a file for a later, deeper inspection. After describing Psyco-Virt, we discuss some examples of agents and functions using introspection and present preliminary results and performance figures of a first prototype.","","0-7695-2876-7;0769528767","978-0-7695-2876-2;9780769528762","10.1109/IAS.2007.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299776","integrity;introspection;intrusion detection;network security;system;virtual machines","Buildings;Condition monitoring;Filters;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","security of data;virtual machines","Psyco-Virt architecture;data exchange;high assurance intrusion detection tool;network intrusion detection technologies;trustworthy intrusion detection;virtual machine introspection","","7","2","26","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection Systems are deployed to detect infections, but they raise many correlated alerts for each infection, requiring a large manual investigation effort. This paper presents a novel method with a goal of determining which alerts are correlated, by applying Neural Networks and clustering, thus reducing the number of alerts to manually process. The main advantage of the method is that no domain knowledge is required for designing feature extraction or any other part, as such knowledge is inferred by Neural Networks. Evaluation has been performed with traffic traces of real bot binaries executed in a lab setup. The method is trained on labelled Intrusion Detection System alerts and is capable of correctly predicting which of seven incidents an alert pertains, 56.15% of the times. Based on the observed performance it is concluded that the task of understanding Intrusion Detection System alerts can be handled by a Neural Network, showing the potential for reducing the need for manual processing of alerts. Finally, it should be noted that, this is achieved without any feature engineering and with no use of domain specific knowledge.","","","","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2016.7502344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502344","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Neurons;Training","invasive software;neural nets;pattern clustering","bot malware infections;enable botmaster;form botnets;intrusion detection alerts;intrusion detection systems;neural network;pattern clustering","","","","","","","13-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution.

Prompt action by DNS server operators minimized the duration and impact of the attack, which had little effect on overall Internet performance. Intrusion detection systems are researched and developed to detect attacks from outside world since 1980. Intrusion detection systems create an alert data or log data when detect an intrusion. But Many IDS uses heterogeneous data set, so these data must be mapped to another format. IDWG in IETF proposed IDMEF. This paper designs an alert data format compatible IDMEF. The secure networking framework is consisted of SGS and CPCS. SGS acts as an intrusion detection system on edge of network ingress point, and CPCS acts as a higher-level server. SGS makes an alert data compatible IDMEF and sends it to CPCS. CPCS parses an IDMEF alert data and makes an alert object for using correlation analysis. SGS can see its area only, but CPCS can see wide network area. CPCS can detect more complex attacks as well as support integrated management through cooperating each other. In the view of alert processing we converted raw alert data to Ladon-alert data to support interoperability. We use IDMEF-compatible alert datat structure.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7;9781424491537","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way.

Virtualization technology which allows more efficient use of existing physical hardware, as well as some advantages including cost reduction, labor loss and performance improvement, contains several innovations in security, especially in system security. Software applications such as antivirus, firewall, end point security installed on the servers to ensure system security causes performance loss on the network and servers.

Because of the challenges in programming such architectures, realizing this promise has proved to be difficult. In this paper, we describe the design of Lagniappe, a programming environment that simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-* architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification - expressed using a model-driven development framework - of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-* platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317815","","Computer architecture;Computer graphics;Dynamic programming;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Process design;Programming environments;Service oriented architecture;Virtual private networks;Web server","message passing;multiprogramming;object-oriented languages;programming environments;software portability","Lagniappe;declarative specification;high-throughput applications;hybrid programming model;model-driven development framework;multi-* architectures;multi-threaded architectures;multiprocessor;multiprogramming;portable application;procedural specification;programming environment;target hardware platform","","0","","28","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4;0769529224","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dramatic features of HIS like distributability, uniqueness, adaptability, mobility, imperfect-detection, and anomaly-detection, have grabbed the attention of computational researchers for adopting HIS principles to design AIS that are robust, scalable, highly flexible, resilient to sub-versioning, and degrade gracefully. Designers of AIS make use of their creative abilities for designing computational systems by extracting corresponding metaphors from HIS. AIS is growing as a core paradigm for a wide application area including: intrusion detection, data analysis, pattern recognition, optimization, robotics, distributed control, and bioinformatics etc. The field of AIS, being in its infancy, bears enormous research potential. This work aims to throw light on some prospective research issues in the field.

The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching","cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme","","23","3","23","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3;9781424469383","978-1-4244-6939-0;9781424469390","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.","","978-1-4244-9276-3;9781424492763","","10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026885","TrustCloud framework;accountability;cloud computing;cloud computing security;data-centric logging;trust","Business;Cloud computing;Google;History;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data;system monitoring","IT systems;TrustCloud;cloud computing security;cloud computing trust;cloud security;computing services;data access;data accountability;data ownership;data retention;data transfer;data-centric logging-accountability;data-centric thinking;security of data;system-centric logging-accountability","","12","","13","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a proactive solution called MMT (Montimage1 Monitoring Tool) that allows facilitating network security and performance monitoring and operation troubleshooting. We demonstrate the improvements of MMT in comparison with other similar tools. Especially, we assess MMT to deal with a practical case-study in which we analyze the User-Agent field in HTTP headers to determine abnormal activities. Indeed, novel observations figure out the usefulness of the User-Agent field in HTTP requests as a good source to facilitate abnormal activities detection within an abundant traffic. There are eventually several researches alarming the vulnerabilities of the User-Agent field and proposing some manual solution including a combination of tools. However, existing countermeasures are rather passive and do not allow real-time detection.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces ""noise"" due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","18","7","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.","","978-1-4244-2113-8;9781424421138","978-1-4244-2114-5;9781424421145","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593135","Frequency pattern (FP);Information security;Intrusion Detection;System-call sequence;Tree pattern (TP)","Aquaculture;Automation;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent control;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","data mining;security of data","FP;TP;computer intrusions;computer system;frequency patterns;information security;intrusion detection;operating system;sequential mining;short sequence model;system-call sequences;tree patterns","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, identifying distributed security solutions to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AMI devices' traffic is an essential requirement that needs to be taken into account. This paper proposes a real-time distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for the AMI infrastructure that utilizes stream data mining techniques and a multi-layer implementation approach. Using unsupervised online clustering techniques, the anomaly-based DIDS monitors the data flow in the AMI and distinguish if there are anomalous traffics.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-7114-0;9781424471140","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society","20030923","2003","","","53","59","We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","χ<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation intrusion detection engine (CIDE) provides power profiling for mobile devices and a correlated view of B-SIPS and snort alerts. An examination of smart battery drain times was conducted to ascertain the optimal transmission rate for the B-SIPS client. A 10 second reporting rate was used to assess 9 device types, which were then compared with their corresponding baseline battery lifetime. Lastly, an extensive usability study was conducted to improve the B-SIPS client and CIDE features.

"A Dynamic Anomaly Detection Scheme for AODV-Based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","H. Nakayama; S. Kurosawa; A. Jamalipour; Y. Nemoto; N. Kato","Grad. Sch. of Inf. Sci., Tohoku Univ., Sendai","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","20090508","2009","58","5","2471","2481","Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are usually formed without any major infrastructure. As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","30","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2136-3;0769521363","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","16","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protection mechanisms such as anomaly-based intrusion detection and application-level IDS, tailored to Web services, are needed to detect Web attacks. The first step in developing Web application IDS is to analyze and categorize possible Web attacks and vulnerabilities.

As a result, it is expected that within a decade, IoE will have an economic value of $14.4 trillion, as the number of devices connected to the Internet continues to increase exponentially. The support for security services in these emerging resource-constrained devices is considered a challenge but needs to take into account from the very early stages of the wireless network inception. This paper proposes a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for IPv6-enabled wireless sensor networks. The proposed IDS is used to detect security attacks based on traffic signatures and abnormal behaviors.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883583","6LoWPAN;IDS;Internet of everything;Internet of things;Intrusion detection system;WSN;Wireless sensor networks","Energy management;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;digital signatures;security of data;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","IPv6-enabled wireless sensor networks;Internet of Everything;IoE;abnormal behaviors;network-based intrusion detection system;policy;quotidian objects;resource-constrained devices;security attack detection;security services;traffic signatures","","1","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
