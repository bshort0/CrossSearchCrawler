Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1;9781467356121","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999). Experiments indicate that AEC can effectively recognize and correlate individual stages of multi-stage attacks, stop incomplete attack stages, and give network administrators meaningful and concise alerts","","0-7695-2564-4;0769525644","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609998","","Aggregates;Bridges;Computer crime;Computer science;Conferences;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bro NIDS;active event correlation;computer attacks;multistage attack detection;network intrusion detection system;security policies","","2","","20","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being based on inspecting snapshots collected over a certain interval, the previous hardwarebased monitoring solutions cannot detect transient attacks that can occur in between snapshots, and cannot protect the kernel against permanent damage. We implemented three prototypes of the Vigilare system by adding Snooper hardware connections module to the host system for bus snooping, and a snapshot-based monitor to be comared with, in order to evaluate the benefit of snoop-based monitoring.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7;9781479981717","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers. We simulate for the propose of validation this algorithm by using OPNET14.0 in terms of false positive and required number of packets to trace DDoS attack traffic source.","2162-9048;21629048","978-1-4244-9222-0;9781424492220","978-1-4244-9223-7;9781424492237","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772420","","Computer crime;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic;Watermarking","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic source;DoS attack;Internet;OPNET14.0;agent packet;alert packet;distributed denial of service;probabilistic packet forwarding;probabilistic route selection algorithm;reply agent packet;source-end detector;spoofed IP addresses;victim-end detector","","0","","7","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","2329-6267;23296267","978-1-4244-3763-4;9781424437634","","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate). We evaluate our approach in terms of performance (live detection) and accuracy based on a data set from our partner, Creos Luxembourg S.A., the electricity grid operator in Luxembourg.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436414","","Context;Monitoring;Network topology;Smart grids;Smart meters;Topology","energy consumption;smart power grids","Creos Luxembourg S.A;advanced software monitoring;alerting system;automated device control;automated meter reading;communication technology;context-dependent consumption;electricity grid;energy consumption;information technology;live machine learning;smart grid;suspicious consumption value detection;suspicious electric consumption detection;two-way communication","","","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727","LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors","Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data","Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring","","0","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%.

Once caught in the honeypot, the blackhat leaves many fingerprints behind: network (information gathering scans, IRC chats, mail, etc) and system activity (what he did on the system, which tools he used, etc). The aim of honeypot forensics is to identify these fingerprints as part of the evidence gathering process. We present a methodology that will help the analyst to achieve this goal. The first step is to analyze the honeypot's ingress and egress network traffic. The second one is to look at the actions performed by the blackhat and the tools he used on the honeypot.

Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded.

Because integration is a key factor influencing cloud deployment, the authors describe several patterns as a basis for enabling enterprise cloud solutions. Building on the integration patterns, the authors propose a method for an initial evaluation of the risk and effort required to move new and existing applications to a cloud service provider by assessing a range of additional factors that influence the complexity of cloud deployment.

So it's very difficult and limited to get the most risky alert through manual process based on the huge network alerts with many attributes. The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times, user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to get the preferable Ranking.

These misbehaviors can be defined by monitoring features belonging to different Android levels. In this paper we present MADAM, a novel host-based malware detection system for Android devices which simultaneously analyzes and correlates features at four levels: kernel, application, user and package, to detect and stop malicious behaviors. MADAM has been designed to take into account those behaviors characteristics of almost every real malware which can be found in the wild. MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4799-3629-8;9781479936298","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","2","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, centralized approaches to IP traffic analysis have scalability problems, which are addressed by replacing existing hardware with more powerful CPUs and faster memory. In contrast, this paper developed and implemented SCRIPT (Scalable Real-time IP Flow Record Analysis), which defines a scalable analysis framework that can be used to distribute flow records to multiple nodes performing traffic analysis in order to balance the overall workload among those nodes.

This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task.

Compared to traditional network, MANETs have unique characteristics such as wireless shared radio medium, limited communication range, highly dynamic topology, power constraints and lack of trusted centralized authority. When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge. In this paper, we briefly introduce routing protocols, examine the behavior of various Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the network layer of MANET and provide comprehensive survey of the existing defense approaches to these attacks.","","978-1-4673-5141-6;9781467351416","","10.1109/INCOSET.2012.6513876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513876","Defense Approaches;MANETs;Network Layer DoS Attacks;Routing Protocols;Security","","","","","1","","49","","","13-14 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876","","Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems","","4","","15","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network conditions like topology, node density, energy constraint makes difficult to decide which protocol suits best for the scenario. The routing in MANETs exploits Proactive and Reactive Routing. Proactive routing provides better packet delivery while Reactive routing has low overheads. Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs. The protocol mainly focuses on trust factor of the node which uses frequency of the node and number of retransmissions from the node.

The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult. To identify denial-of-service vulnerabilities, the authors analyzed two effective sensor network protocols that did not initially consider security.

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach has potential for comparative emotion recognition accuracy when coupled with MLP.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836608","CMAC;EEG;emotion classification;feature extraction;latent features","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","CMAC;EEG signals;KDE;MFCC;MLP classifier;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;PSD;calm emotion;cerebellar model articulation controller;classification performance;computational cerebellar model;data-driven self-organizing feature map;emotion classification;emotion recognition accuracy;fear emotion;feature extraction;happiness emotion;kernel density estimation;multilayer perceptron classifier;power spectrum density;sadness emotion","","0","","28","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","0-7803-8533-0;0780385330","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","10","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries.

""Out-of-the-box"" detection, active defense model, or In-VM models have the same defects: (1) on top of the VMM, two virtual machines are used, one by the user (Guest OS) and the other as monitor (Host OS), and (2) users cannot directly view the detection results nor configure detection system in the Guest OS. A layered detection model is proposed to overcome these issues, the bottom layer is responsible for security for the layers above it. Detection results can be directly displayed in the Guest OS, and users can view and configure the detection system.

The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists.

Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency. However, the effect of change of a cluster tends to change the route; thus degrades the performance. This paper presents a low-overhead clustering algorithm for the benefit of detecting intrusion rather than efficient routing. It also discusses the intrusion detection techniques with the help of this simplified clustering scheme.","","978-0-7803-9442-1;9780780394421","978-0-7803-9442-1;9780780394421","10.1109/SCONEST.2005.4382879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382879","Ad hoc networks;clustering scheme;election process;intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Collaboration;Communication effectiveness;Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;collaborative detection approach;emergency rescue services;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;overhead clustering algorithm;route efficiency;wireless networks","","2","","11","","","27-27 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities.

Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA.

Sensor networks have emerged as a platform for deployment and sustenance of critical applications that require real-time sensing and data acquisition for decision-making purposes. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the issue of computing the optimal parameter values for achieving a reasonable tradeoff between attack detection rate and sensor node energy utilization rate.","1098-7584;10987584","978-1-4244-6919-2;9781424469192","","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584421","","Cognition;Computer networks;Detectors;Equations;Fuzzy logic;Security;Wireless sensor networks","data acquisition;decision making;fuzzy logic;security of data;wireless sensor networks","attack detection rate;communication capability;data acquisition;distributed attack threat;distributed node exhaustion attack decision making;embedded system;fuzzy logic-based approach;optimal parameter values;real-time sensing;sensor node energy utilization;ubiquitous computing;unified and-or fuzzy operator;wireless communications;wireless sensor network","","4","","19","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Classification of computer attacks using a self-organizing map","L. L. DeLooze","","Information Assurance Workshop, 2004. Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","365","369","As computer technology evolves and the threat of computer crimes increases, the apprehension and preemption of such violations become more and more difficult and challenging. To date, it appears that completely preventing breaches of security is unrealistic. Therefore, we must try to detect and classify these intrusions as they occur so that immediate actions may be taken to repair the damage and prevent further harm. One attempt at classifying these intrusions is MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list that provides a common name for all publicly known security weaknesses. The CVE dictionary, however, is not taxonomy. The CVE list is organized in simple numerical order by date of acceptance. Each entry in the dictionary includes a unique CVE identification number, a text description of the vulnerability and any pertinent references. Creating a self-organizing map (SOM) using the text description allows us to order attack profiles with common features in the same general area of the output space. Attacks in the general neighborhood of one another should be able to be mitigated by similar means. Plotting attacks on a SOM also enables us to visually examine the placement of an attack relative to the four common classes of attacks (Denial of Service, Deception, Reconnaissance, and Unauthorized Access). Many attacks have features in common with more than one of these classes rather than corresponding directly to a single class. We have developed an effective technique to classify new attacks using a unique taxonomy, which breaks down threats into the four general categories, and the SOM created by the baseline CVE descriptions.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437840","","Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Dictionaries;Organizing;Reconnaissance;Software standards;Taxonomy;Web pages","authorisation;computer crime;self-organising feature maps","Kohonen map;MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure;computer attack classification;computer crime;computer security;self-organizing map;taxonomy;text description","","1","","7","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low processing power and wireless connectivity make such networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. The dense deployment of sensors along with the protocol deficiencies, make broadcast attacks feasible. The current solutions for these types of attacks are mainly cryptographic and suffer from either heavy computational complexity or lack of mobility support. In this paper we propose an energy efficient method to fortify sensor networks against broadcast attacks using some key features of such networks like small transmission range and low reception-sensitivity. The main idea relies on modifying the reply timings of current MAC sub-layer protocols and embedding a two or three-way handshake protocol in broadcast scenarios so that the adversary receives a negative feedback from the network in response to his greediness in infecting nodes. The simulations confirm the efficiency of this countermeasure applied to the IEEE 802.15.4.","","978-1-4244-2750-5;9781424427505","978-1-4244-2751-2;9781424427512","10.1109/ISTEL.2008.4651270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4651270","Broadcast Attacks;Medium Access Control Protocols;Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Communication system security;Computational complexity;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy efficiency;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;computational complexity;cryptography;personal area networks;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;MAC sublayer protocols;ad hoc networks paradigm;broadcast attacks;computational complexity;cryptography;mobility support;physical environment monitoring;protocol deficiencies;reception-sensitivity;wireless connectivity;wireless sensor network security","","2","","15","","","27-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

Evolutionary approaches play an important role in identifying attacks with high detection rates and low false discovery rates. In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification.
