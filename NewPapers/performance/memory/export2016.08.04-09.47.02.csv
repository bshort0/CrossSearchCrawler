In addition a node doesnpsilat block a compromised node when detects it and only send an alert to the base-station. Then the base-station will check transmission buffer of that node and if the base-station concludes that the node is compromised, the rest of the network will be informed, and the appropriate actions will be taken.

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. Our method is employed to prevent the system with high efficiency and low use of system resources.","","978-1-4673-2981-1;9781467329811","","10.1109/CICN.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375255","Data Stream;Frequent Pattern Mining;Intrusion Prevention","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Intrusion detection;Servers","data mining;security of data","anomaly intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;massive data streams;network security architecture;online frequent item set mining;time-sensitive sliding window","","0","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By adding an extra skip before a match, Sunday-C produces a bigger skip distance for reducing the number of match loops and increasing the match the efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental test of this paper compares the classic algorithm and improved algorithms for matching performance.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps. Other results for a set of 3471 patterns (104399 Byte) with lengths within 21 and 40 characters show an efficiency of 1.87 Byte/Char or 0.42 (6-input LUT/char) and the maximum throughput of 1.97 Gbps.

The network traffic data was collected using WireShark for three days, using the six most common network attributes. The experiment used three association rule data mining techniques known as Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori and FP-Growth based on two, five and ten second window slicing. Out of the four data-sets, data-sets one and two were detected to have anomalies. The results show that the Fuzzy Appriori algorithm presented the best quality result, while FP-Growth presented a faster time to reach a solution. The data-sets, which was pre-processed in the form of two second window slicing displayed better results.

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario.

The existing techniques try to either modify a DFA or a NFA, or combine both these to find a trade off between speed and memory requirements. The idea we propose in this paper is orthogonal to existing techniques. We propose a new approach to store a finite automaton in memory which otherwise is stored as a transition table.

This study presents an incremental network traffic classification algorithm called incremental particle swarm optimisation to enhance the performance of IDS. Based on semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation, the proposed algorithm is composed of two major phases: (i) the classification phase is employed to create the classifier for differentiating the type of network flows from the training dataset and (ii) the clustering phase is then used to classify the newly incoming patterns, which may contain known and unknown network flow types.","2047-4954;20474954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2012.0209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584858","","","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;classification phase;clustering phase;efficient network management method;high-quality network services;incremental network traffic classification algorithm;incremental particle swarm optimisation;intrusion detection system;network management system;semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Smart home is one of the emerging examples for pervasive computing applications. In a smart home scenario, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can potentially provide information about device activities and their status. This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart home sensor network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network. The nature of our proposed solution is generic, so that as it is, or with slight modifications, it can be implemented on other heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.","","978-1-4673-3084-8;9781467330848","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332015","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;mobile Agent;pervasive computing;wireless smart home sensor network","","home computing;mobile agents;security of data;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","CH;IDS;WSHSN;WSN;cluster heads;device activities;home security;intrusion detection systems;memory utilization;mobile agent based anomaly detection;network load reduction;node replacement;node status examination;overall computational cost reduction;pervasive computing applications;suspicious node anomalous behavior;wireless smart home sensor networks","","4","","23","","","4-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Advanced multi-core architectures like the IBM Cell Broadband Engine promise unprecedented performance at a low cost, thanks to their popularity and production volume. Nevertheless, the suitability of the cell processor to string matching has not been investigated so far. In this paper we investigate the performance attainable by the cell processor when employed for string matching algorithms based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA).

However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications.

Several versions of the problem are considered according to the available knowledge about the sources. We compute the security margin for some classes of sources and derive general bounds assuming that the distortion is measured in terms of the mean square error between the original and the attacked sequence.

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we study a joint optimization of MiddleBox Selection and Routing (MBSR) problem with the objective to maximize the throughput for a specified set of sessions in an SDN network. In order to solve this NP-hard problem, we design a polynomial algorithm using the Markov approximation technique.

On the basis of noise character analysis of infrared image, an improved infrared small target detection algorithm is proposed based on energy minimization constrained de-noising technology. Firstly, the image energy model is established, the energy minimization constraint technology is used to make the average output energy of local image area be minimum, and the infrared image noise and clutter signal are suppressed. The directional gradient features of infrared target are extracted, and the potential small targets can be identified with its direction gradient in sequential frames. The multiple frames determination results are obtained, and the fusion result is used to detect the target. Simulation result shows that the algorithm does not need the prediction of background, and it can overcome the interference of cloud in high altitude sky with low SNR, the small target detection accuracy is improved greatly.

In a distributed intrusion detection system, information about the current situation and knowledge about attacks are exchanged, aggregated, fused, and correlated in a cooperative manner to overcome the limitations of conventional centralized intrusion detection systems. However, this distributed approach introduces new challenges such as self-organization and efficient communication techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for developing, simulating, and deploying a distributed intrusion detection system that consists of several collaborating agents. The framework provides a programming interface and comprises all essential communication and synchronization methods that enables self-organized collaboration in a completely distributed manner. In two experiments we demonstrate the performance and capabilities of our implementation by simulating a large-scale worm outbreak and a one-to-many attack. Furthermore, we present two applications of our framework to show how collaboration of agents can be used to detect one-to-many attacks and how detection performance benefits from cooperation of agents.","","978-1-4244-3782-5;9781424437825","978-4-9904-2590-6;9784990425906","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045947","","Application software;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Data acquisition;Data analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems","security of data;software agents;synchronisation","collaborative intrusion detection systems;computer network security;conventional centralized intrusion detection systems;distributed intrusion detection;large-scale simulation;programming interface;self-organized collaboration;synchronization methods","","1","","33","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data. The proposed classification index was evaluated by functionality and security parameters. In overall, the results show that the suggested index has considerable benefits in the process of data classification in cloud computing environments.","","978-1-4799-6105-4;9781479961054","","10.1109/SPC.2014.7086229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086229","Cloud Computing;Cloud Servers;Data Classification;Data Protection;Security","Availability;Cloud computing;Indexes;Process control;Security;Servers","cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy","VDCI;cloud computing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;data privacy;data protection;data security;energy consumption;variable data classification index","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Johnson","","Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","185","190","A parser's job is to take unstructured, opaque data and convert it to a structured, semantically meaningful format. As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0;9780769533360","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trusted domain enforcement of guest OS is improved by interruption and strong isolation provided by VMM. VMM based TDE is achieved by two steps. A non-write protected input for guest domain is detected, notification is sent to VMM. Then, VMM isolates the domain from other domains.

As log files are too enormous to manualize, we develop a tool to maximize accuracy as well as efficiency while high speed processing is the goal. Firstly, we must improve the accuracy by using learning algorithms to classify the normal operations from the abnormal ones such algorithms include tf-idf, association rules, k-means clustering, and decision tree. Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model. Then we flush out out-of-date model while the logs are being captured and processed.

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

The method is based on a goal-oriented framework for generating and resolving obstacles to goal satisfaction. The extended framework addresses malicious obstacles (called anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through anti-goal refinement until leaf nodes are derived that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as countermeasures by application of threat resolution operators to the specification of the anti-requirements and vulnerabilities revealed by the analysis. The paper also introduces formal epistemic specification constructs and patterns that may be used to support a formal derivation and analysis process.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for WSN only focus attention on a specified routing protocol, which lacks universality and flexibility. To solve the problem of multi-protocol intrusion detection, this paper proposes a universal method: MPOID (Multi-Protocol Oriented Intrusion Detection). Our work can generate all the attack types for any routing protocol of WSN, furthermore, part of which can be detected with the automatically generated rules accurately. In this work, we formalize the routing protocol with the Process Algebra for Wireless Mesh Networks (AWN) language, and then classify all the potential attacks into four categories according to four original purposes. Beginning from the original purpose, we can generate all the attack targets, attack traces and attack types. What's more, if the protocol process do not use local variables in the key variable assignment, we can also generatethe detection rules for this attack type. Our case study of ADOV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol shows that our method generated all types of attacks, which outperforms other work. Our further theoretical analysis verifies that our detection rules could detect the corresponding attack types as we claimed. In conclusion, the MPOID method could be used as a flexible and universal tool to analyze and detect attack types for multi-protocol in WSN effectively.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336382","AWN;attack analysis;intrusion detection;multi-protocol;wireless sensor networks","Algebra;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Skeleton;Wireless sensor networks","process algebra;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ADOV protocol;IDS;MPOID;WSN;ad hoc on-demand distance vector protocol;diverse routing protocol;dynamic network topology;key variable assignment;multiprotocol oriented intrusion detection method;process algebra;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor network","","","","30","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.","","","","10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259","IDS;network security;open source","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems","","2","","23","","","11-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first propose rule organized optimal matching (ROOM),which splits the identification rules into several fields and elaborately organizes the matching order of the fields. Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set). Based on ROOM, wefurther propose MP-ROOM, which is extended to well support the rules cross multiple protocol data units (PDUs) fortraffic identification. In addition, we implement a prototype system including MP-ROOM and related work for evaluations.The evaluations show very promising results: 1.5 ~71.3 times throughput improvement is obtained by MP-ROOM inthe real system with less than 300-MB memory consumption.

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","2324-8149;23248149","978-1-61284-295-0;9781612842950","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5;9781424481835","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach provides three algorithms on AC and SBOM, adding, deleting and updating operation, to update state and links of automaton in high-speed online cloud traffic. Theoretical analysis shows that Eagle lowers the computational complexity of updating patterns from O (n<sup>2</sup>) to O (n). The effectiveness of this agile approach is verified when applied to a real cloud gateway. It turns out that 68% - 89% of the time can be saved and the throughput of cloud traffic filtering proves no reduction during and after the pattern update.","","","","10.1109/SOSE.2016.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7473012","cloud intrusion detection system;cloud security;update automaton","Automata;Cloud computing;Computational complexity;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","automata theory;cloud computing;computational complexity;filtering theory;inspection;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Eagle;automaton-based pattern matching;cloud security services;cloud traffic filtering;cloud traffic inspection;computational complexity;multitenant cloud;on-the-fly updating automaton","","","","20","","","March 29 2016-April 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers","D. Guo; L. N. Bhuyan; B. Liu","Microsoft Corporation, Mountain View","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","2","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other well-known machine-learning models used in the same detection task, namely, sequential minimal optimization, deep neural network, C4.5, reduced error pruning tree, and randomTree.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2490802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312964","Botnet intrusion detection;efficient learning;ensembles;feature selection;machine-learning (ML)","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms","computer network security;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","PI-IDS;RDPLM;T-IDS;active attacks;active intrusion;attack signatures;benchmark botnet dataset;botnet intrusion detection;cluster-based partitioning;compact network feature set;critical detection-rate;distributed platform;feature selection techniques;intrusion detection system;multiple randomized meta-learning technique;network traffic;packet encryption;packet header analysis;payload-inspection-based IDS;randomized data partitioned learning model;remotely-controlled compromised machines;subspacing technique;traffic-based IDS;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol packet payload","","","","53","","2015-10-30","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rapid and infrastructure-less deployment in emergency and military situations make these networks unique. However, certain inherently vulnerable characteristics lead to security concerns, which can prove especially damaging in sensitive situations like military operations. Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme and detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation.

As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a NeuroC4.5 based approach to network intrusion detection to detect anomalies in the computer networks. Decision tree is with good comprehensibility while neural network is with strong generalization ability. So, these merits are integrated into a novel decision tree algorithm NeuroC4.5. The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules are more effective because the generalization ability of NeuroC4.5 decision trees is better than that of C4.5 decision trees.
