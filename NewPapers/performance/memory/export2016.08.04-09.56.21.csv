"Demonstration Experiments Towards Practical IP Traceback on the Internet","K. Wakasa; K. Takemori; T. Kai; H. Hazeyama","Japan Data Commun. Assoc., Tokyo, Japan","2010 7th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference","20100225","2010","","","1","5","Recently, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become a critical issue on the Internet. Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-5175-3;9781424451753","978-1-4244-5176-0;9781424451760","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues.

These approaches are complicated, costly, and present their own vulnerabilities. In this paper, we describe new secure software technology that enables users to transparently add memory encryption to their existing software, without requiring users to invest in costly encryption hardware or requiring programmers to undertake complicated software redesign/redeployment. The memory encryption and transparent aegis library (METAL) functions as a shim library, allowing legacy applications to transparently enjoy an assurance of memory confidentiality and integrity.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Denial of service (DoS) attacks cause significant disruptions to the Internet, compounding the delay jitter and loss of packets that are used to transmit sensor measurements and control signals. Existing works have mainly focused on controller design under network normal operation, which might be inadequate to the threats of DoS attacks. In this paper, the authors present two mitigation measures from the viewpoint of network intrusion detection and response. The basic idea is that the routers close to the attack sources actively drop the attack traffic or lower-priority traffic to protect the resource for the legitimate application traffic. The simulation results indicate that the proposed defense measures are effective for ameliorating the NBCS performance degradation. We suggest that a plausible direction for the security of NBCS may combine the proposed network defense measures with specific controller design to compensate for delay jitter/packet loss.","","0-7803-8730-9;0780387309","","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432165","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;Jitter;Loss measurement;Niobium compounds;Stochastic systems;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;control system synthesis;delays;jitter;microcontrollers;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;control signal transmission;delay jitter;denial of service attack;mitigating performance;network defense;network intrusion detection;network router;network traffic;network-based control system security;sensor measurement;stochastic delay","","1","","11","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead. Therefore, we propose a utility based QoE monitoring approach based on statistical losses at the application layer.

The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance. We also discuss the effects of the reloading of splitting policies on packet duplication rate and on the load on the sensors.","","0-7803-8325-7;0780383257","","10.1109/INCC.2004.1366575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366575","","Adaptive systems;Educational institutions;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Scalability;Sensor systems;Statistics;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;SNORT intrusion detection system;adaptive load balancing architecture;load disparity;management console;multi sensor intrusion detection systems;packet duplication rate minimization;traffic splitting policies","","0","","8","","","11-13 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The KDD99 dataset is a benchmark dataset that is used in various researches while our network dataset is an online network data captured in actual network environment.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight detection approach for the unauthorized reading without affecting the operation of RFID systems. Such an approach contains three parts: RF signal scanner, signalevent model construction and abnormal feature extraction. In particular, we design and implement a RF scanner to acquire RF signals and measure RSSI values. After that, we build a signal-event model to analyze how the RSSI value is related to the RFID event. The detection of unauthorized reading is to investigate the deviation of observed RSSI values from their expected values. Finally, we extract and separate abnormal RSSI values to estimate the risk of unauthorized reading. The primary experimental results show that our approach can achieve high prediction accuracy in detecting unauthorized reading and make better performance in extracting abnormal features.","","","","10.1109/CSCloud.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371501","abnormal features;scanner;signal-event model;unauthorized reading","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Training","RSSI;feature extraction;radiofrequency identification","RF signal scanner;RFID tag;RFID unauthorized reading;RSSI value;feature extraction;lightweight detection approach;radiofrequency identification;signal event model construction","","","","22","","","3-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Live migration is an essential feature of virtualization that allows transition of a running virtual machine from one system to another without halting the virtual machine. Live migration extends the list of benefits server virtualization provides. Almost all virtualization softwares now include support for live migration of virtual machine. Live migration is in its infant stage where security of live migration is yet to be analyzed. The usages of live migration and security exploits over it have both increased over time. The security concern of live migration is a major factor for its adoption by the IT industry.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data plane forwarding in network routers has traditionally been implemented with custom-logic hardware, but recent router designs increasingly use software-programmable network processors for packet forwarding. These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","7","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To tackle this problem, we propose genetic algorithms (GAs) based clustering method, which dynamically adjusts the fuzzy sets to provide maximum profit based on minimum support and confidence specified as linguistic terms. This is achieved by tuning the base values of the membership functions for each quantitative attribute in a way that maximizes the number of large itemsets.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters.

However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware.

Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant.

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.","","978-1-4244-7530-8;9781424475308","","10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840","SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware","Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","message authentication","IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication","","1","","16","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an extension of Grid Computing and Distributed Computing, CC aims to provide users with flexible services in a transparent manner. The distributed implementation of CC creates a suitable environment for easy targets, vulnerable and prone to sophisticated attacks. Commonly virtualization is the most utilized technology to implement a Cloud environment with a massive multi-tenancy usage, opening a door to a whole other level of security issues. This creates new targets for intrusion due to the complexity of access and difficulty in monitoring all interconnection points between systems, applications, and data sets. This raises many questions about the appropriate infrastructure, processes, and strategy for enacting detection and response to intrusion in a Cloud environment.

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","16","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software applications frequently fail to identify so many signatures through comparisons at very high network speeds. Bloom filters are one of the main multi-hashing schemes utilized in hardware to support this level of security. Nevertheless Bloom filters consume significant power to store, retrieve and lookup virus signatures owing to many hash function computations required to index to the memory. We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware. The theoretical analysis has shown that power gain achieved through new lookup technique can go up to 90%.

This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention.

Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","","978-1-4244-9127-8;9781424491278","978-1-4503-0379-8;9781450303798","10.1145/1872007.1872032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623834","Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection System;Pre-Filter;Range Hash;Range Matching;Regular Expressions","Complexity theory;Computer aided manufacturing;Data structures;Detectors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Throughput","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","FPGA chips;Internet carriers;Internet traffic demands;Snort signature;character classes;data centers;deep packet inspection;exact strings;high-speed backbone network testing;network intrusions;range hash architecture;regular expression detection;regular expression prefiltering;repetition matching","","2","","45","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network traffic dataset have many features and all may not contribute in detection of threats. Rejecting irrelevant features may increase performance of IDS by reducing computational time. In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naïve Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717881","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Security","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;security of data;storage management","IT-Infrastructure;SAL platform;SIEM platform;application logs;central interface;central storage;computing resources;correlation algorithms;correlation tasks;event clustering;event correlation module;high performance security analytics;in-memory data management technique;k-means algorithm;management methods;multicore architecture;next generation security information and event management platform];real-time event information;real-time events;security analytics lab;security event correlation;system logs","","0","","8","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6;9781479979806","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8;9781457714498","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786","IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines","Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine","","3","","19","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2321-2;9781479923212","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of works which aim to protect these components generally consist in developing protections (or countermeasures) taken one by one. But this ""countermeasure-centered"" approach drastically decreases the performances of the whole chip in terms of power and speed. Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures.

The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor.

As to management of network security, we give security management requirements for large computer networks, combined with our management experience of managing CERNET. From our experience, the widely used firewalls in the Internet are lacking in the capability to be remotely managed on a large scale, especially multi-vendor network environment. Addressing these problems, the concept of high level security policy management is proposed for large networks. To support high level policy management and collaborative management of multi-vendor firewalls, a definition for a common firewall MIB (CFWMIB) and a common format for the TRAP events record are proposed. For the aspect of security of network management, we present a security architecture which is implemented in our web-based network management system. Flexible authentication and role-based access control mechanisms of the architecture are described.

Zebu-based applications are efficient, since message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Zebu-based applications are also robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation of the message structure.

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable. In this context, we coin the term biochemical cryptography that might lead to significant improvements in the field of molecular communication.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners, mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur.

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones.

Fault tolerance is a key mechanism by which survivability can be achieved in these information systems. Much of the literature on fault-tolerant distributed systems focuses on local error recovery by masking the effects of faults. We describe a direction for error recovery in the face of catastrophic faults, where the effects of the faults cannot be masked using available resources. The goal is to provide continued service that is either an alternate or degraded service by reconfiguring the system rather than masking faults.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"". To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","17","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Historically, tracing individual packets by keeping packet logs at each router has required prohibitive amounts of memory; one of SPIE's key innovations is to reduce the memory requirement (down to 0.5% of link capacity) by storing only packet digests, that is, hashes of the packets rather than the packet itself. SPIE-enhanced routers maintain a cache of packet digests for recently forwarded traffic. If a packet is determined to be offensive by an intrusion detection system (or judged interesting by some other metric), a query is dispatched to the SPIE system that, in turn, queries routers for packet digests of the relevant time periods. ne results of this query are used in a simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm to build a highly reliable and accurate attack graph that identifies the packet's source or sources.","","0-7695-1897-4;0769518974","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194937","","Computer crime;Data structures;Dissolved gas analysis;Engines;Floods;History;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;TCPIP;Technological innovation","security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","SPIE;Source Path Isolation Engine;attack graph;cache;forwarded traffic;hashes;intrusion detection system;memory requirement;packet digests;query;routers;simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm;single IP packet traceback;tap boxes","","0","","","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack.

Rowe","U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, USA","Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops, 2007, AINAW '07. 21st International Conference on","20070827","2007","1","","563","568","We explore a new approach to defense of computer systems, deliberately deceiving attackers as to resource availability. This can be more effective than outright denial of access because it encourages an attacker to waste time continuing their attack. But effective deceptions must be consistent to convince an adversary. We are exploring automated methods for maintaining logical consistency by tracking assertions made so far with associated causal and other indirect implications. We have built a deception planner that takes as input as sequence of operating-system commands and finds the possible consistent deceptions as per our logical constraints, and rates the deceptions using several criteria. In a test on a generic planning model of rootkit installation, it found 72 of 558 possible deceptions were acceptable and rated them.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221117","","Access control;Availability;Impedance;Internet;Invasive software;Military computing;Protection;Psychology;Testing;Waste materials","authorisation;operating systems (computers);resource allocation","access denial system;computer system defense;cyberspace;logically consistent resource-deception plan;operating system command;resource availability","","0","","22","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
