Outlier detection in very large data sets is however computationally very demanding and currently requires highperformance computing facilities.

In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the security features of GUIDEX against free riders, dishonest insiders and DoS attacks.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.121214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354280","Intrusion detection systems;collaborative networks;game theory;incentive compatibility;network optimization;network security and economics","Communication networks;Computer crime;Computer security;Economics;Intrusion detection;Security;Telecommunication services","Internet;computer network security;game theory","DoS attacks;GUIDEX IDN system;IDS peers;Nash equilibrium;collaborative IDS network;detection knowledge;discrete event simulation;dishonest insiders;free riders;game-theoretic incentive-based mechanism;game-theoretic modeling;intrusion assessment;intrusion detection networks;intrusion detection systems;iterative algorithm;resource management component;security features;trust management","","3","","33","","","December 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2210217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6248214","Computer security;checkpointing;information security;intrusion detection;operating systems;system recovery;virtual machine monitors","Couplings;Forensics;Monitoring;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","computer forensics;data privacy","computer systems;data access;data exfiltration attempts;data provenance;forensic analysis;forensic layer records;forensic platform;hypervisor;multiple disks;privacy breaches;tracking mechanism;version-based audit log;virtualized environment","","0","","37","","2012-07-24","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, fluctuations for first octet aggregation lead to similar pattern compared to that of first and second octets aggregation.

Since 1990 this system has been operational, monitoring a variety of network systems and services. We call it the Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter, or NADIR.

This new component is called the UNICOS Real-time NADIR, or UNICORN. UNICORN summarizes user activity and system configuration information in statistical profiles. In near real-time, it can compare current activity to historical profiles and test activity against expert rules that express our security policy and define improper or suspicious behavior. It reports suspicious behavior to security auditors and provides tools to aid in follow-up investigations.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4;9781467327084","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unique to our approach is the use of diverse process pairs not only for isolation benefits but also for detection. The architecture uses the comparison of outputs from diverse applications to provide a significant and novel intrusion detection capability. With this technique, we gain the benefits of n-version programming without its controversial disadvantages. The isolation of intrusions is mainly achieved with an out-of-band control system that separates the primary and backup system.

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","20030521","2003","","","44","61","A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-1940-7;0769519407","","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327","","Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic","","26","30","20","","","11-14 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions.

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7;9781849199407","","10.1049/cp.2014.0975","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function.

TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","14","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack).

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores.

Reconfigurable Wireless Networks has an ability to reconstruct its networks if network crash takes place and ZRP follow, highly mobile environment and it helps to enhance capabilities of proactive protocol routing protocols and because of increase in the search of route per time for same route or different latency decreases of reactive protocol.

These insider threats make use of internal network flaws as the loop holes and are the root cause for data exfiltration and infiltration (Data leakage). Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern.

While it started with data centers and battery-operated mobile devices, it has recently branched to core network devices such as routers. However, this emerging need for low-power system design has not been studied for security systems, which are becoming increasingly important today. Toward this direction, we aim to reduce the power consumption of network-level intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are used to improve the secure operation of modern computer networks. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to low-power system design, such as frequency scaling, lead to a disproportionate increase in packet processing and queuing times. In this paper, we show that this increase has a negative impact on the detection latency and impedes a timely reaction. To address this issue, we present a low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS (LEoNIDS): an architecture that resolves the energy-latency tradeoff by providing both low power consumption and low detection latency at the same time. The key idea is to identify the packets that are more likely to carry an attack and give them higher priority so as to achieve low attack detection latency. Our results indicate that LEoNIDS consumes power comparable to a state-of-the-art low-power design, while, at the same time, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster attack detection.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2369958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977945","Energy-Efficient Systems;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion detection systems;Low Latency;Low-Power design;Multi-Core Packet Processing;Network Security;Performance;energy-efficient systems;low latency;low-power design;multi-core packet processing;network security;performance","Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Program processors;Security;Time-frequency analysis","computer network security;energy conservation;low-power electronics;power aware computing;power consumption","LEoNIDS;battery-operated mobile devices;core network devices;data centers;frequency scaling;low attack detection latency;low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS;low-latency and energy-efficient network-level intrusion detection system;low-power system design;modern computer networks;packet processing;power consumption;queuing times;routers;secure operation;security systems","","0","","30","","2014-12-05","Jan.-March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While deterministic automata provide the best performance, previous research has shown that such automata can be exponential in the size and/or number of rules. Nondeterministic automata can avoid size explosion, but their matching time can increase quickly with the number of rules. In contrast, we present a new technique that constructs polynomial size automata. Moreover, we show that the matching time of our automata is insensitive to the number of rules. The key idea in our approach is that of decomposing and reordering the tests on packet header fields so that the result of performing a test can be utilized on behalf of many rules.

As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for a Storage Area Network (SAN) is to provide data integrity and confidentiality. In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers. This allows our scheme to be scalable and be free from any single point of failure or attack.","","0-7695-1888-5;0769518885","","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183514","","Availability;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Power system security;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks;Web server","cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;network operating systems","SAN entities;cryptographic processing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;group key agreement;group key mechanisms;reliability;scalability;scalable data sharing;storage area networks;strong cryptographic techniques","","3","1","30","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Success of these applications is dependent on end user trust, although these services have serious weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers. Application owners must take additional steps to ensure the security of customer data and integrity of the applications, since web applications are under siege from cyber criminals seeking to steal confidential information and disable or damage the services offered by these applications. Successful attacks have lead to some organizations experiencing financial difficulties or even being forced out of business. Organizations have insufficient tools to detect and respond to attacks on web applications, since traditional security logs have gaps that make attack reconstruction nearly impossible.

Experimental results have shown that the PCC lightweight anomaly detection classifier outperforms other existing anomaly detection algorithms such as the KNN and LOF classifiers. In order to assess the performance of the PCC classifier on a real network environment, the relative assumption model together with feature extraction techniques are used to generate normal and anomalous traffic in a LAN testbed. Finally, scalability and response performance of the proposed system are investigated through the simulation of the proposed communication architecture.

The BDI (belief-desire-intention) model is a well studied architecture of agency for intelligent agents situated in complex and dynamic environments. Traditional MAS-based distributed IDSs commonly do their detection work within a framework that employs the method of distributed data collection and hierarchical data analysis. This is a simple and strict method, but it restricts the characteristic of distributing, intelligence and real-time response badly. In this paper, we present a dynamically-created hierarchical framework, and then bring forward the basic algorithm system to support it.

First, original training dataset gained from network is divided into three subsets according to the network protocol (TCP, UDP and ICMP). Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set.
