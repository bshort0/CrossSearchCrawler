In deep packet inspection, the contents of network traffic are matched against patterns of malicious traffic to identify attack-carrying packets. The pattern matching algorithms employed for deep packet inspection must be fast, as the algorithms are often implemented on middle-boxes residing on high-speed gigabits per second links. The majority of patterns employed in network security applications are regular languages. However, regular language-based patterns have limited expressive power and are not capable of describing some complex features in network payload. Back reference is an important feature provided by many pattern matching tools, e.g., PCRE, the regular expression libraries of Java, Perl, and Python. Back references are used to identify repeated patterns in input strings. Patterns containing back-references are non-regular languages. Very little work has been done to improve the time-efficiency of back reference-based pattern matching. The de facto algorithm to implement back reference is recursive backtracking, but it is vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement back references. The basic idea of our approach is to transform a back reference problem to a conditional submatch problem, and represent it with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)-like machine subject to some constraints. Our experimental results show that our approach resists known algorithmic complexity attacks, and is faster than PCRE by up to three orders of magnitude for certain types of patterns.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410264","Back reference;Finite automaton;Network-based Intrusion Detection System;Pattern matching","Resists","finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;security of data","NFA-like machine;back reference-based pattern matching algorithm;conditional submatch problem;de facto algorithm;firewalls;modern network security applications;network-based intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automata like machine;recursive backtracking;regular language-based patterns","","","","28","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2;9781424480012","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy. As a result of finding imperfect self-region radius we have faced weak detectors that couldn't recognize anomaly perfectly.

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4;9781424492114","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions. Each algorithm discovers those substructures that match the closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly.","","978-0-7695-3568-5;9780769535685","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804450","","Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching;Personnel;Terrorism","graph theory;pattern matching;security of data","insider threat detection;labeled graph-based anomaly detection system;labeled vertex;minimum description length principle;normative pattern matching;unauthorized access identification","","4","","8","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links.

However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","2","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BOPS implementation allows pluggable components to replace existing components functionality, accepting integration into current operating environments in a short period of time. The BOPS implementation provides continuous protection to the resources and assurance of the placement and viability of adjudication and other key features. Accountability is the mechanism that proves a service-level guarantee of security. The BOPS implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface. The BOPS implementation need not know whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The BOPS implementation functionality offers a point-and-cut mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security to provide the communication interface. The architecture is built on the servlet specification, open SSLs, Java, JSON, REST, and an open persistent store.

Our work is motivated by the intrusion detection paradigm, but is an attempt to avoid ad hoc approaches to codifying misuse behavior. Our approach is based on the observation that although privileged programs can be exploited (due to errors) to cause security compromises in systems because of the privileges accorded to them, the intended behavior of privileged programs is, of course, limited and benign. The key, then, is to specify the intended behavior (i.e. the program policy) and to detect any action by a privileged program that is outside the intended behavior and that imperils security. We describe a program policy specification language, which is based on simple predicate logic and regular expressions. In addition, we present specifications of privileged programs in Unix, and a prototype execution monitor for analyzing audit trails with respect to these specifications. The program policies are surprisingly concise and clear, and in addition, capable of detecting exploitations of known vulnerabilities in these programs. Although our work has been motivated by the known vulnerabilities in Unix, we believe that by tightly restricting the behavior of all privileged programs, exploitations of unknown vulnerabilities can be detected.

One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users’ private lives. In addition, this might enable pervasive observation or imitation of one’s movements and activities, such as sending messages to contacts, accessing private communication, shopping with a credit card, and relaying information about where one has been.

Bersey","","2016 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC)","20160721","2016","","","35","42","The progressive integration of software-based components into the electricity grid has given raise to what is known as Smart Grids. As long as Smart Grids gain on connectivity and automation, new concerns on their safety and security have arisen. It is agreed that non-negligible risks and enlarged impact due to misbehaviors and intrusions exist. Following a model driven paradigm, a method is proposed to reinforce the security of these complex widely distributed systems. The method guides system re-engineering and is based upon timed models. It encompasses reverse engineering, symbolic, and testing techniques to model, analyze, and deploy attack testing. In early stages of the method, a reference timed model to support security analyses is designed via reverse engineering and symbolic execution. During latter stages, the nominal models are enriched so as to specify attack scenarios which are symbolically executed to prove the ability of the system to detect attacker intrusions. In final stages, the attack scenarios are used to specify test cases which are later deployed to test the system. The method and main outcomes are presented relying upon a Smart Grid subsystem analyzed in the scope of a joint academy-industry project.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515609","model driven re-engineering;model-based testing;reverse engineering for modeling;security testing;smart grids;symbolic analysis;timed UML model","Analytical models;Monitoring;Registers;Reverse engineering;Safety;Security;Smart grids","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows that this lack of state information requires an additional metric (The exchange timeout window) for detection of WLAN Denial of Service Probe Flood attacks. Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks. A parameter selection method is proposed which is shown to provide reliability and repeatability in attack detection in WLANs.

This paper presents the design and implementation of VAOFS, a Verifiable Append-Only File System for regulatory compliance. Verifiability is provided by a tamper resistant hardware device cooperating with an instrumented file system. Non-appending operations can be detected in an audit process.

By handling the timing and integration of the regular expression-based rules in a custom microcontroller, the memory costs are reduced and the capabilities are increased over a DFA-only solution. Both the microcontroller and its associated DFA are implemented on the FPGA. The patterns and software are stored using run-time programmable memory tables.

We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities.

To squeeze the best out of network capabilities, there is need for algorithms for optimal placement of the security functionality in the cloud infrastructure. However, due to the large number of flows to be considered and complexity of interactions in these networks, the classical placement algorithms are not scalable. To address this issue, we elaborate an optimization framework, namely OCDO, that provides adequate and scalable network security provisioning and deployment in the cloud. Our approach is based on an innovative multistage approach that combines together decomposition and segmentation techniques to the problem of security functions placement while coping with the complexity and the scalability of such an optimization problem.

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes.

Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and may act freely as web clients or servers. Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT. The partial evaluation results show that the proposed protocol, named compressed and distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is more adapted than the standard HIP, while introducing minor header communication overhead.","2327-6525;23276525","978-1-4799-6608-0;9781479966080","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990267","6LoWPAN compression;Host Identity Protocol;Internet of Tinhgs;IoT;Wireless Sensor Networks;distributed HIP Base Exchange;end-to-end security","Hip;IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;file servers;personal area networks;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN;CD-HIP;IP-based security protocols;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;Web clients;Web servers;communication overhead;compressed and distributed HIP;computational-load distribution techniques;distribution scheme;end-to-end security;host identity protocol;messages compression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network Processors (NPs), a specialized multiprocessor, can provide flexibility and high performance for string matching. This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets.","2161-5322;21615322","978-1-4244-1967-8;9781424419678","978-1-4244-1968-5;9781424419685","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493512","","Analytical models;Automata;Computational modeling;Costs;Heart;Internet;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Throughput","security of data;string matching","Internet;analytical performance model;intrusion detection systems;network processors;string matching algorithms","","1","","21","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","","978-1-4244-2682-9;9781424426829","978-1-4244-2683-6;9781424426836","10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625475","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Coprocessors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Impedance matching;Information security;Inspection;Pattern matching","computer architecture;coprocessors;logic gates","AND-logic;AND-logic regular expressions;RAM data;Virtex2 devices;Virtex4 devices;content inspection;dot-star;hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture;packet inspection coprocessor;pattern matching;software algorithms","","1","","26","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improvement allows us to apply complex QoS algorithms whose implementation is quite difficult if the number of connections to follow is high.","1550-3607;15503607","0-7803-8938-7;0780389387","","10.1109/ICC.2005.1494374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1494374","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Data analysis;Data communication;Information analysis;Probes;Quality of service;Sensor systems;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;accounting;data communication;multiprocessing systems;quality of service;sensors;statistics;telecommunication traffic","Internet;accounting;complex QoS strategies;data communication;high performance multiprocessor architecture;information interchange;intrusion detection;network traffic;passive analysis;quality of service statistics;sensors","","0","","17","","","16-20 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy. Simulation results manifest that the proposed schemes offer significant energy efficiency and highlight their flexibility.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2217387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296725","Channel awareness;energy efficiency;opportunistic transmission scheduling;optimal stopping","Data communication;Energy consumption;Minimization;Quality of service;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer power supplies;energy consumption;minimisation;stochastic processes;wireless channels","battery lifetime;channel-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling;communication energy consumption;data transmission;distributed scheduler;energy efficiency;energy-efficient wireless link;minimization approach;optimal stopping theory;power level;stochastic characteristic;terminal device;time scheduling strategy;transmission energy consumption;transmission power consumption;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless device","","9","","32","","2012-09-06","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To implement a reasonable control strategy, a minimal set of routers is computed in a network that can be used to control and reduce damage done by a large-scale attack such as worm or DDOS attacks. Our work focuses on large network while previous works focus on LANs. We proposed rules to choose these routers based on the network topology and based on risk assessment. Many topological factors are considered into the control strategy process, the control router sets selecting algorithm based on entropy was put forward. According to the incidents distribution on the topology, the factor of macroscopic epidemic status is proposed by the method of quantitative and qualitative analysis, which offers administrators the direct decisive advice to prevent network security event from overspreading and minimize the costs. At last, the experiment effectively proved the evaluation framework and the control algorithm.","","978-1-4244-6754-9;9781424467549","","10.1109/ICICSE.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521608","Control strategy;Emergency response;Entropy;Network security","Communication system control;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer worms;Electronic mail;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Process control","computer network security;entropy;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","control router set selecting algorithm;control strategy generation;entropy;large-scale network attack;macroscopic epidemic status;network damage assessment;network security;network topology;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;topology awareness","","0","","9","","","21-22 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Xv6 runs as trusted OS for executing the monitoring service that detects the violation of the integrity of the Linux kernel while Linux as a general purpose OS. The monitoring service checks whether Linux is compromised or not. A secure pager that offers the spatial isolation based on the core-local memory is proposed to protect the integrity of the xv6 kernel located in the main memory, which can make Linux and xv6 run in high security level.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029887","embedded system;security;virtualization","Embedded systems;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Random access memory;Security;Virtual machine monitors","Linux;multiprocessing systems;security of data","SPUMONE;core-local memory;embedded Linux;embedded systems;multicore processor;security requirements;virtualization layer","","2","","10","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","","","","10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982526","Intrusion Detection;SVM and Bat Algorithm","Accuracy;Barium;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines","feature selection;feedforward neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","Bat algorithm;NIDS model;NSL-KDD data;PSO-SVM;feature selection;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection systems;optimization;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","27","","","17-19 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","A. Nogueira; P. Salvador; F.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0;9781424472710","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
