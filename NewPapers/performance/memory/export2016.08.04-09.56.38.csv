Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks.

Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles. These technical components take fundamentally different approaches from traditional empirical or statistical methods and are designed based on rigorous computational analysis with mathematically proven performance guarantee.

The behavior based monitoring is used to avoid the polymorphic malicious code. Signature based detection system or fixing these vulnerabilities are not the efficient method. Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user. It introduces an average eight percent computation overhead into the system.","","978-1-4673-2756-5;9781467327565","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450586","Malicious code;Native API;Scrambling","Browsers;Computers;Educational institutions;Kernel;Monitoring;Registers","application program interfaces;security of data","behavior based monitoring;high level system API;kernel mode;local ID;malicious code prevention;polymorphic malicious code;remote ID;security scheme;signature based detection system;system service caller;window system","","0","","11","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

However, one of the most significant challenges in this area is the poor detection rate, due to the presence of excessive features in a data set whose class distributions are imbalanced. Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

It is based on computing the sum of character's values in the search string and comparing this sum with the sum of the values of the corresponding characters in the sliding window.

The primary challenge for enabling reliable array operation with such aggressive cell is presented, namely, severely degraded sensing margin due to significantly lower ON/OFF ratio of resistive memories (~10<sup>2</sup> for PCM) than that of traditional MOSFETs (>10<sup>5</sup> ). To address this challenge, two enabling techniques were developed and implemented in hardware: 1) two-bit encoding and 2) a clocked self-referenced sensing scheme (CSRSS). In addition, the two-bit encoding can also improve algorithmic mapping by effectively compressing TCAM entries.

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.","2160-4886;21604886","0-7803-9181-0;0780391810","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks. In this paper we focus specifically on the design decisions made during the VisFlowConnect development process so that others may learn from our experience. The current VisFlowConnect architecture - the result of these design decisions - is extensible to processing other high-volume multi-dimensional data streams where link connectivity/activity is a focus of study.

We propose the segmented regex-NFA (SR-NFA) architecture, where the regex is first compiled into modular nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), then partitioned, optimized, and matched efficiently on modern multi-core processors. SR-NFA offers attack-resilient multi-gigabit per second matching throughput, does not suffer from either backtracking or state explosion, and can be rapidly constructed. For regex sets that construct a DFA with moderate state explosion, i.e., on average 200k states in the STT, the proposed SR-NFA is 367k times faster to construct and update and use 23k times less memory than the DFA approach.

This IDS can correlate the information received from the local systems, as well as monitoring data from the Grid System, using statistical methods, to identify attacks that cannot be detected at a local level.

"An Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection Scheme for Hierarchical WSNs","A. Al-Riyami; N. Zhang; J. Keane","School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.","IEEE Access","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Node compromise attacks pose a serious threat to WSNs. To launch an attack, an adversary physically captures a node and access data or software stored on the node. Even worse, the adversary may redeploy the captured node back into the network and use it to launch further attacks. To reduce the impact of a node compromise attack on network operations, the network should detect a node compromise as early as possible, ideally soon after a node is being captured, and then isolate the node from future network communications. Solutions for early node compromise detection are based on distributed monitoring of neighbouring nodes’ aliveness. Nodes regularly send notification (Heartbeat) messages to their one-hop neighbors to indicate their aliveness. If no message is received from a node (i.e., if a node is not heard) for a certain period of time, then the unheard node is said to have been compromised. This approach may have a large number of false positive errors when the message loss ratio in the network is high, as missing messages could be caused by message loss during transmission, in addition to node compromises. This paper proposes a novel scheme, called an Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection (AdaptENCD) scheme, to facilitate node compromise attack detection in a cluster-based WSN. The scheme is designed to achieve a low false positive ratio in the presence of various levels of message loss ratios. To achieve this feature, two ideas are used in the design. The first is to use cluster-based collective decision making to detect node compromises. The second is to dynamically adjust the rate of notification message transmissions in response to the message loss ratio in the sender’s neighborhood. The performance of the scheme, in terms of false positive ratio, false negative ratio and transmission overheads, is evaluated using simulation. The results are compared against those from the most relevant scheme in the literature. The comparison results show- that our scheme can detect all the node compromises in the network more effectively and efficiently, regardless of the message loss ratio in the underlying environment.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2594478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530851","Node compromise attack;Wireless Sensor Networks;adaptive;detection","Adaptation models;Network security;Propagation losses;Telecommunication network management;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","2016-08-03","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries. In this article we propose a novel approach to fully exploit the DMA-based communication mechanisms of the Cell/B.E. to provide an unprecedented level of aggregate performance with irregular access patterns. We have discovered that memory congestion plays a crucial role in determining the performance of this algorithm. We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance.

These digital documents are the most important asset of an organization and are hence the chief target of insider abuse. Security policies provide the first step to prevent abuse by defining proper and improper usage of resources. Coarse grained security policies that operate on the ""principle of least privilege"" [J. H. Saltzer et al., (1974)] alone are not enough to address the insider threat, since the typical insider possesses a wide range of privileges to start with. In this paper, we propose a security policy that is tailored to prevent insider abuse. We define the concept of subject, object, actions, rights, context and information flow as applicable to the document control domain. Access is allowed based on the principles of ""least privilege and minimum requirements"", subject to certain constraints. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed policy engine considers, among other factors, the context of a document request and the information flow between such requests to identify potential malicious insiders. Enforcing these fine-grained access control policies gives us a better platform to prevent the insider abuse. Finally, for demonstration purposes, we present a framework that can be used to specify and enforce these policies on Microsoft Word documents, one of the popular document formats.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377237","Access Control;Digital Documents;Information Flow;Insider Threat","Access control;Collaboration;Computer hacking;Computer security;Contracts;Cryptography;Humans;Information management;Protection;Research and development","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;document handling","Microsoft Word document;access control;digital document;document control domain;information flow;insider threat;least privilege minimum requirement;online technology;security policy","","11","1","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable.

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) is produced to solve the abovementioned problems. Applying mobile agent (MA) to the intrusion detection is a recent development and it is aimed at effective intrusion detection in distributed environment. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. Although the mobile agent improves the design, construction, and implementation significantly, it does not provide detection algorithm for its intrusion detection.

Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","0","5","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably.

The nodes are deployed randomly over an area in order to sense various physical phenomena related parameters. The nodes sense the data within their vicinity and forward the data to the neighboring nodes so as to forward the data towards the base station. However, there may be few malicious nodes present in the network and these nodes falsify the data while communicating. This results in false information gathered by the base station and also exhausting the energy of the nodes in the path. Due to the presence of these untrusted nodes the security of the WSN application is compromised as the false data results in distorted information. So it is necessary to study a trust model, various security threats and their effect on WSN. Trust is essential among the nodes in the WSN so that the data can be forwarded without being modified or distorted. This work examines malicious node attack in the WSN scenario and the energy consumption. In this work TRMsim-WSN simulator has been made use of to model the trust and various security attacks and energy consumption analysis with respective to client nodes, relay nodes and malicious nodes has been carried out.","","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7457012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457012","WSN;malicious;security;trust","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","WSN application;base station;malicious nodes;neighboring nodes;security threats;tiny nodes;trust model;wireless sensor network","","","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of ""soft IP cores,"" often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892","Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization","Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation","NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks","","0","","37","","2015-07-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants.

The purpose of this conceptual metamodel is to express causal behavior and compositions of causal behavior in a model which integrates all observable operational features of a system into one behavior specification. This conceptual metamodel is useful for analyzing systems, for constructing particular system behavior models, and for using those models in the specification, design, and evaluation of engineered systems. It provides the necessary semantic elements for describing general hardware/software systems, including hardware-only, software-only, or mixed system components, and it allows these different types of components to be treated in a consistent manner, providing a basis for representing a wide variety of systems.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4665016","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

The problem that this paper addresses is that there is no harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model with appropriate implementation guidelines and, thus, there is a lack of an effective and standardised implementation of digital forensic investigation readiness measures within organisations. Valjarevic and Venter have, in their previous work, proposed a harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model. This paper proposes implementation guidelines for such a harmonised digital forensic investigation process model in order to help practitioners and researchers to successfully implement the proposed model.

In this paper, we describe a proof-of-concept server backdoor which hides the in- and exfiltration of data in incoming and outgoing benign traffic of the victim server. Using a low-traffic system call proxy, our backdoor allows the remote execution of arbitrary programs on the victim server without being detectable by network intrusion detection systems.

In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.","","978-1-4673-2067-2;9781467320672","","10.1109/SERE.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258304","energy model;power usage measurements;smart handheld devices","Brightness;Discharges (electric);Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Power demand;Power measurement","","","","17","","20","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the problem has received some attention from the research community, little is known about the tradeoffs among different objectives, e.g. network performance, power consumption, delay in information being collected and security effectiveness. This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4577-0637-0;9781457706370","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Eagle: User profile-based anomaly detection for securing Hadoop clusters","C. Gupta; R. Sinha; Y. Zhang","eBay Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","Big Data (Big Data), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20151228","2015","","","1336","1343","Existing Big data analytics platforms, such as Hadoop, lack support for user activity monitoring. Several diagnostic tools such as Ganglia, Ambari, and Cloudera Manager are available to monitor health of a cluster, however, they do not provide algorithms to detect security threats or perform user activity monitoring. Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable system that can detect malicious user activities, especially in real-time, so that appropriate actions can be taken against the user. At eBay, we developed such a system named Eagle, which collects audit logs from Hadoop clusters and applications running on them, analyzes users behavior, generates profiles per user of the system, and predicts anomalous user activities based on their prior profiles. Eagle is a highly scalable system, capable of monitoring multiple eBay clusters in real-time. It includes machine-learning algorithms that create user profiles based on the user's history of activities. As far as we know, this is the first activity monitoring system on the Hadoop-ecosystem for the detection of intrusion-related activities using behavior-based profiles of users. When a user performs any operation in the cluster, Eagle matches current user action against his prior activity pattern and raises alarm if it suspects anomalous action. We investigate two machine-learning algorithms: density estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we introduce the Eagle system, discuss the algorithms in detail, and show performance results. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the density estimation algorithm is 93%, however the sensitivity of our system increases by 4.94% (on average) to 98% (approximately) by using an ensemble of the two algorithms during anomaly detection.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363892","Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster;machine learning;user activity monitoring;user profiles","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Training","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","Big data analytics;Eagle system;Hadoop cluster;Hadoop-ecosystem;PCA;density estimation;eBay;intrusion-related activity;machine-learning algorithm;principal component analysis;security threat;user profile-based anomaly detection","","","","30","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These shared resources, easy accessibility and shared storage of resources are responsible for putting the confidential information under a great deal of risk. Although the cloud is becoming gigantic day by day but its efficiency is being hampered considerably due to the threats in the cloud computing environment. The threats in the cloud computing environment not only account to external attacks which are launched with the intention of hampering work flow of the cloud provider but the internal attacks also which are being launched so that the efficiency and the reliability of the cloud is at stake. The firewalls monitor traffic between networks such that all the traffic must flow through it, but they are certainly not sufficient to shield the dynamic cloud computing environment from all attacks. They may be able to subvert external attacks to a certain extent but internal attacks do not even pass through the firewalls, therefore rendering them useless. Moreover, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the virtual machines in order to set up large scale attacks like Ddos. They compromise these VM's into zombies and the detection of these VM's is very difficult because cloud users install all types of applications onto their VM's some of which may be malicious. Thus, the cloud needs stronger security for handling all the intrusions of every scale. An intrusion detection system is presented in the paper which detects the intrusions launched on the VM's which act an avenue for deploying large scale attacks, therefore, minimising the loss. The IDS presented in the paper is a network IDS and provides security from the IaaS based attacks.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065580","ARP;CSP;DNS;Ddos;IDS;VM","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;firewalls;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;confidential information;data loss;firewalls;intrusion detection;virtual machines;virtual networks","","0","","22","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
