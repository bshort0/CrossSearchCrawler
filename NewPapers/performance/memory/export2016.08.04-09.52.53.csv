An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","978-1-4799-0194-4;9781479901944","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation. The results of these experiments show that the correlation components are effective in achieving alert reduction and abstraction.

Indeed, existing techniques for network flow sanitization are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and solutions proposed for microdata anonymity cannot be directly applied to network traces. In our previous research, we proposed an obfuscation technique for network flows, providing formal confidentiality guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. In this paper, we identify the threats posed by the incremental release of network flows, we propose a novel defense algorithm, and we formally prove the achieved confidentiality guarantees.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion. We show through experiments that our scheme can provide a higher detection accurate rate and a lower false alarm rate than the existing detection scheme.

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.","","978-0-7695-2874-8;9780769528748","","10.1109/FSKD.2007.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun","data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation","data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries","","1","","18","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application. We also discuss tradeoffs that will need to be considered in further development of systems using this design.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","10.1145/1185347.1185365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579531","communications systems;networking;virtualization","Driver circuits;Hardware;Kernel;Linux;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Software","computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ASIC;Symerton project;XML processing;network processors;operating systems;packet processing complexity;proof-of-concept implementation;service provider networks;virtual machine","","0","11","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We then provide a numerical design procedure to determine the appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant.

Characterizing the service times of network IDSs is a crucial step in improving their real time performance. We analyzed about 41 million packets organized in five data sets of 10 minutes each collected at the entry point of a large production network and processed by Snort, a commonly used IDS. The processing times of the three main stages in Snort were measured. The main conclusions of our study were: (1) rule checking accounts for about 75% of the total processing time in IDSs, with mean pay load checking time being 4.5 times larger than mean header checking time. (2) The distribution of rule checking limes is markedly bimodal, a direct consequence of the bimodality in packet composition in current high speed Internet traffic. (3) Header processing times have a small variance and small correlation coefficients. (4) In contrast, the distribution of payload processing times displays high variance, in a form that can be generally characterized as ""slightly heavy-tailed"". Explicitly, payload processing times have a lognormal upper tail, clipped at the top 1%. This extreme 1% upper tail is better fit by an exponential distribution. (5) Additionally, payload processing times were shown to be highly correlated, with correlation coefficients several orders of magnitude higher than the confidence bands for the standard whiteness test. The impact of these findings in the design of IDSs for real time operation in networks is discussed, and compared with existing results for processing times for Unix processes, which were shown to display pronounced heavy-tailed characteristics.","0191-2216;01912216","0-7803-8682-5;0780386825","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428609","","Data security;Displays;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Production;Statistical distributions","Internet;exponential distribution;information systems;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;Snort;Unix processes;exponential distribution;lognormal upper tail;network intrusion detection system;payload processing times;security violations;statistical distribution","","17","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics.

However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CAN is distinguished by its simplicity, its real-time application compatibility and its low deployment cost. However, CAN major drawback is its lack of security support. That is, CAN fails to provide protections against attacks such as intrusion, denial of service or impersonation. We propose in this work a simple intrusion detection method for CAN.

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls. This paper describes the implementation of restricted execution environments for networks by composing simple and portable guards, and shows the advantages of the SysGuard security framework.","","0-7695-1852-4;0769518524","","10.1109/PRDC.2002.1185635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185635","","Access control;Computer bugs;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Guidelines;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Portable computers;Security","authorisation;operating system kernels;software portability;system monitoring","SysGuard;access control;guards;networks;operating system kernels;per-process jump table;portable composable kernel module;reference monitors;restricted execution environments;security modules;system calls","","2","1","19","","","16-18 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log.

IEEE 802.11 is the defacto wireless standard. It was designed to provide security however it failed to do so. As a result amendments/enhancements were made to overcome the flaws by first introducing Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) and then IEEE 802.11i. But both these enhancements failed to achieve the desired objectives especially availability. Unauthenticated management and control frames provide no protection against identity theft and are main cause of denial of service (DoS) attacks.

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Bandwidth;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Quality of service;Resource management;Security;Switches","","","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization.

Unfortunately, different from general-purpose ICT systems, enforcement mechanisms are generally very basic in INS. As a consequence, verifying the correctness of policy implementation becomes a crucial task, especially cumbersome when it needs to be carried out entirely by hand. This paper presents a new methodology, which also serves as the basis of a purposely developed software tool conceived to cope with the lack of policy enforcement mechanisms in INS and to allow semiautomatic verification of policy implementation. Our approach is based on a twofold system model that enables both the abstract specification of access control policies and the detailed description of the target physical system.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","8","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this study, the method is applied to the problem of computer intrusion detection in which symbolic profiles are learned for a computer system's users.

In behavior-based approaches to anomaly detection, the model of normal behavior is constructed from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns. Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Quantitative results are given for the recognition ability of contiguous-bits matching together with permutations.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262509","","Artificial immune systems;Biological systems;Computer science;Detectors;Distributed processing;Intrusion detection;Iron;Object detection;Pattern matching;Random variables","evolutionary computation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","anomalous pattern detection;anomaly detection;partial matching rule;pattern recognition;positive pattern detection;r-chunk rule","","47","1","69","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall.

This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9;9781467311809","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","7","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model.

We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","1","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4;1595933344","","10.1145/1127777.1127803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","12","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reach this goal, we specify this policy using 'Nomad' formal language which is based on deontic and temporal logics.

Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613","Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce","content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security","SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","12","","32","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.","","978-1-4577-1454-2;9781457714542","978-0-7695-4521-9;9780769545219","10.1109/ANCS.2011.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710","Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching","Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security","buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching","AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection","","1","","12","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
