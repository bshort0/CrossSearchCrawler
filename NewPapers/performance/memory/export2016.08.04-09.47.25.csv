Scalability to network traffic and easy updating of new attack patterns are mandatory requirements needed to perform this comparison. The simplest way to implement such system is using the memory-based deterministic finite automata, but their storage requirement is growing exponentially with the number of patterns. Another issue is the computation time in order to detect the attack in real time. This work has the goal to propose an efficient deep packet inspection (DPI) algorithm and to analyze its efficiently implementation using a specialized hardware circuit and the GPU CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture) enabled boards existing in the personal computers. The following tasks have been analyzed: the parallelization of the pattern matching algorithm and the optimization of C code written for Nvidia compiler to obtain the best performance. A comparison of processing speed of implementation methods is illustrated.","","978-1-4799-0899-8;9781479908998","","10.1109/TELSKS.2013.6704411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6704411","CUDA technology;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;pattern search;significant symbol","Algorithm design and analysis;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Instruction sets;Kernel;Registers","C language;computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata;graphics processing units;inspection;optimisation;packet radio networks;parallel architectures;parallel memories;pattern matching;telecommunication traffic","C code;CUDA;DPI algorithm;GPU;Nvidia compiler;computer unified device architecture;deep packet inspection;intrusive detection system implementation;memory-based deterministic finite automata;network attack detection;network traffic scalability;optimization;parallelization;pattern matching algorithm;personal computers;predefined attack pattern;specialized hardware circuit;storage requirement","","1","","7","","","16-19 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, current key management schemes are difficult to be deployed in wireless sensor networks. This paper proposes a new key management method that the shared keys are dynamic updated for wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme loads two hash functions and an initial key into the base station, cluster heads, and sensor nodes. Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station. The security of this scheme is analyzed and it shows that it is robust to the guessing attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and node capture attacks. The results show this scheme can also save communication resources.","","978-1-4577-1009-4;9781457710094","978-1-4577-1008-7;9781457710087","10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096693","Pair-wise key;dynamic updating;hash function","Authentication;Base stations;Encryption;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","base station;battery lifetime;cluster heads;computing capacity;dynamic updating-based key management algorithm;guessing attacks;hardware resources;hash functions;man-in-the-middle attacks;node capture attacks;pair wise key;replay attacks;sensor nodes;transmission secrecy;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","9-11 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we show a test-bed that we have developed to detect vulnerabilities within SCADA protocols against internal attacks in order to find out how easy it is to bypass security measures in such protocols. Furthermore, we have tested SCADA components to assess their vulnerabilities against the following attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, replay attacks, cryptographic attacks, and fragmentation attacks.

This paper explores the relationship between reliability engineering and security engineering for software products. Our work has indicated that designing for reliability and designing for security share many common ideas and, more importantly, techniques that can be leveraged in product development. Security failures are one aspect of product dependability, and while security failures are qualitatively different from other reliability failures in some ways, the two classes of failures have a great deal in common. International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.805 suggests that availability has a specific meaning for security, namely, that it “ensures that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications due to events impacting the network.” This definition is very similar to the definition of availability that reliability engineers use in describing functionality. This paper explores the similarities and differences in approaches taken within the communications domain for reliability and security.

The basic idea behind IMS is convergence; providing a single interface to different traditional or modern networking architectures allowing better working environment for the end users. IMS is still not commercially adopted and used but research is in progress to explore it. IMS is an IP based overlay next generation network architecture. It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS. KNN classifier effectively distinguishes the behavior of the system as normal or intrusive and achieve low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-2823-6;9781424428236","","10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777775","3GPP;DoS;IDS;IMS;KNN;PCSCF","Computer crime;Convergence;Degradation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Next generation networking;Protocols;Quality of service;TCPIP","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;pattern classification;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","3GPP;IP multimedia subsystem;IP protocols;IP spoofing;OpenIMS core;TCP;UDP flooding;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbor classifier;overlay next generation network architecture;proxy call session control function;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","1","","29","","","23-24 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems must be able to deal with today's high speed and large scale networks. In this paper we propose a distributed IDS that performs both data capturing and data analyzing in a distributed fashion. This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","5","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

The system monitors events in the environment, constructs patterns of event sequences, and finds strange and anomalous patterns. If any dangerous symptoms are detected in the environment, the system matches them to the timeline of events and finds a pattern that may have caused the symptoms.

Today's software based NIDSs (eg. Snort) show inef ciency and even fail to perform for the faster Internet. Implementing stateful TCP inspection in EPGA aims at achieving an ef cient, fast NIDS in general, - Snort speci cally. By dividing a TCP connection into two ows, one to the Sewer and another to the Client, monitoring of the TCP ow can be sped up. A TCP ow deals not only with a single packet but also with multiple packets over the network. Reassembly of those packets is one of the main tusks that the TCP ow monitoring should accomplish. By parallelizing the tasks of reassembling TCP packets on the Sewer and the Client on an EPGA, the performance of stateful TCP inspection can be greatly improved.

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

To provide a proof-of-concept of our thesis, we design and implement our system as a kernel module in Linux. We perform the time series analysis of 118 parameters of Linux task structures and pre-process them to come up with a minimal features' set of 11 features. Our analysis show that these features have remarkably different values for benign and malicious processes; as a result, a number of classifiers operating on these features provide 93% detection accuracy with 0% false alarm rate within 100 milliseconds.

In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, entropy-based analysis detect distributed small amount of 80/TCP anomaly accesses compared to the frequency-based analysis. Secondly, one hour window size is most sensitive to find the 80/TCP anomaly accesses.

State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT).

Cloud computing uses virtualisation technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its advantages. Virtualisation is the key to consolidate the computing resources to run multiple instances on each hardware, increasing the utilization rate of every resource, thus reduces the number of resources needed to buy, rack, power, cool, and manage. Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment. In this paper, we present an elastic framework to secure virtualised environment for trusted cloud computing called Server Virtualisation Security System (SVSS). SVSS provide security solutions located on hypervisor for Virtual Machines by deploying malicious activity detection techniques, network traffic analysis techniques, and system resource utilization analysis techniques. SVSS consists of four modules: Anti-Virus Control Module, Traffic Behavior Monitoring Module, Malicious Activity Detection Module and Virtualisation Security Management Module.

In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted.

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters. We show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the total expected cost as the error constraints approach zero.

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","21","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile.

It is an indispensable part of the information security system. Due to the variety of network behaviors and the rapid development of attack fashions, it is necessary to develop fast machine-learning-based intrusion detection algorithms with high detection rates and low false-alarm rates. In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm has low computational complexity and error rates, as compared with algorithms of higher computational complexity, as tested on the benchmark sample data.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2007.914695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454220","AdaBoost;computational complexity;detection rate;false-alarm rate;intrusion detection","","Internet;computational complexity;error analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost-based algorithm;Internet;computational complexity;decision stumps;false-alarm rates;information security system;intrusion detection algorithm;machine learning;network intrusion detection","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Decision Support Techniques;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","32","3","57","","","April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node. Periodically monitor node is identified in the network.","","978-0-7695-3126-7;9780769531267","","10.1109/ISA.2008.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511525",": IDS;CDMA;DoS;QoS;TDMA;mIDS","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Availability;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Protection;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;cryptography;mobile computing;packet radio networks;telecommunication security","authentication;encryption software;firewalls;mobile computing environment;mobile intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;packet transmissions;response systems;security services;wireless networks","","3","","21","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time. RCDFA consistently achieves over 95% compression ratio for existing real-life rule sets. Implemented in a single Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform, RCDFA matching engine achieved 12Gbps throughput.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5963291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963291","","Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Pattern matching;Throughput","computer networks;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;telecommunication traffic","Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA platform;bitmap technique;content aware network processing;deterministic finite automata;next state transitions;regular expression matching;reorganized and compact DFA","","3","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.","","0-7695-3114-8;0769531148","","10.1109/UKSIM.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488934","distributed monitoring;fuzzy logic;internet security;intrusion prevention","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Real time systems;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","","","","6","","6","","","1-3 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","3","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3;9781424484843","978-0-7695-4159-4;9780769541594","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","4","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These cybercrime activities has ultimately resulted in CC attack classification as a serious problem in network security domain while machine learning has been subjected to extensive research area in intrusion classification with emphasis on improving the rate of classifier's accuracy or improving the data mining model performance. This study is another attempt, using rough set theory (RST), a rule based decision making approach to extract rules for intrusion attacks classification. Experiments were performed on publicly available data to explore the performance of four different algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm, covering algorithm, LEM2 and Exhaustive algorithms. It is observed that RST classification based on genetic algorithm for rules generation yields best performance as compared to other mentioned rules generation algorithms. Moreover, by applying the proposed technique on publicly available dataset about intrusion attacks, the results show that the proposed approach can fully predict all intrusion attacks and also provides prior useful information to the security engineers or developers to conduct a mandating action.","","","","10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2015.7351952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351952","Classification;Cyber-terrorism;Cybercrime;Intrusion Prediction;Rough Set Theory","Approximation methods;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Genetic algorithms;Set theory;Yttrium","computer network security;data mining;decision making;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;smart phones","CC activity;CC attack classification;RST classification;cyber attack classification;cyber-crime activity;data mining model performance;electronic device;genetic algorithm;intrusion classification;machine learning;network security domain;rough set theory;rule generation algorithm;rule-based decision making approach;security threat;smart phone","","","","26","","","10-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When WSNs are deployed in inaccessible areas, the probability of occurring different types of attacks is very high. So the security of WSN becomes extremely important. As sensors have limited processing power, limited storage, low bandwidth, and energy; traditional security measures designed for the resource-rich networks such as LAN etc. are not suitable for the resource-constrained WSN. In presence of such limitations it becomes mandatory to devise lightweight security solutions for data transmission in WSNs. Because of problems in public key cryptography such as costly key computation, longer keys, key vulnerability to brute force attack, key distribution and maintenance, etc., it is not preferred for WSN. The less computation and low memory requirements of symmetric key cryptography with very short length of key (lightweight) justifies its use in WSN to achieve information security. Hence, this paper aims to study, discuss and analyze the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms Suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks.","","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507438","Authenticity;Availability;Confidentiality;Data Freshness;Integrity;Lightweight Cryptography","Communication system security;Cryptography;Monitoring;Schedules;Vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","data transmission;environmental conditions;lightweight cryptographic algorithms;lightweight cryptography;public key cryptography;resource constrained WSN;resource rich networks;small sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7;0769522947","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
