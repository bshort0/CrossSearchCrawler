The traditional security means can not respond to such attacks, and resources, the higher the value, the greater the risk. In addition, under the existing distributed environment, there is no centralized authority to obtain all of the interactive information, which results in unreliable and uncertain risks. Trust management to solve this kind of problem recognizes the open system integrity and security information system. Security system decision-making does not require third-party feedback. This resource is the basic object of study, trust evaluation system is established to quantify from the multi-granularity, multi-point security, making the distribution system with the characteristics of trust.

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied. They are designed and simulated in VHDL using Modelsim tool.","","978-1-4244-4789-3;9781424447893","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204400","Field programmable gate array;Hash;Network intrusion detection System;payload scanning","Communication system traffic control;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;string matching;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;Modelsim tool;VHDL;Word Split Hash algorithm;content-based security threats;hardware based pattern matching;hash based algorithm;high speed network;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet header;packet inspection;packet payload;payload scanning;string matching algorithm;virus detection","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel hypothesis in immunology, the danger theory (DT), is emerging to meet these challenges. DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal. In order to reduce the false positive and increase robustness for detection system, a notion of multi-tissues cooperation to sense dangers in IDS is also demonstrated based on the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2113-8;9781424421138","978-1-4244-2114-5;9781424421145","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593657","Danger Theory;Data Field;Intrusion Detection;Tissue","Artificial immune systems;Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Context awareness;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Signal processing","pattern clustering;security of data","antigen data clustering;antigen presentation;bioinspired multitissues growing algorithm;danger theory;data fields;intrusion detection system","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3;9781457705243","978-0-7695-4429-8;9780769544298","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many detection systems have been proposed so far, most of them can detect only part of alteration. Some detection systems use canaries to detect alteration. However, if an execution code has bugs that enable attackers to read data in memory, the system could be bypassed by attackers who can guess canaries. To overcome the problems, we propose a system using alteration of data. Our proposed system detects illegal alteration with verifier for vulnerable data. Verifier is made before vulnerable data could be altered by attackers, and verifier is checked when the program uses the vulnerable data. Part of verifier is stored in kernel area to prevent attackers from reading data in user memory. Our approach can detect illegal alteration of arbitrary data in user memory.

The proposed algorithm uses software bitmap for each multi-pattern signature without hardware changes, which maximizes flexibility of content processor. From the analysis of Snort which is the widely used intrusion detection system, we observe spatial locality between distances of patterns in the multi-pattern signature. The algorithm makes use of this distance information for adaptive performance optimization.

A better understanding of the protein sequence-structure correlation can improve effectiveness and efficiency of local protein structure prediction. For the structural-cluster approach, protein structural segments are grouped into different structural clusters using multiple structural alignments and unsupervised clustering algorithms. The support vector machine (SVM) has shown superior classification performance in various bioinformatics applications because of its strong generalization capability. In order to overcome disadvantages of building one SVM over the whole sample space, the clustering support vector machine (CSVM) was proposed to predict distance matrices, torsion angles, and secondary structures for backbone -carbon atoms of protein sequence segments. The special features of CSVMs enable the training tasks for each CSVM to be parallelized.

Furthermore, we suggest a set of questions that will aid in the process of cloud forensics analysis.","","","","10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544395","cloud computing;cloud forensics;digital forensics;distributed computing;virtualization","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Servers;Virtualization","cloud computing;digital forensics;distributed processing;virtualisation","cloud computing;cloud forensics analysis;cloud services;digital forensics;distributed computing;research perspective;underpinning elements;virtualization","","4","","30","","","17-19 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently there is a trend that many DDoS attacks utilize Internet relay chat (IRC) infrastructures as the communication channels. In this paper we propose an intrusion surveillance system (ISS) to detect IRC-based DDoS attacks. The main functions of ISS are to observe network conditions, gather intelligence from distributed sources, and determine what potential attacks will likely happen. We give the detailed design of ISS in this paper. We also implement this system by using a new approach of text-based decision making - distributed preference-based surveillance (DPBS) algorithm. By experiments we demonstrate that this distributed algorithm can effectively identify potential IRC-based DDoS attacks based on the information from different locations","","0-7695-2690-X;076952690X","0-7695-2690-X;076952690X","10.1109/ICCGI.2006.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4124084","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Computer crime;Decision making;Distributed algorithms;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Relays;Surveillance;Web and internet services","Internet;computer crime;distributed algorithms;electronic messaging;surveillance","IRC-based DDoS attacks;Internet relay chat infrastructures;communication channels;distributed algorithm;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed preference-based surveillance algorithm;intrusion surveillance system;text-based decision making","","0","","21","","","Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DBSCAN needs less knowledge of input parameters. Major advantage of DBSCAN is to identify arbitrary shape objects and removal of noise during the clustering process. Beside its familiarity, DBSCAN has problems with handling large databases and in worst case its complexity reaches to O(n<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems.

In this paper we apply TDE (Trusted Domain Enforcement) for embedded Linux 2.6 series in order to achieve dynamic sandboxing. TDE is a concept showed in TCSEC (Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria) for input validation and sandbox for protecting system. TDE is a kind of extension of TE (Type Enforcement) for dynamic sandboxing although its implementation could be reasonably simple.

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats. Our analysis reveal conflicts in each of them.","","978-1-4244-5344-3;9781424453443","978-0-7695-3805-1;9780769538051","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341717","attack signitures;intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer security;Event detection;Hemorrhaging;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Payloads;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic","knowledge based systems;security of data","bleeding edge threat;conflict detection;open source Snort IDS;rule management framework;rule misconfiguration classification;rule misconfiguration discovery;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect intrusion, in general, Intrusion Detection System(IDS) has a copy step where P packet is captured at kernel level and it is used for detection in user level. While doing this job, the next packet cannot be captured because this procedure isn??t finished yet. This paper proposes the Kernel-level Intrusion Detection System(KIDS) which can detect various network attacks with minimum packet loss. This system is executed in kernel as a kernel program, and can detect intrusion at kernel level without copy step. Dynamic rule change is done quickly through appending and setting a delete mark operation. After this work, it is not needed to reboot a kernel and new type of network attack can be detected easily. With the help of this dynamic rule change, waiting time of detection process is minimized and its job can be continued as quickly as possible. Due to these features, the packet loss is greatly reduced.","","89-5519-119-7;8955191197","","10.1109/ICACT.2004.1292859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292859","Intrusion Detection System;kernel-level intrusion detection;signature-based detection","Availability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data security;Delta modulation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Protection;Web and internet services","","","","1","","12","","","9-11 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1811-3923;18113923","978-1-4244-4704-6;9781424447046","978-1-4244-3474-9;9781424434749","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold.

Cloud providers specifically are at risk because of the pure mass of data they accrue over the many applications they serve, so they have a responsibility to protect both themselves and their users. Without the keys, however, they can't provide the service they require. A method to acquire these keys is to use virtual machine introspection (VMI), a technique that allows an application to read the internal state of a virtual machine. Current methods are expensive and require the application to read the entire virtual machine's memory. The authors present an efficient approach to acquire RSA keys, commonly used on the Internet, using the forensic virtual machine (FVM) framework. This framework provides the ability, from another virtual machine to use VMI to find, analyze, and act on these findings.","2325-6095;23256095","","","10.1109/MCC.2015.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7331177","asymmetric cryptography;cloud;cloud computing;forensics;key retrieval;virtual machine introspection","Ciphers;Cloud computing;Forensics;Operating systems;Random access memory;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;public key cryptography;virtual machines","FVM framework;IDS;Internet;RSA key material;TLS;VMI;cloud provider;eavesdropper;forensic virtual machine framework;intrusion detection system;personal data;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine memory","","","","12","","","Sept.-Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security mechanisms can depend on the hardware that is available and can be changed over time. Offering a system that can cope with such change without the need of major re-engineering is a major challenge. Moreover, not at all time the same security level has to be maintained. A system that can adapt its security mechanisms to the actual threat level can deliver better performance.

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting.

Furthermore, the periodic components are detected using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique.","","978-1-4673-5827-9;9781467358279","","10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583469","Contiki;Lomb-Scargle periodogram;compressed sensing;energy-efficiency;malicious traffic analysis;signal processing;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;Power demand;Signal processing;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","compressed sensing;maintenance engineering;microsensors;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique;advanced signal processing techniques;compressed sensing principle;deployment cost;energy-efficient protocols;maintenance cost;malicious traffic analysis;microsensor hardware technology;periodic components;wireless sensor networks;wireless traffic analysis;wireless transmissions","","1","","24","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stealthy superpoint is a host that its cardinality is between two thresholds during a measurement period. Detecting stealthy superpoints helps intrusion systems identify potential attackers. However, stealthy superpoints may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate, and they can easily evade the detection. The existing algorithm can not directly be used to detect them. This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm can precisely detect stealthy superpoints and estimate their cardinalities.","","978-1-4799-5078-2;9781479950782","","10.1109/DASC.2014.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945711","Bitmap;Stealthy superpoints;host cardinality","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Estimation;Indexes;Internet","Internet;computer crime;computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","Bloom filter;Internet host;attackers identification;bitmap-based algorithm;duplicate packets;host cardinality;intrusion systems;offline module;online module;peers;process packets;source addresses;stealthy superpoint detection;two-dimensional bit arrays","","0","","14","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Successful and time-critical detection of such activity often depends on large-scale deployment. However, commercial organizations usually do not share honeypot data, and large, open honeypot initiatives only provide read-only alert feeds. As a result, while large and resourceful organizations can afford the high cost of this technology, smaller security firms and security researchers are fundamentally constrained. We propose and build a shared infrastructure for deploying and monitoring honeypots, called HoneyLab, that is similar in spirit to PlanetLab. With an overlay and distributed structure of address space and computing resources, HoneyLab increases coverage and accelerates innovation among security researchers as well as security industry experts relying on honeypot-based attack detection technology. Unlike current honeypot infrastructures, HoneyLab allows security firms and security researchers to deploy their own honeypot services, instrumentation code, and detection algorithms, dispensing the need for setting up a separate honeypot infrastructure whenever a new attack detection method needs to be deployed or tested.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319295","honeypot;honeypot infrastructures;security","Costs;Data security;Distributed computing;Feeds;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Resource management;Space technology;Time factors","Internet;security of data","Internet;commercial organization;honeypot-based attack detection technology;large-scale deployment;malicious activity;planetlab;read-only alert feed;resource sharing;time-critical detection","","2","","25","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques.

Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called IntruDetector. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation. The main properties of this approach are: (1) the background traffic is realistic; (2) it allows flexible simulation of various types of intrusions; and (3) normal system operation will not be disrupted by virtually simulated destructive intrusions during testing.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991516","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data security;Detection algorithms;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Software algorithms;Software testing;System testing;Traffic control","authorisation;hybrid simulation;program testing","IDS;IntruDetector;algorithm testing;flexible simulation;hybrid simulation;information infrastructure;intrusion detection system;monitoring;network intrusion detection;realistic background traffic;security information;software platform","","1","","24","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network quarantine channels and associated techniques are used to perform further interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic.

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

Biological information processing systems have various interesting characteristics from an engineering viewpoint. Among them, the immune system plays an important role in maintaining its own system against dynamically changing environments. Based on this fact, we have investigated a new decentralized consensus-making system for the behavior of autonomous mobile robots, inspired by the immune idiotypic network hypothesis in immunology. The developmental encoding scheme is used to translate a given genotype into a complete agent, which then acts in a physically-realistic virtual environment. Evolution is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, in which the genotypes are treated as genetic regula- tory networks. The dynamics of the regulatory network direct the growth of the agent, and lead to the construction of both the morphology and neural control of the agent. We demonstrate that such a model can be used to evolve agents to perform non-trivial tasks, such as directed locomotion and block pushing in a noisy environment.","1089-778X;1089778X","0-7803-9487-9;0780394879","","10.1109/CEC.2006.1688334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688334","","Biological information theory;Encoding;Evolution (biology);Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Information processing;Maintenance engineering;Mobile robots;Morphology;Virtual environment","genetic algorithms;mobile robots","autonomous mobile robots;bio-inspired agent system;decentralized consensus-making system;developmental encoding scheme;dynamic environments;evolutionary agent systems;evolutionary metaphor;genetic algorithm;genetic regulatory networks;genotypes;immune idiotypic network hypothesis;immune system;immunology;neural control","","1","","12","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Only knowing whether a message contains an attack, however, is not always enough to mitigate the threat. It may also be critical to know what it does. Unfortunately, shell code is written in low-level assembly language, and can be obfuscated. The current method of analyzing shell code, manual reverse engineering, is time-consuming, requires significant expertise, and would be nearly impossible for a wide-scale polymorphic attack. In this paper, we introduce Spector, a symbolic execution engine that extracts meaningful high-level actions from shell code. Spector's high-level output helps facilitate attack mitigation and classification of different payloads that have the same behavior. To evaluate Spector, we tested it with over 23,000 unique payloads. It identified eleven different classes of shell code, and processed all the payloads in just over three hours. Spector also successfully classified polymorphic instances of the same shell code.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4413015","","Application software;Assembly;Buffer overflow;Computer security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Payloads;Reverse engineering;Search engines","security of data;systems analysis","Spector;buffer overflow attacks;low-level assembly language;shell code;symbolic execution engine;wide-scale polymorphic attack","","0","2","32","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2;9781467320672","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","1","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539;15267539","978-1-4244-4927-9;9781424449279","978-1-4244-4928-6;9781424449286","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous research efforts have focused on boosting packet processing performance by offloading to discrete Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). While integrated GPUs, residing on the same die with the CPU, offer many advanced features such as on-chip interconnect CPU-GPU communication, and shared physical/virtual memory, their applicability for packet processing workloads has not been fully understood and exploited. In this paper, we conduct in-depth profiling and analysis to understand the integrated GPU's capabilities and performance potential for packet processing workloads. Based on that understanding, we introduce a GPU accelerated network packet processing framework that fully utilizes integrated GPU's massive parallel processing capability without the need for large numbers of packet batching, which might cause a significant processing delay. We implemented the proposed framework and evaluated the performance with several common, light-weight packet processing workloads on the Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> Processor E3-1200 v4 product family (codename Broadwell) with an integrated GT3e GPU.

All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-8178-1;9781424481781","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347","autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs","Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing","Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents","","0","","11","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network. The experiments show good detection quality and illustrate the usefulness of adapting to normality.","1545-0678;15450678","0-7695-2328-5;0769523285","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437175","","Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Electronic mail;Face detection;Indexing;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Testing","IP networks;data mining;data structures;pattern clustering;real-time systems;telecommunication security","ADW ICE;IP network;KDD data set;anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering;data mining techniques;data structures;grid-based index;real-time anomaly detection","","1","","15","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","X. Ou; S. R. Rajagopalan; S.

Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3919-5;9780769539195","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","4","1","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They generally want to avoid honeypots since it is hard to spread attacks from them, attacks are thoroughly monitored on them, and some honeypots contain planted false information. This suggests that it could be useful for a computer system to pretend it is a honeypot, to scare away smarter attackers. We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of ""vaccination"" of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues. We also report experiments with real attackers against a honeypot of increasing obviousness. Results show that attacks on it decreased over time which may indicate that attackers are being scared away.

Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless.

"An anomalous behavior detection model in cloud computing","Xiaoming Ye; X. Chen; Haizhou Wang; Xuemei Zeng; G. Shao; X.

Virtual Machines (VMs) are one of the key components of cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The security of such VMs is critical to IaaS security. Many studies have been done on cloud computing security issues, but research into VM security issues, especially regarding VM network traffic anomalous behavior detection, remains inadequate. More and more studies show that communication among internal nodes exhibits complex patterns. Communication among VMs in cloud computing is invisible. Researchers find such issues challenging, and few solutions have been proposed???leaving cloud computing vulnerable to network attacks. This paper proposes a model that uses Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to implement traffic redirection. Our model can capture inter-VM traffic, detect known and unknown anomalous network behaviors, adopt hybrid techniques to analyze VM network behaviors, and control network systems. The experimental results indicate that the effectiveness of our approach is greater than 90%, and prove the feasibility of the model.","","","","10.1109/TST.2016.7488743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488743","anomaly detection;cloud computing;network behavior;virtual machine","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Decision analysis;Security;Virtual machining;Virtualization","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a scalable and flexible architecture and a novel algorithm, to detect and block port scans in real time. The proposed architecture detects fast scanners as well as stealth scanners having large inter-probe periods. FPGA implementation of the proposed system gives an average throughput of 2 Gbps with a system clock frequency of 100 MHz on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. Experimental results on real network trace show the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting and blocking network scans with very low false positives and false negatives.","","978-1-4577-1741-3;9781457717413","","10.1109/FPT.2011.6132712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132712","","Aggregates;Clocks;Computer aided manufacturing;Field programmable gate arrays;IP networks;Random access memory;Throughput","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA;Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA;fast scanners;field programmable gate array;frequency 100 MHz;network port scan detection system;stealth scanners","","0","","21","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
