This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7;9781467355247","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Searching through entire packet headers and payloads, NIDSs can identify and classify the packets that contain malicious patterns. The most essential technology to the NIDS is an efficient multiple-pattern matching algorithm, which performs exact string matching between packets and a large set of patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm (HMA) for intrusion detection, which is a two-tier and cluster-wise matching algorithm. HMA drastically reduces the amount of external memory access as well as required memory space, enabling an efficient and cost-effective real-time IDS. The simulations show that HMA significantly improves the matching performance in both the average and the worst cases (about 1.7-63 times better than the state-of-the-art algorithms).","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577938","","Clustering algorithms;Data security;Databases;Engines;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection","computer networks;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication security","cluster-wise matching algorithm;hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm;malicious patterns;network security threats;network-based intrusion detection system;packet headers;payloads;string matching;two-tier matching algorithm","","2","2","17","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic.

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines.

Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4577-2135-9;9781457721359","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","2","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","1063-6897;10636897","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","40","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture.

For that importance, IDS has become one of targeted research area that focuses on information security. Among different techniques, Steady State Genetic-Based Machine Learning Algorithm (SSGBML) offers the ability to detect intrusions especially in changing environments. The objective of this paper is to incorporate several feature selection. Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate.

In this paper, a kind of hardware based compact DFA structure for multiple regexes matching called CPDFA is presented. According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198833","","Application software;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security","DFA Structure;deterministic finite automata;indirect index;multiple regular expressions matching;parallel SRAMs;real-time deep packet inspection;regular expression matcher","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, those efforts concentrated on preventive techniques constituting a first line of defense (like cryptography and authentication), which are effective in inhibiting the diverse malicious attacks. Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one. The latter line of defense is known as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). While mature in wired and many types of wireless networks, IDSs are envisaged to have more opportunities in WSNs. In this paper, we study the incorporation of IDSs in WSN-based ITSs.

MANET is vulnerable to attacks such as Black hole attack, Gray hole attack, wormhole attack, Sybil attack, and Route table modification attack. Black hole attack has serious impact on routing and delivery ratio of packets. To overcome Black hole attack, a mechanisms such as trust based routing, intrusion detection system, sequence number comparison and Data Routing Information table (DRI) has been proposed.

Mesh client in our scheme only needs to prestore a key seed, which can be used to generate a column of secret matrix. It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients. Security and complexity analysis show that the new scheme possesses several desirable features: 1) neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; 2) the new scheme is updatable, scalable, and robust against node capture attacks; and 3) communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2287196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650019","Pairwise key;deployment knowledge;matrix;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","Computational efficiency;Computer security;Knowledge engineering;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;matrix algebra;wireless mesh networks","WMN;complexity analysis;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh client;neighbor mesh clients;pre deployment knowledge;secret matrix;security analysis;wireless mesh networks","","1","","23","","2013-10-30","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A crucial part of this strategy is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action.

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6;9781424498796","978-0-7695-4330-7;9780769543307","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","2","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing population growth, the number of energy consumers is also increasing rapidly. The existing metering system is manual, which is very unreliable in terms of data retrieval. The existing manual metering system is incapable of fulfilling the current and future demands (i.e., real time metering and monitoring, energy theft, automatic meter reading and reliable meter data retrieval). Advance metering infrastructure (AMI) is the alternate solution to meet the current demands and challenges of manual metering system. AMI system can be implemented by various methods depending on the communication techniques. In this paper we suggest the hybrid system model for Lahore and Karachi.

Initially an artificial immune system detects anomalous network connections. In order to attain more detailed information about an intrusion, PCA is applied for classification and neural networks are used for online computing.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2503399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360925","Bayesian network;cybersecurity;incident prediction;industrial control system (ICS);multiple models;risk assessment","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Industrial control;Risk management","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Management of these processors and other system resources to achieve high forwarding rates is a key challenge. In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some limitations such as reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect sensor nodes. These limitations mostly affect the security of wireless networks. Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for detecting and monitoring selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks.

Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on","20041101","2004","","","206","215","Future distributed systems may include large self-organizing networks of locally communicating sensor nodes, any small number of which may be subvened by an adversary. Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-2161-4;0769521614","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As email service usage is increasing day by day, hackers or attackers are also playing a vital role to destruct email service and even to crash the email server. Due to this, it is a challenging task today to the system administrators to provide secure email service. In this paper, security policy is defined at operating system level, mail application level and network infrastructure level. A policy at system level specifies mandatory usage profile, usages of system sensitive resources such as file system objects, processes, system memory and inter process communication objects. Policies for mail application are defined with sensitive files/directories and parameters, which have impact in delivering a service. Policies for network are defined for controlling inbound and outbound traffic, specifying demilitarized zone, denying misuse of public IP and detecting suspicious network activity. The proposed system architecture supports the layered approach in policy enforcement, proactive defensive mechanism against security violations and scope for new policy discovery. The approach is prototyped on Linux-2.4.21-4 and have built rules for squirrel mail version 1.4.5 to detect security violations in a mail service at run-time.","","0-7695-2635-7;0769526357","","10.1109/ICIT.2006.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273182","","Communication system security;Communication system traffic control;Computer crashes;Computer hacking;File systems;Network servers;Operating systems;Postal services;Prototypes;Runtime","IP networks;computer crime;electronic mail","demilitarized zone;file system objects;inter process communication objects;mail application level;mandatory usage profile;network infrastructure;operating system;policy enforcement;policy specification;public IP;secure email service;security policy;security violations;squirrel mail version 1.4.5;suspicious network activity;system memory","","0","2","15","","","18-21 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work follows the linguistic fuzzy modelling approach. It uses an extended Classifier System (XCS) as mechanism to extract linguistic fuzzy rules. XCS is one of the most successful accuracy-based learning classifier systems. It provides several mechanisms for rule generalization and also allows for online training if necessary. It can be used in sequential and non-sequential tasks. Although originally applied in discrete domains it has been extended to continuous and fuzzy environments.

When an intrusion attack strikes the system then its services have to be truncated and system become unavailable temporarily. To make the system available to the end user in the vulnerable state, the specialized access control should be in place. Therefore, specialized and secure authentication methods are required. Authenticating through these methods, users can become active again to the system and considered as safe. The long and complex nxn passwords are used and considered to be very useful in certain alarming situations such as the system being under threat. Proposed hybrid methods works on the two portions of the password that is server generated part and user created part and ensure the secure authentication to the system resources that is under threat. Proposed methods are classified on the basis of symmetrical displacement of server generated part and user created part of the password. The strength and limitations of all the proposed methods have also been analyzed.","","978-1-4673-1937-9;9781467319379","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297155","Bit Entropy;NIST;Rotational Reformation;nxn password","NIST;Servers;Training","authorisation;message authentication;workflow management software","authentication method security;server generated part;server symmetrical displacement;specialized access control;two dimensional password based hybrid authentication methods;two-dimensional nxn passwords;user created part;vulnerable workflows","","0","","17","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. Finally, the intrusion detection method is evaluated through simulation experiments.","","","","10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60163-2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072389","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocol;security;timed automata","Automata;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","","","","Aug. 2008","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

None of the existing wireless security protocols considers protection against them. We propose a novel scheme that detects and reduce DoS attacks in the WLANs. The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5;9781467301275","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Memory required for hardware architecture is also a crucial problem. In this paper, we have performed classification of packets using basic XNOR gate.
