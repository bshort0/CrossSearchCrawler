An SMM is expected to produce correct outcomes while scanning the input data at high rates. Furthermore the string sets that are searched for are usually large and their sizes increase steadily. Bloom Filters (BFs) are hashing data structures which are fast but their false positive results require further processing. That is, their speed can be exploited for Standard Bloom Filter SMMs (SBFs) as long as the positive probability is low. Multiple BFs in parallel can further increase the throughput. In this paper, we propose the Double Bloom Filter SMM (DBF) which achieves a higher throughput than the SBF and maintains a high throughput even for large positive probabilities. The second Bloom Filter of DBF stores a small enough subset of the positive strings such that its false positive probability is approximately zero. We develop an analytical model of the DBF and show that the throughput advantage of DBF over SBF becomes more prominent if the positive probability and the fraction of matches in the second Bloom Filter increase. Accordingly, we propose a heuristic algorithm that stores the strings that are more frequently matched in the second Bloom Filter according to localities identified in the input. Our numerical results are obtained using realistic values from an FPGA implementation and are validated by SystemC simulations.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2577033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485864","Bloom filter;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate array (FPGA);string matching","Analytical models;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Matched filters;Metadata;Throughput;Time factors","","","","","","","","2016-06-06","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address.

It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform.

In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","4","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They have become stealthier over the years as a consequence of the ongoing struggle between attackers and system defenders. In order to explore the next step in rootkit evolution and to build strong defenses, we look at this issue from the point of view of an attacker. We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS. Cloaker also demonstrates that a self-contained execution environment for malicious code can be provided without relying on the host OS for any services. Integrity checks of hardware state in each of the machine's devices are required in order to detect rootkits such as Cloaker. We present a framework for the Linux kernel that incorporates integrity checks of hardware state performed by device drivers in order to counter the threat posed by rootkits such as Cloaker.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3168-7;9780769531687","","10.1109/SP.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531160","ARM;operating system;rootkit;security","Computer science;Computer security;Counting circuits;Hardware;Immune system;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Operating systems;Privacy;Virtual machining","Linux;security of data","Cloaker;Linux kernel;device drivers;hardware state modifications;hardware supported rootkit concealment;malicious attackers;rootkit detection techniques;system defenders","","5","","57","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2;9780769535012","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy. The key to the accuracy of the Statistical IDS lies in the classification algorithm adopted and the training data set used.

The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","8","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the computer systems of an enterprise are modeled with CySeMoL, this inference engine can assess the probability that attacks on the systems will succeed. The theory used for the attack-probability calculations in CySeMoL is a compilation of research results on a number of security domains and covers a range of attacks and countermeasures.

In this paper, an autonomic monitoring framework for the web service-enabled application software is proposed. Software resources are web service-enabled on the basis of elastic hardware resources???physical machines or virtual machines. Both of the software services and underlying hardware resources are dynamically monitored. An autonomic monitoring algorithm with self-optimized updating period and self-adaptive event-driven update is also given for the dynamic information retrieving of software services and underlying hardware resources.

However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","2158-9178;21589178","978-0-7695-3747-4;9780769537474","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2;9781424499052","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the virtual machines can be running different operating systems and applications, the attacker can exploit even a single vulnerability in any of the operating system or applications in a single virtual machine to attack other machines in the virtual domain. There is a need to develop intrusion detection techniques to deal with different types of attacks in virtual domains. In this paper we consider the design choices for attack detection and propose intrusion detection architecture to deal with attacks in virtual domains.

Anonymization of network data for sharing sets up a fundamental tradeoff between privacy protection versus security analysis capability. This privacy/analysis tradeoff has been acknowledged by many researchers but this is the first paper to provide empirical measurements to characterize the privacy/analysis tradeoff for an enterprise dataset. Specifically we perform anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529343","privacy-enhanced security data sharing","Access control;Automation;Collaboration;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Pattern analysis;Protection;Risk analysis","data privacy;security of data","anonymized packet traces;distributed security analysis;intrusion detection system alarms;network data;privacy protection;security analysis capability","","0","","32","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system. Evaluation on Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network corpus shows higher detection accuracy at 87% compare to 56% for Snort signatures. Moreover, false negative reduces to 14% compared to 78% for Snort signatures.","","978-1-4244-8647-2;9781424486472","","10.1109/SCORED.2010.5703974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703974","Signatures generation;behavioural approach;intrusion detection system;rapid malcode","","Internet;alarm systems;behavioural sciences;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;Snort signature;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network;automated malcode signatures generation;automatic signature generation technique;legitimate traffic block;malicious code;selfreplicating malicious program;signature based firewalls network intrusion detection system;signature based malcode detector;signature based tool;sound vulnerability signature;warning system","","0","","24","","","13-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource. We describe how this may be extended to securely set up an interactive session on a remote host, and the additional security issues associated with interactive session management. We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files. We also propose a new approach to scoping the security needs of grid systems by defining three generic scenarios: mutual trust, partial trust and mutual distrust.

This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms. In addition, as FVMs make use of the computational resources of the system we will present an algorithm for sharing of the FVMs so that they can be guided to search for the symptoms in the VMs with higher priority.","1541-7719;15417719","978-1-4673-2444-1;9781467324441","","10.1109/EDOC.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337247","Cloud;security;virtualisation","Algorithm design and analysis;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","FVM;Internet;VM;cloud computing;cloud security;command & control module;forensic virtual machines;human pathology;identifying symptoms;malicious behaviour;malware detection;virtual machines","","8","","19","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of relying on requirements checklists, security experts rely on their expertise and background knowledge to identify security vulnerabilities. To understand the gap between available checklists and practice, we conducted a series of interviews to encode the decision-making process of security experts and novices during security requirements analysis. Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications. Our goal is to build a model that researchers can use to evaluate their security requirements methods against how experts transition through different situation awareness levels in their decision-making process.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890522","Security;decision-making;patterns;requirements analysis;situation awareness","Decision making;Encoding;Firewalls (computing);Interviews;Software;Uncertainty","decision making;formal specification;security of data;source code (software)","coding theory;cognitive theory;decision-making patterns;decision-making process;grounded analysis;network diagrams;requirements checklist;security expertise;security experts;security requirements analysis;security vulnerabilities;situation awareness;source code;specifications ambiguity","","1","","20","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers in the field of network security and system survivability have been developing mechanisms to detect DoS attacks. By doing so they hope to maximize accurate detections (true-positive) and minimize non-justified detections (false-positive). This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan. Results show that our method can identify all occurrences and all hosts associated with attack activities, with a low percentage of false positive.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-1229-7;9781424412297","978-1-4244-1230-3;9781424412303","10.1109/ICON.2007.4444065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444065","","Availability;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","DoS attack;Internet;denial of service;lightweight detection;network security;system survivability","","4","","19","","","19-21 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Still, significant challenges exist in design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labour intensive and complex engineering endeavour.

An organization with hundreds of workstations does not necessarily imply that it has the opportunity to form an ad-hoc computer cluster because different workstations may have different turned-on durations and these workstations may not be available at the same time depending on their users' usage. The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations.

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test. Through trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that our defense mechanism can throttle this DoS attack within a short defense time window while generating few false alarms.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062173","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer science;Information analysis;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Resonance light scattering;Signal generators;Subscriptions;Telecommunication traffic","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;security of data","3G networks;IMS networks;IP multimedia subsystem;chain reaction DoS attack;chained automatic reaction;change-point detection;defense time window;malicious attack;malicious clients;multimedia services;non-parametric GRSh test;online early defense mechanism","","8","","30","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it also induces new security risks to existing and future systems. Intrusion detection is a key technology for security protection. However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed system has good performance in terms of high precision and good real-time capability.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2415763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081762","Anomaly intrusion detection;hidden Markov model (HMM);industrial process automation;multimodel;security","Automation;Control systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Process control;Protocols","control engineering computing;data protection;digital simulation;hidden Markov models;optimisation;pattern classification;process control;security of data","PCS;anomaly intrusion detection system;classifier design;combination simulation platform;field control system;hidden Markov model;industrial process automation;intelligent detection algorithm;multidomain knowledge;performance network engineering tool optimization;process control system;security protection;security risk","","1","","50","","2015-04-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","J. T. L. Ho; G. G. F. Lemieux","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2;9781424437832","978-1-4244-2796-3;9781424427963","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","3","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3;9781467311083","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it is very difficult to prevent wireless sensor network always from malicious attacks so it is always important to detect them as early as possible so that we can react to the attack not harm to wireless sensor network., This paper proposes Distributed Trust based Intrusion Detection (DTBID) approach which considers several factors for establishing trust of sensor node. Most of the research work only considers the communication behavior to derive the trust. Our intrusion detection system will consider trust which is distributed among some other factors such as energy, reliability, data etc. We derive and formulate trust such as direct trust, recommendation trust, and indirect trust from these factors. We provide an approach to decide whether particular node is malicious node or not by comparing subjective trust derived from our intrusion detection technique to that of objective trust which is calculated based on the actual information of each node without considering any network dynamics such as node mobility, trust decay over time, and any malicious attacks. If there is a lot of difference between subjective trust derived from our model to that of objective trust then we consider sensor node as malicious node.","","978-1-4673-7540-5;9781467375405","","10.1109/CCIntelS.2015.7437886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437886","Intrusion Detection;Trust;Wireless Sensor Network","Discrete wavelet transforms;Intrusion detection;Magnetic domains;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","distributed trust based intrusion detection approach;indirect trust;malicious attacks;node mobility;recommendation trust;trust decay over time;wireless sensor network","","","","12","","","7-8 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible. TRR is implemented by changing the Linux dynamic program loader, hence it is transparent to applications. We demonstrate that TRR is effective in defeating real security attacks, including malloc-based heap overflow, integer overflow, and double-free attacks, for which effective prevention mechanisms are yet to emerge.
