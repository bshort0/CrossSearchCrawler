In this paper, a host based intrusion detection system, that uses the idea of tracing system calls, is introduced. As a program runs, it uses the services of the underlying operating system to do some system calls. This system does not exactly need to know the program codes of each process. Normal and intrusive behaviors are collected with gathering the sequences of system calls for each process. Analysis of data is done via data mining and fuzzy techniques. Data mining is used to extract the normal behavior. The proposed system is shown to improve the performance, and decrease size of database, time complexity, and the rate of false alarms.","","978-0-7695-3744-3;9780769537443","","10.1109/IAS.2009.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283792","Data mining;Fuzzy;Operating system;Process-based Intrusion Detection;kernel;system calls","Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Detectors;Fuzzy systems;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Turing machines","data analysis;data mining;security of data","data analysis;data mining technique;fuzzy intrusion detection system;host based intrusion detection system;system calls;time complexity","","2","","9","","","18-20 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection can successfully prevent many attempts to crash network and hamper web services by intruders and hackers. The classification data mining approaches are proposed and used effectively for intrusion detection. However, presences of ambiguous data packets which exhibit traits of two or more classes reduce the overall accuracy of classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity. Further, we also examined whether FCM clustering and RKM clustering can help to determine class of ambiguous packets exactly or approximately.

We describe a protocol, named ""Reliability Map Routing"" (RMR), which uses end-to-end Quality of Service metrics that include spatial reliability and trust. The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection has been studied for approximately 20 years. It is based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions will be detectable. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are usually deployed along with other preventive security mechanisms, such as access control and authentication, as a second line of defense that protects information systems. There are several reasons that make intrusion detection a necessary part of the entire defense system.

This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures.

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","1","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model.

In this article the author presents a new method for counteracting DDoS attacks - firewall rule with token bucket implementation from Quality of Services method. This new concept is different than previous one, because it gives possibility for user to finish they work which was started before the DDoS attack occurs and they do not suffer from DDoS attacks.

This special purpose controller is a parallel and pipelined processor architecture which can deal with the regular expression semantics. Two hardware stacks are implemented in SMPC to support fast branches when the non-matching occurs. Our implementation processes 4 characters per clock cycle (maximum performance of state of the art solutions) and occupies only O(n) memory (where n is the length of the regular expression). Via synthesizing the verilog description and analyzing area/time constraints, SMPC can achieve 200~400 times speedup over traditional CPU implementations and up to 7.9Gbps in processing throughput. Besides it outperforms the counterparts greatly as the complexity of regular expressions increases.","1934-1768;19341768","978-1-4673-2581-3;9781467325813","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6390960","fast branch;regular expression;special purpose controller;string matching","Clocks;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Hardware;Pipelines;Protocols;Throughput","parallel processing;programmable controllers;security of data;string matching;unsolicited e-mail","CPU based system;SMPC controller;area-time constraints;network intrusion detection system;parallel processor architecture;pattern matching;pipelined processor architecture;processing throughput;programmable controller architecture;regular expression semantics;regular expression string matching;spam filtering;virus scanner","","0","","17","","","25-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RTI incorporates a number of innovative design concepts and provides fast, reliable, exploitation-resistant communication and coordination services to the components defending the network, even when challenged by a distributed attack. The architecture can be tailored to provide scalable information assurance defenses for large, geographically distributed, heterogeneous networks with multiple domains, each of which uses different technologies and requires different policies.

MAC implementations such as SELinux and AppArmor come with a default policy including real life and practical rules ready to be used as is or as a basis for a custom policy. In this paper, we first propose an extension of an IDS based on information flow control. We address issues concerning programs execution and improve its expressiveness in terms of security policy. This extended model can be configured to reach a wide variety of different security goals. Particularly, it allows for information flow checking based on users and/or programs dependent policy rules. Furthermore, suspicious modification of binary programs can be detected to avoid malware execution. We also propose an algorithm for deriving an AppArmor MAC policy into an information flow policy, and thus get the advantage of having a ready to use policy offering good security. We finally show a practical example of deriving such a policy in order to configure our IDS.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5962660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962660","","Access control;Containers;Law;Linux;Operating systems","access protocols;invasive software;security of data;telecommunication congestion control","IDS;MAC implementation;MAC policy;binary program;custom policy;information flow checking;information flow control;information flow policy;intrusion detection;malware execution;program dependent policy rule;security goal;security policy","","5","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they have the shortcoming that there are undetectable intrusions according to types for each measure and modeling method because each intrusion type results in anomalies. We propose a multiple-measure intrusion detection method to remedy this drawback of conventional anomaly detectors. We measure normal behavior by system calls, resource usage and file access events and build up profiles for normal behavior with a hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method, which are integrated with a rule-based approach.

However, the tremendous boom of these networks depends incontestably on their reliability in terms of security and quality of services (QoS). In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities.

There are two major aspects to this work: to conduct extensive error injection experiments on the Linux kernel and to quantify the possibility of error-caused security violations using a SAN (Stochastic Activity Network) model. The error injection experiments show that about 2% of errors injected into the firewall code segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations. This indicates that error-caused security vulnerabilities can be a non-negligible source of a security threats to a highly secure system.","","0-7695-1101-5;0769511015","","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028938","","Computer aided instruction;Cryptography;Data security;Error analysis;Hardware;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Storage area networks","Unix;authorisation;computer network reliability;network operating systems;telecommunication security","IPChains;Linux kernel;Netfilter;SAN model;Stochastic Activity Network;error injection;error-caused security vulnerabilities;experiment;firewall data corruption;highly secure system;instruction transient errors;security threat;security violations","","1","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics. Tools in the suite are responsible for a single, well-defined task.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-1828-1;0769518281","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176274","","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer security;Data models;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Monitoring;Network topology;Protection","computer networks;network operating systems;security of data;telecommunication security","NetMap;abstract specification;composable network tools;database;heuristics;incomplete data models;model structure;network configurations;network discovery;network mapping tools;network modeling;network security analysis;scanning techniques;topology","","3","","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks.

Many Intrusion Detection Systems have been proposed to detect these intrusions. However, as the Internet grows day by day, there is a huge amount of data (big data) that needs to be processed to detect intruders. For this reason, intrusion detection has to be done in real-time before intruders can inflict damage, and previous detection systems do not satisfy this need for big data. Using Apache Storm, a Real time Hybrid Intrusion Detection System has been developed in our work. Apache Storm serves as a distributed, fault tolerant, real time big data stream processor. The hybrid detection system consists of two neural networks. The CC4 instantaneous neural network acts as an anomaly-based detection for unknown attacks and the Multi Layer Perceptron neural network acts as a misuse-based detection for known attacks. Based on the outputs from these two neural networks, the incoming data will be classified as ""attack"" or ""normal."" We found the average accuracy of hybrid detection system is 89% with a 4.32% false positive rate. This model is appropriate for real time detection since Apache Storm acts as a real time streaming processor, which can also handle big data.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336370","Apache Storm;CC4 neural network;Hybrid intrusion detection;ISCX 2012 Intrusion dataset;multi-layered perceptron;real time streaming","Fasteners;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Real-time systems;Storms;Training","Big Data;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;multilayer perceptrons;real-time systems;security of data","Apache Storm;CC4 instantaneous neural network;anomaly-based detection;attack data;data classification;distributed-fault tolerant-real time Big Data stream processor;false positive rate;misuse-based detection;multilayer perceptron neural network;normal data;real-time hybrid intrusion detection system;unknown attacks","","","","10","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors.

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

Moreover, in order to use the security patch, rebooting the system is required. Some of systems such as enterprise servers and embedded systems cannot accept the rebooting. Therefore, we propose an external integrity checking system to enhance the OS security.

"Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation","D. Liu; H. Wang; A. Stavrou","","2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","20140922","2014","","","100","111","An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","1530-0889;15300889","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","1","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses.

State-of-the-art NIDS uses deterministic finite automata (DFA) algorithms to perform regular expression matching for its stable matching speed. However, traditional DFA algorithm's throughput is limited by the input character's width (usually one character per time). Although the multi-stride method (process multiple characters per time) can increase the throughput, it leads the DFA transition table to an exponentially increased memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stride regular expression matching engine called PiDFA based on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It applies two methods to solve traditional multi-stride algorithms' memory explosion problem: DFA Transition Merging method and top-k state extraction method. Experiment results show that PiDFA achieves more than 30-fold better performance than original DFA algorithm. Whats more, PiDFA is orthogonal to existing transition table compression algorithms. Implemented with PiDFA algorithm, ClusterFA's matching speed is increased by 6-50 times while maintaining ClusterFA's low memory consumption.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511199","DFA;Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Regular Expression Matching","Clustering algorithms;Compression algorithms;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Merging;Throughput","deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;security of data","ClusterFA matching speed;DPI technology;FPGA;NIDS;PiDFA;deterministic finite automata algorithms;memory consumption;memory explosion problem;multistride method;multistride regular expression matching engine;networking intrusion detection system;top-k state extraction method","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose novel approaches for storage-based intrusion detection and discuss how features of state-of-the-art block storage systems can be used for intrusion detection and recovery of compromised data. In particular we present two prototype systems. First we present a real time intrusion detection system (IDS), which has been integrated within a storage management and virtualization system. In this system incoming requests for storage blocks are examined for signs of intrusions in real time. We then discuss how intrusion detection schemes can be deployed as an appliance loosely coupled with a SAN storage system. The major advantage of this approach is that it does not require any modification and enhancement to the storage system software. In this approach, we use the space and time efficient point-in-time copy operation provided by SAN storage devices. We also present performance results showing that the impact of ID on the overall storage system performance is negligible.

"Data Processing on FPGAs","J. Teubner; L. Woods","","Data Processing on FPGAs","20140702","2013","","","","","Roughly a decade ago, power consumption and heat dissipation concerns forced the semiconductor industry to radically change its course, shifting from sequential to parallel computing. Unfortunately, improving performance of applications has now become much more difficult than in the good old days of frequency scaling. This is also affecting databases and data processing applications in general, and has led to the popularity of so-called data appliances—specialized data processing engines, where software and hardware are sold together in a closed box. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) increasingly play an important role in such systems. FPGAs are attractive because the performance gains of specialized hardware can be significant, while power consumption is much less than that of commodity processors. On the other hand, FPGAs are way more flexible than hard-wired circuits (ASICs) and can be integrated into complex systems in many different ways, e.g., directly in the network for a high-frequency trading application. This book gives an introduction to FPGA technology targeted at a database audience. In the first few chapters, we explain in detail the inner workings of FPGAs. Then we discuss techniques and design patterns that help mapping algorithms to FPGA hardware so that the inherent parallelism of these devices can be leveraged in an optimal way. Finally, the book will illustrate a number of concrete examples that exploit different advantages of FPGAs for data processing.

When compared to wired and base station-based wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider and outsider attacks. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined defense perimeter. In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","1","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets. This technique is then evaluated using a large dataset and the correctness of the classifier is verified by using `area under the receiver operating characteristic curves'(ROC AUC) measures across various string metric-based classifiers.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503226","","","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","honeynets;machine learning method;malicious footprints;malicious network streams;malware;misuse based intrusion detection system;receiver operating characteristic curves measures;security threats;string metric based classifiers","","2","","16","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense. We implemented a proof-of-concept of OverCovert under Linux and evaluated its throughput sending files of different formats.

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

In this approach, the authors propose a novel multi-layer defence mechanisms based on immunity, which is capable of detecting and identifying both known and unknown intrusions, elaborating a specialized response measure. Besides that, the proposed defence mechanisms have the same learning and adaptive capability of the biological immune system, and so it is able to monitor networked computer's activities at different levels, and to improve its response under subsequent exposures to the same attack.

Through virtualization, a physical server can be partitioned into any number of virtual servers running their own operating systems, in their allocated memory, CPU and disk footprints. From the perspective of the user or application on the virtual server, no indication exists to suggest that the server is not a real, physical server.

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators. This paper proposes a tool which should lessen this burden and considerably reduce the workload of having to classify alerts by human beings.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772652","False Alerts;IDS;JRip;Networks;Neuro-Fuzzy;Security","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection","fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","JRip;NEFCLASS;SNORT alerts;behavioral analysis;false alerts;intrusion detection systems;network security;neuro-fuzzy techniques;pattern recognition","","1","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857;10609857","978-1-4577-1349-1;9781457713491","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

Measurements are essential to analyze the performance of wireless protocols such as IEEE 802.11 networks in real environments, but experimentations are complex to perform and analyze. Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we start by an analysis of connection sojourn time distribution of network traffic. Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion.

Our solution is based upon several security levels, event based model, and a simple computational abstraction where an anomaly detection technique is designed to monitor the users' registrations to the operational targeted system, e.g., UNIX-like implementation. In our model, the events' generation model is processed using the Unix Syslog-ng tool, the events' analysis using the Logcheck tool, while the activities of the users and the execution of the both reactive and pro-active events' activities are implemented within an artificial immune and mobile agent based infrastructure. We have implemented and designed our model to differentiate among attacks, security violations, and several other security levels.

In this paper two anomaly intrusion detection methods are proposed for peer-to-peer system. The main characters of the methods are that they can detect intrusion in real-time without any expert knowledge and attack signatures. One method uses hidden Markov model to check reflector DoS attacks, another based on adaptive resonance theory, which can learn the normal behavior with unsupervised method.

However, CAMs are inefficient in matching a numeric range with existing encoding methods.

One-hot and Johnson encodings exhibit poor CAM width scalability O(M). We present a unique hybrid encoding scheme mixing the features of two-hot and Johnson codes to solve both scalability problems.
