Therefore, the ability of an IDS to withstand attack is important in a production system. In this paper, we address the issue of survivable IDS. We begin by categorizing potential vulnerabilities in a generic IDS and classifying methods used to enhance IDS survivability. We then propose an efficient fault tolerance based Survivable IDS (SIDS) along with a systematic way to transform an original IDS architecture into this survivable architecture. Key components of SIDS include: a dual-functionality forward-ahead (DFFA) structure, backup communication paths, component recycling, system reconfiguration, and an anomaly detector.

The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification.

The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of TCAM lookups per payload by m times with the marginally enlarged TCAM size which can be implemented by cascading multiple TCAMs. Due to the reduced number of TCAM lookups, we can easily achieve a multi-gigabit rate for scanning the packet payload. Furthermore, multi-packet inspection is achieved easily by the extended state transition diagram with the shifting distance.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","7","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the investigation of correlativity changes of monitored network features during flooding attacks, this paper employs statistical covariance matrices to build a norm profile of normal activities in information systems and directly utilizes the changes of covariance matrices to detect various flooding attacks. The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks. The evaluation results show that the detection approach can accurately differentiate the flooding attacks from the normal traffic.

The vital signs for blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature measured by sensor nodes would be transmitted to mobile devices of medical staff and system administrator. Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients. Besides, the scheme includes a characteristic of time-bounded, and then the medical staffs can obtain the vital signs without re-authenticating and re-login into the system in a period of time.

The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions.

The current DF models concentrate on reactive investigations, with limited reference to DF readiness and live investigations. However, organizations use DF for other purposes for example compliance testing. The paper proposes that DF consists of three components: Pro-active (ProDF), Active (ActDF) and Re-active (ReDF). ProDF concentrates on DF readiness and the proactive responsible use of DF to demonstrate good governance and enhance governance structures.

The approach relies on a tool, called MNEMOSYNE, that maintains a sliding window containing the traffic that has been recently seen on a network link. MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide incident analysis functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs.

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography). Resulting replicated systems that exhibit nondeterministic behavior, which cannot be handled with conventional replication approaches.

The outside attackers can be prevented with the help of an efficient key management protocol and cryptography. However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4799-3629-8;9781479936298","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty.

The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naïve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7;9781467313667","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When network attacks increase, we simulate human immune system functions to increase the density of antibody; when network attacks decrease, we simulate immune feedback functions and reduce the density of corresponding antibody, restoring it to normal level. By measuring the density of antibody in current system, the danger of network attack in the system can be captured correctly. A new network security evaluation method using antibody concentration to quantitatively analyze the degree of intrusion danger level is presented. And the intrusion detection mechanism based on self-tolerance, clone selection, and immune surveillance is established.

As providers play the central role in cloud security, they need to establish rigorous security measures as a part of their service offerings. In order to limit liabilities for damages caused by the cloud, some form of insurance seems appropriate. For cloud security insurance, however, the question of differential security coverage is relevant as the cost of deploying special protection, detection and response tools varies and requires the coverage estimation. In this paper, we describe a framework to estimate security coverage for different type of service offerings. We have developed software prototype of this framework, called MEGHNAD and tested for various cloud service security requirements. This prototype can serve as a specialized Cloud Doctor in prescribing the right combination of security tools for different cloud services and according to the level of security assurance required.","","978-1-4577-1931-8;9781457719318","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113260","Cloud Insurance;Cloud Services;Security Coverage;Security Tools","Authentication;Fires;Genetic algorithms;Indexes;Insurance;Silicon","cloud computing;customer services;security of data;software prototyping","MEGHNAD;cloud doctor;cloud security insurance;cloud service;damage liabilities;network service;secure cloud environment;security assurance;security coverage estimation;security tool;software prototype development;uninterrupted customer service","","1","","20","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Creating Vulnerability Signatures Using Weakest Preconditions","D. Brumley; H. Wang; S. Jha; D. Song","","20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF'07)","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2819-8;0769528198","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","10","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.","","","","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380646","Overload Control;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);kamailio;server","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Floods;Internet telephony;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;quality of service;resource allocation;signalling protocols","DDoS attack detection;DDoS attack mitigation;Hellinger distance;QoS;SIP load balancer;SIP-based voice over IP network;VOIP network security;distributed denial of service attack;open source kamailio SIP proxy server;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is a challenge because intrusion detection systems built for conventional computer systems tend to be unsuitable. They can be too demanding for resource-restricted cyber-physical systems or too inaccurate due to the lack of real-world data on actual attack behaviours. Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368559","Command injection;Cyber-physical attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decision tree;Denial of service (DoS);Intrusion detection;Mobile robots;Network security","Computer crime;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Robot kinematics;Vehicles","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;decision trees;mobile robots;security of data;telerobotics;vehicles","attack behaviours;automobiles;command injection attacks;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision tree-based detection;denial of service attacks;detection rules;disk data;drones;false positive rate;intrusion detection systems;mobile cyber-physical systems;network traffic;physical input features;physical jittering;power consumption;security;small remote-controlled robotic vehicle","","","","28","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bit-split algorithm allows large hardware state machines to be converted into a form with much higher memory efficiency. We extend the architecture to satisfy the requirements of the IDS state-of-the-art. We show that the architecture can be effectively optimized for FPGA implementation.

IoT uses the Internet as a key infrastructure to interconnect numerous geographically diversified IoT nodes which usually have scare resources, and therefore cloud is used as a key back-end supporting infrastructure. In the literature, the collection of the IoT nodes and the cloud is collectively called as an IoT cloud. Unfortunately, the IoT cloud suffers from various drawbacks such as huge network latency as the volume of data which is being processed within the system increases. To alleviate this issue, the concept of fog computing is introduced, in which foglike intermediate computing buffers are located between the IoT nodes and the cloud infrastructure to locally process a significant amount of regional data. Compared to the original IoT cloud, the communication latency as well as the overhead at the backend cloud infrastructure could be significantly reduced in the fog computing supported IoT cloud, which we will refer as IoT fog. Consequently, several valuable services, which were difficult to be delivered by the traditional IoT cloud, can be effectively offered by the IoT fog. In this paper, however, we argue that the adoption of IoT fog introduces several unique security threats. We first discuss the concept of the IoT fog as well as the existing security measures, which might be useful to secure IoT fog. Then, we explore potential threats to IoT fog.","","","","10.1109/NOF.2015.7333287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7333287","","Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Internet of things;Privacy;Real-time systems;Security;Sensors","Internet of Things;cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","Internet of Things environment;IoT cloud;IoT fog;IoT nodes;back-end cloud infrastructure;back-end supporting infrastructure;cloud infrastructure;communication latency;fog computing;network latency;privacy issues;security issues;security threats","","","","6","","","Sept. 30 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework. The proposed framework focuses three key areas related to defense-in-depth; (1) maximizing synchronization among layered security services (2) modularizing various services for better endpoint security (3) reducing traffic while providing secure mechanism for encrypted updates in traditional networks.

Even a rare vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network security of an entire organisation. Intrusion Detection Systems form an integral component of the mechanisms designed to prevent internet and data communication systems from such attacks. The attacks on the network comprise of information gathering and modification through unauthorized access to resources and denial of service to legitimate users. IDS play a key role in detecting the patterns of behaviour on the network that might be indicative of impending attacks. Majority of groundbreaking research on IDS is carried out on KDD'99 dataset and focuses on either all the attacks in the network or the attacks corresponding to TCP/IP protocol. This paper presents a step forward in this direction where the IDS model addresses a specific part of the network attacks commonly detected at port 7 in UDP. Port scans in UDP account for a sizable portion of the Internet traffic and comparatively little research characterizes security in UDP port scan activity. To meet the growing trend of attacks and other security challenges in the constantly evolving internet arena, this is paper presents a computationally intelligent intrusion detection mechanism using swarm intelligence paradigm, particularly ant colony optimisation, to analyze sample network traces in UDP port scans. This work aims at generating customised and efficient network intrusion detection systems using soft computing to increase general network security through specific network security.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745415","Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO);Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);User Datagram Protocol (UDP);attacks;network security;perpetual echo;port scans","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;transport protocols","Internet traffic;TCP/IP protocol;ant colony optimization;computer network security;computer networks escalating complexity;denial of service;intelligent intrusion detection mechanism;intelligent perpetual echo attack detection;malicious exploitation probability;unauthorized access;user datagram protocol port 7","","0","","18","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem.

So optimization methods using dynamic traffic characteristics are exploited. Our contributions lie in three folds. Firstly, a novel best classification tree is formally defined aiming to minimize the visit cost of the traffic in the slot, based on which optimization methods are exploited. Secondly, Packet Feature Entropy is proposed to measure how efficiently a packet field can partition the traffic, and the popular 14 packet fields used in Snort are investigated in detail by 10Gbps backbone trace and Netflow data.

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","1","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","1934-5070;19345070","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7;9781424400027","978-1-4244-0003-4;9781424400034","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our research focuses on developing such technology. The focus is not only on compression but also on database management through planning and best practice adoption to improve operational efficiency, and provide lower costs, privacy and security. The focus in this summary is on the compression part of the DMBS system for intrusion detection. We present a methodology employing grammar-based and large alphabet compression techniques which involves the generation of multiple dictionaries for compressing clustered subfiles of a very large data file. One of the dictionaries is a common dictionary which models features common to the subfiles. In addition, non-common features of each subfile are modeled via an auxiliary dictionary. Each clustered subfile is compressed using the augmented dictionary consisting of the common dictionary together with the auxiliary dictionary for that subfile.","","978-0-615-15314-8;9780615153148","","10.1109/ITA.2007.4357581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357581","compression;data anonymization;database management;encryption;grammar-based compression;large alphabet;metadata;multiple compression dictionaries;privacy preserving;relational database","Automatic control;Automation;Best practices;Control systems;Costs;Database systems;Dictionaries;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Technology management","data compression;data integrity;data privacy;dictionaries;pattern clustering;security of data;very large databases","data consistency;data integrity;data privacy;data redundancy;database management system;grammar-based compression;intrusion detection compression technology;large alphabet compression;multiple dictionary generation;pattern clustering;very large data file","","0","","7","","","Jan. 29 2007-Feb. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time. At last, the scheme was built in the company's test environment, then the test environment was attacked by penetration test which is to simulate the act of hacking, the feasibility and function of it are verified by the testing.","","","","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502282","Cloud computing;Cloud security;Correlation analysis;Secure Management Scheme;Vulnerability scan","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Correlation;Information security;Servers","Big Data;cloud computing;security of data","Big Data;Nagios;Nikto security tool;Sandcat security tool;Splunk;cloud computing security;correlation analysis;hacker attack detection;information security;regular network security self-testing;secure management scheme;system log collection;test environment;vulnerability scan","","","","27","","","9-10 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must ""port over"" a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain.

In the current research, we present an operation framework and protection mechanism to facilitate a secure environment to protect mobile agents against tampering. The system depends on the presence of an authentication authority. The advantage of the proposed system is that security measures are an integral part of the design, thus common security retrofitting problems do not arise. This is due to the presence of the ElGamal encryption mechanism to protect its confidential content and any collected data by the agent from the visited host. Therefore, eavesdropping on information from the agent no longer reveals any confidential information. Also, the inherent security constraints within the framework allow the system to operate as an intrusion detection system for any mobile agent environment. The mechanism is tested for most well known severe attacks against agents and networked systems. The scheme proved to have promising performance that highly recommends it for the type of transactions that needs highly secure environments, e. g., business to business.","2161-5322;21615322","0-7803-8735-X;078038735X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387089","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Software agents;System testing","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents","ElGamal encryption mechanism;MANET;authentication authority;confidential information;highly secure environments;intrusion detection;mobile agent protection mechanism;secure environment;security constraints;security retrofitting problems","","1","5","18","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
