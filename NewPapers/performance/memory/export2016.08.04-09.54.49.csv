Our major contribution is to provide a revolutionary way to analyze node and network data for patterns, dependence, and effects that indicate network issues. Our first contribution in this vein is to present a method based on utilizing the number of packets sent, number of packets received, node reliability, route reliability, and entropy to develop a synoptic picture of the network health in the presence of a sinkhole.","","","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273661","intrusion detection;neighbor reliability;network health;security;sinkhole;synoptic;wireless;wireless ad hoc","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing;Routing protocols","entropy;security of data","entropy;intrusion alerts;node reliability;route reliability;sinkhole;synoptic level network intrusion detection","","","","14","","","1-5 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In preparation for a course on intrusion detection systems (IDS), the instructor creates pre-configured virtual machines and network trace files for studentspsila use. These virtual machines are then installed by the students on their personal computers at home and used to conduct lab exercises. The virtual lab approach is different from the centralized remote laboratory because students run the lab on their own computers and do not depend on the remote servers. Additionally, the virtual environments allow rapid changes to be made to the lab exercises or environments thus allowing instruction with up-to-date technologies. Furthermore, the burden of maintaining centralized physical labs has been lifted from the institutionpsilas shoulders.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097;15219097","978-1-4577-1875-5;9781457718755","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some redundant sample points and noisy points are firstly removed in this paper according to the distance in high-dimensional feature space. And K-nearest neighbor algorithm guarantees sample points removed is the noise points. Then the remaining sample points provide an SVM with high quality samples that likely to carry most of the support vectors(SVs) such that they maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. Because different network protocols have different attributes, which must affect the detection effect. This paper proposes cooperative network intrusion detection based on SVMs. Three types of detecting agents are generated according to TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol.

Patterns based detectors used in Packet Inspection implement multi-pattern matching algorithms to check whether the packet payload have a specified patterns in a patterns set. Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9;9781467319119","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article explores architectural and software support for an efficient programmable 10 Gigabit Ethernet controller. The design is then extended to support a self-securing Gigabit Ethernet controller that performs intrusion detection on all network data frames. Both raw performance and security require high- bitrate frame data transfer, low-latency metadata access, and intensive computational capacity while still operating under the area, cost, and power budget of a peripheral device. These goals are achieved using a combination of parallel lightweight processing cores, an explicitly-partitioned memory system, and dedicated hardware assists. The firmware on the network interface is designed to utilize these resources efficiently by exploiting frame-level, flow-level, and task-level concurrency.","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/MNET.2007.386466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4277245","","Bit rate;Computer peripherals;Data security;Ethernet networks;Face detection;High performance computing;Intrusion detection;Network interfaces;Network servers;Power system security","local area networks;network interfaces;peripheral interfaces;security of data","Gigabit Ethernet controller;data transfer;explicitly-partitioned memory system;intrusion detection;low-latency metadata access;network data frames;network interface;parallel lightweight processing cores;parallel programmable Ethernet controllers;peripheral device;storage capacity 10 Gbit","","1","","12","","","July-August 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level.

Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device.

In this model, every immune agent owns a small detector set which represents its detection function. After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets. This paper focuses on the immune agents' initialization, detection, evolution and update strategies.

We present experimental results how to use the energy/power consumption logs of a power monitored server as a side-channel that allows us to recognize the exact combination of VMs it currently hosts to a high degree. For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition. As a result, energy consumption data of servers must be protected carefully, as it is potentially valuable information for an attacker trying to track down a VM to mount further attack steps.","","978-1-4673-0006-3;9781467300063","","10.1109/DASC.2011.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119058","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;VM;cloud computing;data centers;energy consumption side channel attack;energy efficiency;energy/power consumption;hardware platform;power measurement device;power monitored server;virtual machines","","6","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An antagonist with a modicum of satellite command system knowledge and modest financial means, could disrupt operations, or, in the worst case, jeopardize the health and safety of orbiting satellites by commanding the satellites into undesirable configurations. Consequently, a critical need has emerged to protect the satellite command systems from malicious or inadvertent interference. Government too, recognizing the need to protect all US space systems, has recently promulgated a policy through the National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee (NTISSC) that declares that future Government use of commercial satellites shall be limited to those using ""accepted techniques necessary to protect the command/control uplink."" The Government policy together with the threat posed by technically astute adversaries has given a strong impetus to commercial satellite operators to protect command systems of their satellites. American Satellite Company (ASC), a leader in providing communications services to Government and businesses, has taken a lead in incorporating a command link protection system on its satellites. The system uses the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to deny access to the satellite command system to anyone but an authorized ASC ground control station.

Botha","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","2011 Information Security for South Africa","20110926","2011","","","1","6","For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","2330-9881;23309881","978-1-4577-1481-8;9781457714818","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

To perform this checking different pattern matching methods are used by NIDS. The most popular method to implement pattern matching is to use of Finite Automata (FA). Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory. However, NFA based pattern matching methods are comparatively takes less memory but the speed of matching is very slow, to overcome these drawbacks of finite automata there are many approaches have been proposed.

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","","978-1-4799-8098-7;9781479980987","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618","Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System","Hafnium;IP networks","Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing","AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN.

This paper presents an online real-time network response system, which can determine whether a LAN is suffering from a flooding attack within a very short time unit. The detection engine of the system is based on the incremental mining of fuzzy association rules from network packets, in which membership functions of fuzzy variables are optimized by a genetic algorithm. The incremental mining approach makes the system suitable for detecting, and thus, responding to an attack in real-time. This system is evaluated by 47 flooding attacks, only one of which is missed, with no false positives occurring. The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection. Moreover, a mechanism for dynamic firewall updating is embedded in the proposed system for the function of eliminating suspicious connections when necessary.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388474","Anomaly detection;firewall;flooding attack;fuzzy association rules;genetic algorithm;membership functions;online incremental mining","Association rules;Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetics;IP networks;Itemsets","","","","0","","28","","","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, extending vehicular networks to include IP connections is still problematic, due in part to the incompatibility of mobile IP handovers with the increased mobility of vehicles. The handover process, consisting of discovery, registration, and packet forwarding, has a large overhead and disrupts connectivity. With increased handover frequency and smaller access point dwell times in vehicular networks, the handover causes a large degradation in performance. This paper proposes a predictive handover protocol, using a combination of a Kalman filter and an online hidden Markov model, to minimize the effects of prediction errors and to capitalize on advanced handover registration. Extensive simulated experiments were carried out in NS-2 to study the performance of the proposed protocol within a variety of traffic and network topology scenarios.

At present, intrusion detection systems have been developed to prevent attacks with accuracy. In this paper, we concentrate on ensemble learning for detecting network intrusion data, which are difficult to detect. In addition, correlation-based algorithm is used for reducing some redundant features. Adaboost algorithm is adopted to create the ensemble of weak learners in order to create the model that can protect the security and improve the performance of classifiers. The U2R and R2L attacks in KDD Cup'99 intrusion detection dataset are used to train and test the ensemble classifiers.

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","2","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

However, in this quest for better performance, little effort has been devoted to making fair performance comparisons among DPIs. Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems.

It additionally suggests that the evaluation of the policies themselves adapt to perceived network threat conditions, possibly affected by the receipt of such audit data by other processes. Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification.

However, it is time-consuming and costly to automatically and efficiently extract log message formats from massive network and security logs of many different types, which are generated by the increasing number of network and security devices and services used in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose log template extraction (LTE), an approach that is semantics aware of network and security logs to address the problem. LTE first cleans log messages and then clusters the cleaned log messages based on the DBSCAN algorithm. At last it infers message templates by LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm. We evaluate our work on massive amount of network log messages collected from a large production network. Experimental results show that LTE approach infers and gets multiple log message formats at the same time with more than 90% accuracy and 100% recall.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357664","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Reverse engineering;Security","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;computer network security;pattern clustering","DBSCAN algorithm;LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm;LTE;large-scale network environments;log template extraction;network anomaly diagnosis;network format extraction;security log message;semantics aware","","","","23","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described. It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier. This approach ensures global optimization of the whole system, and in addition, no population control mechanism is needed.

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT. Carried out experiments showed that our proposed system presents better performance as well as a good scalability compared to the pioneer known centralized IDS SNORT system over real traffic and a set of simulated attacks.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732386","Intrusion detection system;Misuse detection;Mobiles agents;SNORT rules","Computers;Databases;Focusing;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Monitoring","","","","0","","17","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It shows that to represent any interval function of n variables, an SOP with two-valued variables requires up to 2(n-2) products, while an SOP with four-valued variables requires at most n-1 products.

This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate potential associates for collaborative interaction. A distributed, node-centric approach to trust management processes behavior grades into a reputation that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations.

This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We explore the possibility of detecting intrusion at the application level by using rich application semantics. We use short sequences of language library calls as signatures. We consider library call signatures to be more application-oriented than system call signatures because they are a more direct reflection of application code. Most applications are written in a higher-level language with an associated support library such as C or C++. We hypothesize that library call signatures can be used to detect attacks that cause perturbation in the application code. We are hopeful that this technique will be amenable to detecting attacks that are carried out by internal intruders, who are viewed as legitimate users by an operating system.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991561","","Authorization;Availability;Databases;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Monitoring;Object detection;Operating systems;Reflection;Security","authorisation;message authentication;software libraries","application intrusion detection;code perturbation;internal intruders;language library calls;library call signatures;rich application semantics","","8","","8","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591;15301591","978-1-4244-7054-9;9781424470549","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the increased scale of the grid and the new types of information it will transmit introduce security risks that cannot be addressed by traditional, centralized security techniques. We propose a scalable approach inspired by the complex-adaptive control systems of social insects, such as ants and bees. These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources. This paper will provide a brief overview of the Digital Ants framework and then present results from testbed-based demonstrations that show how Digital Ants can identify a cyber security attack scenario against smart meter deployments.","","978-1-4673-4894-2;9781467348942","978-1-4673-4895-9;9781467348959","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497880","Agents;Bio-inspired;Computer security;Cyber security;Smart Grid;Smart meters","Bandwidth;Computer security;Grippers;Load flow;Smart grids;Smart meters","adaptive control;control engineering computing;mobile agents;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","bioinspired cyber security;centralized security techniques;complex-adaptive control systems;digital ant framework;digital pheromones;electric distribution systems;electric power system;interagent communication;limited computational resources;mobile agents;security risks;smart grid deployments;smart meter deployments;social insects;testbed-based demonstrations","","4","","17","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997498","CPS Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Sensory Attacks;Sensory-channel threats","Accelerometers;Malware;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","invasive software","CPS;cyber physical systems;iRobot Create;intrusion detection system;malware;novel computing paradigm;security models;sensory channel threats;sensory channels","","1","","39","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub>σ</sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time.
