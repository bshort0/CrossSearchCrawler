Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network requires realistic modeling of intrusion detection system since most of WSNs are application specific. In WSN, nodes have specific properties such as stable neighbors' information that helps in detection of anomalies in network. Nodes monitor their neighborhood and collaborate with cluster head to detect malicious behavior.

Based on the fact that some of the statistical properties are related to a certain kind of traffic, which is also reflected in the allocation of the dynamic co-occurrence matrix, we are able to display the global status of our network and show periods, where the traffic behaviour is unusual.

In order to address these key issues, we introduce the concept of Activation Patterns.

To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC (peripheral increment sign correlation) method. Then the contour of the object region on a image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3D (three-dimensional) protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary.

As a result, attackers are exploring vectors to attack hypervisors, against which an attack may be executed via several attack vectors such as device drivers, virtual machine exit events, or hyper calls. Hyper calls enable intrusions in hypervisors through their hyper call interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this paper, we characterize the hyper call attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers.

Elasticity is one of the key features of the cloud which makes cloud computing further fashionable. Cloud is still in its infant stages and it faces a wide range of security threats. The security downtime of cloud is relatively slowing down the spreading up of cloud computing. This paper focuses on the security threats faced by the web lets during their migration between the cloud and the mobile devices. Web let migration is an important task during the implementation of elasticity in the cloud. As a primary step, a secure communication channel is designed for the web let migration by deploying secure shell protocol. Herein, the vulnerabilities in some authentication mechanisms are highlighted and a better way of authenticating the web lets with SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is suggested. Finally, managing the traffic effectively in the designed channel with the aid of back pressure technique is also covered in this paper.","","978-1-4673-1986-7;9781467319867","","10.1109/EIDWT.2012.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354763","Authentication;Backpressure;Channel;Migration;Weblets","Authentication;Cloud computing;Communication channels;Mobile handsets;Protocols;Tunneling","cloud computing;trusted computing","SFTP;Weblets;authentication mechanisms;cloud computing;mobile devices;reduced traffic;secure file transfer protocol;securing authentication;security threats;trusted migration","","0","","14","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (stochastic clustering algorithm for network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the incoming audit data and compute the missing values in the audit data.

The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions. Lastly, a preliminary evaluation of the run-time overhead is discussed.","1066-6192;10666192","978-0-7695-3544-9;9780769535449","","10.1109/PDP.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912959","introspection;intrusion detection system;sense of self;static analysis;virtual machines","Condition monitoring;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Protection;Robustness;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","context-free grammars;operating system kernels;program diagnostics;virtual machines","PsycoTrace run-time tool;assertion evaluation;context-free grammar;introspection tool;legal trace;operating system kernel module;source code;static analysis;system call;transparent process self monitoring;virtual machine;virtual process self monitoring","","1","","16","","","18-20 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry. Simulation and characteristics analysis of real rule-sets verify this encoding mechanism's feasibility and efficiency in actual applications.","2159-6301;21596301","978-0-7695-3932-4;9780769539324","978-1-4244-5467-9;9781424454679","10.1109/FCST.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392861","TCAM;entry expansion;packet classification;range matching","Computer science;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;National security;Protection;Quality of service;Routing;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks","computer network security;content-addressable storage;encoding;pattern matching","TCAM;encoding mechanism;entries expansion;network security protection;packet classification;range matching;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common data rate requirement for routers and switches today is 10 Gigabits per second or higher. Also, the networking device requires the flexibility to perform packet forwarding and other complex functions such as firewall and quality of service. The Ethernet switch or router with a network processor can be a solution for these requirements. Also, the Gigabit Ethernet switch is already being deployed in large numbers in both corporate and public data networks, and has begun to move Ethernet from the region of the local area network out to encompass the metro aria network. Especially, the support of the 10 Gb physical port is necessary for the gigabit network devices. This paper presents an implementation of a 10 Gb Ethernet switch hardware platform using a IXP2850 which is the Intel's network processor and a Redhawk which is the Ample Communications' 10 Gb Ethernet MAC. We described the hardware architecture of the implemented 10 Gb Ethernet switch hardware platform which has two 10 Gb XFP (10 gigabit small form-factor pluggable) ports and the software implementation to boot and manage the system.

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions. The FASTER (Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration) project aims at introducing a complete methodology to allow designers to easily implement a system specification on a platform which includes a general purpose processor combined with multiple accelerators running on an FPGA, taking as input a high-level description and fully exploiting, both at design time and at run time, the capabilities of partial dynamic reconfiguration.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1;9781457704581","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4673-4942-0;9781467349420","978-1-4673-4940-6;9781467349406","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times.

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity.

Using the open-source NIDS Snort, we present Elephant, an approach and implementation for updating rule-sets that provides a way to cause Snort to enter a safe quiescent point, load the new rules into memory, and remove the old rules from memory-all while preserving the state that is required to make sure that the NIDS does not miss attacks.

Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching.

In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of a secure routing protocol based on AODV over IPv6, further reinforced by a routing protocol independent intrusion detection system (IDS) for ad hoc networks. Security features in the routing protocol include mechanisms for nonrepudiation and authentication, without relying on the availability of a certificate authority (CA) or a key distribution center (KDC). We present the design and implementation details of our system, the practical considerations involved, and how these mechanisms can be used to detect and thwart malicious attacks. We discuss several scenarios where the secure routing and intrusion detection mechanisms isolate and deny network resources to nodes deemed malicious.

Our research investigates the potential for a self-organizing anomaly detection system inspired by those observed naturally in colonies of honey bees. We provide a summary of findings from a recently presented algorithm for a nonparametric, fully distributed coordination framework that translates the biological success of these methods into analogous operations for use in cyber defense and discuss the features that inspired this translation.

In order to prevent such leakage, we propose the Data Leakage Prevention System (DLPS) which is applied at the entrance of the enterprise network to filter out the outgoing sensitive information. The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB).

Therefore, a range of recent studies have focused on evaluating different machine learning classifiers with the aim of identifying the most appropriate classifier to be used for particular decision making problem-domain. The majority of these studies have used a single dataset within a certain medical-related classification domain. Nevertheless, evaluating machine-learning classifiers with one sample of data appears to be unsatisfying, perhaps it is not reflecting the classifiers capabilities or their behavioral patterns under different circumstances. In this study, five well-known supervised machine-learning classifiers were examined using five different real-world datasets with a range of attributes. The main aim was to illustrate not only the impact of the datasets volume and attributes on the evaluation, but also and more importantly, present the classifiers capabilities and shortcomings under certain conditions, which potentially provide a guidance or instructions to help health analysts and researchers to determine the most suitable classifier to address a particular medical-related decision making problem.","2157-8672;21578672","978-1-4673-8352-3;9781467383523","","10.1109/IWSSIP.2015.7314218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314218","classification accuracy;clinical decision support system;evaluation;machine learning;sensitivity;time complexity","Accuracy;Diseases;Liver;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","decision support systems;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CDSS;behavioral pattern;behavioural pattern;clinical decision support system;decision making problem-domain;health analyst;health care system;machine learning classifier;machine-learning technique;medical application;medical-related classification domain;medical-related decision making;real-world dataset;supervised machine-learning classifier","","","","21","","","10-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","15","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, intrusion detection system is designed to prevent the intruder in the host as well as in network systems. Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT). The proposed CPDT combines Correlation feature selection for selecting features and Partial Decision Tree (PART) for classifying the normal and the abnormal packets. The algorithm is implemented and has been validated within KDD'99 dataset and found to give better results than the existing algorithms.

However, most works pointed out their inefficiency in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we address the inadequacy of decision trees for behavioral anomaly detection. We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4;9780769534954","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","4","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","33","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The reporting propagates from child to parent nodes until it reaches the root. A novel control message, distress propagation object (DPO), is devised to report the anomaly to the subsequent parents and ultimately the edge-router. The DPO message is integrated to routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). The system has configurable profile settings and it is able to learn and differentiate the nodes' normal and suspicious activities without a need for prior knowledge.

Without proper security measures, an enemy can launch various kinds of attacks in hostile environments. These attacks can disrupt the normal working of WSNs and can defeat the purpose of their deployment. Therefore security is an important aspect of these networks. Preventive mechanisms can be applied to protect WSNs against some types of attacks. However, there are some attacks for which there are no known prevention methods. For these cases, it is necessary to use some mechanism of intrusion detection.

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a model for network processors that can aid in evaluating different run-time support systems.
