As it provides strong flexibility, the security in face of attacks to network services becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture to detect intrusion in virtual computing environment and implement a prototype, named VNIDS. In this system, a particular VM is designed to provide intrusion detection services for other VMs. Especially, the rule list can be constructed dynamically for each virtual machine respectively. Moreover, the data detector, which is the core component of VNIDS and isolated from the target virtual machines, has a good view about the state of the target virtual machines. Additionally, in order to transmit the detection information generated by the VNIDS to the target VM, a cross-domain communication module is introduced. Finally, we use a series of intrusion tools to validate VNIDS and the experiment results indicate that it can detect attacks effectively.","2163-5048;21635048","978-1-4244-2584-6;9781424425846","978-1-4244-2585-3;9781424425853","10.1109/IWASID.2008.4688384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4688384","intrusion detection;virtual machine","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","security of data;virtual machines","VNIDS;network intrusion detection system;virtual computing environment;virtual machine;virtualization technology","","0","","19","","","20-23 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","1","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show that intrusion detection can be done based on the assumption that the correlation of system events and parameters is changed during an attack to the system. In this paper, we propose a new method in correlating data and events for ""network based intrusion detection systems"". When an attack occurs, the correlation of security parameters is changed. We propose to use the state of correlation between parameters to detect an attack. First we show how to select effective security parameters for our detection engine with statistical correlation methods. Then, we propose how to build correlation relation graphs (CRG) for the parameters showing higher correlation. Finally we show how the attack may be detected with comparing the CRG parameter pairs for each session with the deviation from the regression line of them.

The traditional way for intrusion prevention is done by pure software solution with high performance CPU. However, this method is out of date, when gigabit network is booming and the high performance throughput is required. In recent years, the programmable hardware solutions have been proposed but they cannot deal with deep and large amount of pattern matching and are lack of flexibility when signatures are growing up. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-matching coprocessor that overcomes the difficulties in TCAM implementation when pattern length is deep and signature set is large.

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset.

While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1;9780989319331","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","1","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest. Additionally, the checkpoint latency of our approach is up to 52% faster than KVM's default method.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846477","Checkpointing;Cloud;Virtualization","Checkpointing;Kernel;Linux;Memory management;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerance;virtual machines;virtualisation","C/R mechanisms;VMI;checkpoint/restart mechanisms;cloud computing environments;fault tolerance;system-level virtualization;virtual machine introspection","","0","","30","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session.

In this paper we present a novel framework, OptiFilter, that mines network packets and host events, based on significant features in intrusion detection. The framework collects network packets and host events continuously in real-time and parses them to a queue of dynamic windows, then it generates connection vectors accordingly. We evaluate the framework in a real-time heterogeneous network and compare it with other benchmark datasets. Our framework shows promising results with minimal processing time for maximum amount of packets.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one solution to encounter such problems. But IDSes are unable to reactive efficiently in encrypted accesses with encryption protocols, because they can not check the contents of a packet. This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation. We show that this system is able to detect various attacks with a high accuracy, by implementing our proposed system on the Snort intrusion detection software and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4244-1691-2;9781424416912","978-1-4244-1692-9;9781424416929","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580619","","Access protocols;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","cryptography;feature extraction;network servers;security of data;transport protocols","DARPA evaluation dataset;SSH protocol;Snort intrusion detection software;TCP traffic;database servers;decipher private information;encrypted accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;encryption protocols;http servers, ftp servers;intrusion signatures;network public servers","","4","","18","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in the mobile area there are many security issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed, let alone been solved. Most of the security mechanisms and techniques used in wired networks tend to rely upon a fixed network topology. For example, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are placed at central points of a network and configured with a model of the network's structure to control and analyse the data flows transferred for harmful content. If at all, adopting these measures for the mobile world is not easy due to its dynamically changing environments and the mobile device's resource constraints that do not allow demanding analyse tasks. In this paper, we present our work in progress of developing a system architecture for cooperative and self-protecting mobile devices. Our approach is based on the assumption that a mobile network can be protected by securing all participating devices or at least all honest participating devices. Thus, we no longer insist on a global view of the network but on several local views. To make these views as precise as possible and to avoid serious performance bottlenecks on a single device we propose a strategy for coupling trusted mobile devices together into a cooperating group","","1-4244-0422-3;1424404223","","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198802","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Network topology;Protection;Virtual private networks","mobile computing;mobile handsets;security of data;telecommunication network topology","cooperative self-protecting mobile devices;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;mobile network;network topology;security issues;trustful relationships","","0","","39","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper tries to exploit some interesting concepts proposed by the new danger theory to overcome the problems associated with the self and non-self model. That by improving NSA in order to achieve better detection rates by integrating the basic danger concepts. In this approach, the intrusion detection is related to the damage that can occur in the system and that can be caused by both external elements such as internal elements.

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","94","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance.

The objective is to detect the adversary as quickly as possible while satisfying certain detection error constraints. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is constructed to systematically analyze the proposed scheme. With the analytical model, we are able to configure the system parameters for guaranteed performance in terms of false alarm rate, average detection delay, and missed detection ratio under a detection delay constraint.

Concerning heavy tails in preprocessing, our study reveals that snort preprocessing times give rise to a cumulative distribution function which is extremely heavy-tailed. Concerning temporal correlations, our analysis reveals that payload processing times evolve in two time scales: a fast time scale and a slow time scale. The fast, packet-to-packet time scale corresponds to 40-100 contiguous packets (a packet group), within which the content matching times are independent. In the slow, packet group-to-packet group time scale the mean values of the successive packet groups are heavily correlated and can be predicted.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9;9781467362399","978-0-7695-4952-1;9780769549521","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures.

Taken in isolation, the individual parts of UNISON encompass features already present in existing systems and infrastructures, however, UNISON combines these into a consistent whole, providing data storage/distribution and messaging/control in a simple, light-weight and unified fashion.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-6695-5;9781424466955","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down. In this paper we present the principle of buffer overflow attacks, a taxonomy of defense methods, the implementation details of RAD, and the performance analysis of the RAD prototype","","0-7695-1077-9;0769510779","","10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918971","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Libraries;Measurement;Program processors;Protection;Prototypes;Taxonomy","program compilers;security of data","RAD;arbitrary programs;binary code;buffer overflow attacks;compile-time solution;compiler patch;network-attached computer system;return address defender;security;stack frames","","38","7","26","","","Apr 2001","16 Apr 2001-19 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of.

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup.

If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks.

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605;15301605","978-0-7695-3450-3;9780769534503","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","7","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The packet is checked by common detection using the common-rule. If this step detects nothing, the packet is forwarded to its destination. If not, it is passed into the extended detection using the group-rule. Through grouping of similar detection rules, the search space and searching time can be greatly minimized. Using the simplified rule in intrusion detection, the packet inspection time can be largely reduced.

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

This requires analyzing various alternative security architectures in order to find a security design that satisfies the organizational security requirements as well as the business constraints. In this paper, we present ConfigSynth, an automated framework for synthesizing network security configurations by exploring various security design alternatives to provide an optimal solution. The main design alternatives include different kinds of isolation patterns for traffic flows in different segments of the network. ConfigSynth takes security requirements and business constraints along with the network topology as inputs. Then it synthesizes optimal and cost-effective security configurations satisfying the constraints. ConfigSynth also provides optimal placements of different security devices in the network according to the given network topology. ConfigSynth uses Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for modeling this synthesis problem. We demonstrate the scalability of the tool using simulated experiments.","1063-6927;10636927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2013.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681625","automatic synthesis;constraints;formal logic;security configuration","Business;Equations;Mathematical model;Network topology;Payloads;Security;Usability","Internet;authorisation;business data processing;computability;computer network security;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","ConfigSynth;Internet services;SMT;access deny;alternative security architectures;business constraints;enterprise budget constraints;enterprise networks;formal framework;heterogeneous isolation patterns;network security configuration synthesis;network security design synthesis;network topology;optimal security configurations;organizational security requirements;payload inspection;resource access control;satisfiability modulo theories;security threats;synthesis problem modeling;traffic flows;trusted communication","","1","","15","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2339-0;0769523390","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","8","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy consumed by the device. In this perspective, this paper aims to spot malware covertly exchanging data using two detection methods based on artificial intelligence tools, such as neural networks and decision trees.

The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other evolutionary-based techniques.","","978-1-4244-7859-0;9781424478590","978-1-4244-7857-6;9781424478576","10.1109/NAFIPS.2010.5548289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548289","evolutionary computation;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithms;network intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation","Internet;computer network;evolutionary based system;evolutionary optimization;fuzzy rule based network intrusion detection system;malicious agent;mobile network","","1","","18","","","12-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thomas Friedman theorized that technology has leveled or “flattened” the global playing field that once existed. This flattening has happened as a result of what he calls the “triple convergence” of platform, process and people. However, there is a general lack of understanding about how to describe, assess the complex and dynamic nature of cyber security related information to improve overall cyber security task performance. Ever since the first computer virus traversed the Internet it has been apparent that attacks can spread rapidly across national boundaries. This paper presents research that utilize bioinformatics techniques, to forecast cyber security attacks by identifying emerging threats based on analysis of computer infection, and incursions models based on human disease models.","","978-1-4577-1375-0;9781457713750","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107851","cyber security;intrusion detection;security","Biological system modeling;Computer security;Computers;Immune system;Intrusion detection","Internet;bioinformatics;computer viruses;national security","Internet;attack modeling;attack predictive analysis;attack visualization;bioinformatics technique;computer infection analysis;computer virus;cyber infrastructure-oriented system;cyber security attack forecasting;cyber security related information;cyber security task performance;cyber security threat;emerging threat identification;human disease model;imminent attack identification;incursions model;national boundaries;potential attack identification;system deterrence;system protection","","3","","20","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optical Fiber Sensors in Physical Intrusion Detection Systems: A Review","G. Allwood; G. Wild; S. Hinckley","Centre for Communications and Electronics Research, School of Engineering, Edith Cowan University, Perth, WA, Australia","IEEE Sensors Journal","20160616","2016","16","14","5497","5509","Fiber optic sensors have become a mainstream sensing technology within a large array of applications due to their inherent benefits. They are now used significantly in structural health monitoring, and are an essential solution for monitoring harsh environments. Since their first development over 30 years ago, they have also found promise in security applications. This paper reviews all of the optical fiber-based techniques used in physical intrusion detection systems. It details the different approaches used for sensing, interrogation, and networking, by research groups, attempting to secure both commercial and residential premises from physical security breaches. The advantages and the disadvantages of the systems are discussed, and each of the different perimeter protection methods is outlined, namely, in-ground, perimeter fence, and window and door protection. This paper reviews the progress in optical fiber-based intrusion detection techniques from the past through to the current state-of-the-art systems and identifies areas, which may provide opportunities for improvement, as well as proposing future directions in this field.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2535465","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7421944","In-ground;Optical Fiber;Perimeter Fence;Physical Intrusion Detection;Physical intrusion detection;Security;in-ground;optical fiber;perimeter fence;security","Adaptive optics;Optical fiber sensors;Optical fibers;Security","","","","","","114","","2016-02-29","July15, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
