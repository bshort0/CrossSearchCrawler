However, there is a performance bottleneck for multi-pattern matching on online compressed network traffic(CNT), this is because malicious and intrusion codes are often embedded into compressed network traffic. In this paper, we propose an online fast and multi-pattern matching algorithm on compressed network traffic (FMMCN). FMMCN employs two types of jumping, i.e. jumping during sliding window and a string jump scanning strategy to skip unnecessary compressed bytes. Moreover, FMMCN has the ability to efficiently process multiple large volume of networks such as HTTP traffic, vehicles traffic, and other Internet-based services. The experimental results show that FMMCN can ignore more than 89.5% of bytes, and its maximum speed reaches 176.470MB/s in a mid-range switches device, which is faster than the current fastest algorithm ACCH by almost 73.15 MB/s.","1673-5447;16735447","","","10.1109/CC.2016.7489982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489982","compressed network traffic;depth of boundary;multiple pattern matching;network security;skip scanning","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Dictionaries;Pattern matching;Security;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles","Internet;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","ACCH;FMMCN;HTTP traffic;Internet;Internet-based services;compressed network traffic;fast multipattern matching algorithm;high-speed network traffic analysis;intrusion codes;malicious behaviors;malicious codes;multipattern matching;online compressed network traffic;vehicles traffic","","","","","","","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition to cryptography based protective techniques such as authentication and authorization, several defense measures, like Intrusion Detection and Tolerance, and tools are employed to protect networks thereby, making security a critical issue. Therefore, the need for defining, structuring, and quantifying security arises as a necessary first step towards measuring the effectiveness of security related deployments. This work proposes a structured approach to define and analyze security related metrics for intrusion tolerant systems for each individual host in the network and compose them in a meaningful way to provide an overall security quantification for a network. The dynamics of each machine against a particular vulnerability is modeled as a (hidden) Markov process to capture uncertainties in attacker's action and system response. Based on these stochastic analysis, security metrics of each machine are calculated which are subsequently used in the final computation of the security metrics of the network.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4244-5487-7;9781424454877","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431978","Markov process;Network security;hidded Markov model;intrusion detection system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probabilities;vulnerabilities","Application software;Authentication;Authorization;Computer networks;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protection;Uncertainty","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;hidden Markov models;message authentication;probability;stochastic processes","computer network;cryptography based protective technique;hidden Markov process;intrusion detection;intrusion tolerant system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probability;stochastic analysis","","1","","15","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose in this paper a technique for selecting relevant features out of KDD99 using a hybrid approach toward an optimal subset of features. Unlike existing work that only detect attack or no attack conditions, our approach efficiently identifies which sort of attack each register in the dataset refers to.

An important step for the investigation or even prevention of these breaches is to normalize and analyze security-related log events from various systems in the target network. However, the number of log events produced in big IT landscapes can grow up to multiple billions per day. Current log management solutions, e.g., Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), cannot even closely normalize such huge amounts of data and therefore disable the tracking of attacks in real-time, which means that the log data remains unusable for attack analysis. In this paper, we present an approach to fully normalize event logs in high-speed by making use of established high-performance inter-thread messaging in conjunction with a hierarchical knowledge-base of log formats and parallel processing on multiple low-end systems. Using our approach, we are able to process more than 250,000 events/sec on relatively low-profile machines and can therefore easily handle more than 20 billion events/day, which is enough to handle average and peek loads of log events from big enterprise networks.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410270","event logs;inter-thread messaging;network security;normalization","Companies;Concrete;Instruction sets;Knowledge based systems;Parallel processing;Receivers;Security","parallel processing;security of data","IT landscapes;SIEM;big enterprise networks;distributed normalization;hierarchical knowledge-base;high-performance interthread messaging;instant attack analysis;log management solutions;low-profile machines;parallel normalization;parallel processing;real-time attack tracking;security breach prevention;security information and event management;security-related log event analysis","","","","18","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need to use ever more effective data transmission media with specific communication interfaces brought about the creation of a brand new management structure within electrical power systems called the Smart Grid. In most cases, the architecture of this system, in terms of teleinformation connectivity, is based on proven solutions from the 90s, and communication interfaces and protocols have been undergoing very dynamic development in the recent years. Integration of these two systems is often quite problematic, especially to beginner computer network administrators and automation specialists responsible for the development of a medium and low voltage electrical power grid. Despite a grid's system and components being correctly physically connected, their logical structure is often misguided and causes serious communication problems, and puts the entire system at risk of being compromised in case of an attack. The article touches upon the issues of addressing interfaces of typical electromagnetic devices available on the market, and the rules of design and segmentation of teleinformation logical networks.","","","","10.1109/EPE.2016.7521716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521716","addressing logical networks;communication interface;computer networks;internet protocol;transmission medium","Broadcasting;Data communication;IP networks;Optical switches;Protocols;Smart grids","","","","","","","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This will make cloud computing a potential target for cyber attacks. Most proposed security models for virtualization are working above virtualization on host OS. Almost all proposed cloud security models suffers from this problem in that these models have very limited control over virtualization. In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

Most of them scarcely try to combine the two issues together to propose an integrated solution, which is employed to defend the pivotal data and to recover the data when the intrusion has taken place. In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401","","Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols","digital storage;file organisation;security of data","IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems","","1","","16","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927;10636927","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","0-7695-2837-3;0769528373","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Applications of Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams","T. Sasao; J. T. Butler","","Applications of Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams","20141217","2014","","","","","A zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZDD) is a data structure to represent objects that typically contain many zeros. Applications include combinatorial problems, such as graphs, circuits, faults, and data mining. This book consists of four chapters on the applications of ZDDs. The first chapter by Alan Mishchenko introduces the ZDD. It compares ZDDs to BDDs, showing why a more compact representation is usually achieved in a ZDD. The focus is on sets of subsets and on sum-of-products (SOP) expressions. Methods to generate all the prime implicants (PIs), and to generate irredundant SOPs are shown. A list of papers on the applications of ZDDs is also presented. In the appendix, ZDD procedures in the CUDD package are described. The second chapter by Tsutomu Sasao shows methods to generate PIs and irredundant SOPs using a divide and conquer method. This chapter helps the reader to understand the methods presented in the first chapter. The third chapter by Shin-Ichi Minato introduces the ""f ontier-based"" method that efficiently enumerates certain subsets of a graph. The final chapter by Shinobu Nagayama shows a method to match strings of characters. This is important in routers, for example, where one must match the address information of an internet packet to the proprer output port. It shows that ZDDs are more compact than BDDs in solving this important problem. Each chapter contains exercises, and the appendix contains their solutions.

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems. The suite of detection technologies was integrated and connected to a commercial security event correlation framework from ArcSight. We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments. We particularly focused on detection, correlation, and visualization of a network traversal attack, where an attacker penetrates successive network layers to compromise critical assets that directly control the underlying process. Such an attack is of particular concern in the layered architectures typical of control system implementations.","","978-1-4244-7551-3;9781424475513","978-1-4244-7549-0;9781424475490","10.1109/PST.2010.5593242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593242","alert correlation;anomaly detection;control system security;critical infrastructure security;intrusion;security information event management","Control systems;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Process control;Servers","security of data","DATES;commercial security event correlation framework;cyber attack;digital control systems;intrusion detection technologies;network traversal attack","","5","1","22","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a fast and simple approach, the Fuzzy ESVDF algorithm produces an efficient features set and, thus, provides an effective solution to the dimensionality reduction problem in general.

Many of the sandboxing systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, a problem in existing sandboxing systems is the amount of overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a sandboxing system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a sandboxed application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application.

Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives.

Our approach is based on a simple yet powerful analogy from the innate part of the human immune system, the Toll-Like Receptors. We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system. For our model to work, we propose the creation of a taxonomy of the digital Acytota, based on which our receptors are created.","2162-2108;21622108","978-0-7695-3329-2;9780769533292","978-0-7695-3329-2;9780769533292","10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4622596","Anomaly Detection;SOM;TLR","Computer science;Computer security;Concrete;Detectors;Forensics;Humans;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Uncertainty","security of data","anomaly detection;digital Acytota;information security;suspicion-threat-and danger risk;toll-like receptor;uncertain risk","","0","","14","","","25-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An integrated security framework requires a careful consideration of the security features of the network within an airplane. Potentially, the aircraft could consist of three kinds of networks namely passenger network, crew network, and control network. The security protocol implemented must ensure a proper separation of these networks and also watch for any security protocol violations. In this paper, the authors review the existing aircraft data network standards, security provisioning, and the security threats associated with the aircraft data networks.

Symposium on","20081117","2005","","","203","210","Hashing algorithms have been widely adopted to provide a fast address look-up process which involves a search through a large database to find a record associated with a given key. Modern examples include address-lookup in network routers for a forwarding outgoing link, rule-matching in intrusion detection systems comparing incoming packets with a large database, etc. Hashing algorithms involve transforming a key inside each target data to a hash value hoping that the hashing would render the database a uniform distribution with respect to this new hash value. When the database are already key-wise uniformly distributed, any regular hashing algorithm would easily lead to perfectly uniform distribution after the hashing. On the other hand, if records in the database are instead not uniformly distributed, then different hashing functions would lead to different performance. This paper addresses the case when such distribution follows a natural negative linear distribution, which is found to approximate distributions in many various applications. For this distribution, we derive a general formula for calculating the distribution variance produced by any given non-overlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing function. Such a distribution variance from the hashing directly translates to performance variations in searching. In this paper, the best XOR hashing function is determined for any given key size and any given hashing target size.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","10.1145/1095890.1095919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675280","address lookup;computer networks;hashing;internet;intrusion detection;network security;packet matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed databases;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Permission;Secure storage","computer networks;file organisation;information retrieval;statistical distributions","computer network;large database search;linearly distributed address lookup;natural negative linear distribution;nonoverlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing algorithm;uniform distribution","","2","","10","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1;9781424475261","978-0-7695-4107-5;9780769541075","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses a method for accelerating the network policing using node capabilities. Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes.

After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations.

Intrusions attempts are blocked based on (1) a serious attack that has already occurred (2) rate of packet flow (3) prediction of possible serious intrusions and (4) online risk assessment of the assets possibly available to the intruder. The focus of this paper is on the distributed monitoring of intrusion attempts, the one step ahead prediction of such attempts and online risk assessment using fuzzy inference systems. Preliminary experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is efficient for real time distributed intrusion monitoring and prevention.","","0-7695-2876-7;0769528767","978-0-7695-2876-2;9780769528762","10.1109/IAS.2007.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299772","","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","Markov processes;fuzzy set theory;risk management;security of data","advanced network monitoring;distributed intrusion prediction;distributed intrusion prevention system;fuzzy inference systems;hidden Markov models;large network;online fuzzy risk assessment;packet flow rate","","9","","9","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-4498-4;9781424444984","","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research introduced a parallel intrusion detection system based on GPGPU and Open Computing Language (OpenCL), that processes incoming packets concurrently, thus increasing system capacity in a high throughput environment. The experiment result shows that performance of GPU-based design is improved on the average of 58.73x against a single-thread central processing unit (CPU) implementation, and on the average of 13.53x against a multi-thread implementation.

The main security concern for e-business is Web application security. Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks. In this paper, the author studies state-of-the-art techniques and research related to web attack detection: the author analyses and compares different methods of web attack detections and summarizes the most important factors for Web attack detection independent of the type of vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we propose a novel memory architecture using perfect hashing to condense state transition tables without hash collisions. The proposed memory architecture achieves up to 99.5% improvement in memory reduction compared to the traditional two-dimensional memory architecture.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To overcome the vulnerabilities of network security researchers have come up with different frameworks of intrusion detection system using data mining. Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier.

In particular, the set packing algorithm is used to optimize the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a trust node aware optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing in the communications of the nodes. Also, an algorithm to identify new trust node(s) is presented to address the fault tolerance requirement of the smart grid system.

Based on these methods, we establish calculating models of numeric and non-numeric danger signals separately, finally give the definition and calculating method of ""danger degree"".","","978-0-7695-3778-8;9780769537788","","10.1109/ICMeCG.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280069","Artificial Immune System;Danger Sensed;Information Security;Intrusion Detection","Artificial immune systems;Clouds;Computer science;Conference management;Data analysis;Electronic government;Information security;Intrusion detection;Numerical models;Statistical analysis","artificial immune systems;operating systems (computers);security of data","Windows process intrusion detection;artificial immune system;computer system;danger theory model;method-of-classified danger sensed","","0","","8","","","16-19 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WAIM '08. The Ninth International Conference on","20080812","2008","","","591","597","Information infection and information leakage in computer systems are mainly caused by insecure network access. Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Miller","Department of EE & CSE, Penn State University, USA","2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","20080716","2007","","","1","7","Zero-day attacks - especially those that hide the attack exploit by using code obfuscation and encryption - remain a formidable challenge to existing network defenses. Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted in exceeding 90% mean accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate.","","1-4244-0705-2;1424407052","","10.1109/CIDM.2007.368873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221297","","Computational intelligence;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Delay;File systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Software packages","data mining;invasive software","World Wide Web;background application activity;computer behavior;computer configurations;computer measurements;computer worm detection;data mining;feature selection","","1","","31","","","March 1 2007-April 5 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite all the hype surrounding SDNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding. Security is still the key concern and is an equally striking challenge that reduces the growth of SDNs. Moreover, the deployment of novel entities and the introduction of several architectural components of SDNs pose new security threats and vulnerabilities. Besides, the landscape of digital threats and cyber-attacks is evolving tremendously, considering SDNs as a potential target to have even more devastating effects than using simple networks. Security is not considered as part of the initial SDN design; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses the state-of-the-art security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We classify the security solutions in the literature by presenting a thematic taxonomy based on SDN layers/interfaces, security measures, simulation environments, and security objectives. Moreover, the article points out the possible attacks and threat vectors targeting different layers/interfaces of SDNs. The potential requirements and their key enablers for securing SDNs are also identified and presented. Also, the article gives great guidance for secure and dependable SDNs.

Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers.

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs. We evaluate this design through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2418434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090949","Data mining;insider attack;intrusion detection and protection;system call (SC);users' behaviors","Computers;Data mining;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-04-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules. The experimental results show that the pre-processing time for 50000 rules is shorter than 0.051s, the average speed of rule-header classification for Snort IDS is higher than 10 Gbps.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4673-5740-1;9781467357401","978-1-4673-5741-8;9781467357418","10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496433","Binary tree;FPGA;NIDS;Packet classification","Binary trees;Clocks;Decision trees;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks","IP networks;computer network security;parallel processing;pattern classification;pipeline processing;telecommunication network routing;tree data structures","CPU;FPGA;IP packet;NIDS;Snort IDS;binary tree structure;binary-tree-based high speed packet classification system;hardware circuit;high performance embedded networking application;network intrusion detection system;next-generation packet classification;packet header division;parallel processing;pipeline processing;processor performance;router;rule-header classification;serial program execution;software-based packet classification;tree node","","2","","10","","","28-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously.
