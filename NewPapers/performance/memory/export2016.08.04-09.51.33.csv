Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","978-1-4244-7628-2;9781424476282","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore security in Wireless Sensor Network WSNs is challenging and critical to the functionality of the networked sensors. This is very important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is known for limitations on hardware and software and for resources-constrained in general. An adaptive model of security that meets requirements and constraints in WSN is Intrusion Detections.

Introducing a modification of a protocol or any new protocol in such a flexible infrastructure implies a novel management approach incorporating network monitoring equipment with reconfigurable architecture. The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring. We present the architecture focusing on the system-level integration of specific packet processors. The integration of processing building blocks into one high performance system has great challenges.

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ldquoUser Contributed Designsrdquo at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ldquoopen-source hardwarerdquo platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming-and more error prone-than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.","","978-1-4244-4407-6;9781424444076","978-1-4244-4406-9;9781424444069","10.1109/MSE.2009.5270838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270838","","Acoustic testing;Education;Ethernet networks;Internet;Open source hardware;Open source software;Process design;Software design;Software standards;Solids","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;open systems;user centred design","NetFPGA platform;NetFPGA repository;NetFPGA.org;developer-community;integrated testing;networking systems;open-source hardware platform;reusable modules;reusable network hardware design;software oriented open-source projects;user contributed designs","","0","","7","","","25-27 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6;9781467315906","978-1-4673-1589-0;9781467315890","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic. Our scheme inflicts extremely low collateral damage to legitimate traffic while quickly detecting and selectively filtering attack traffic.","","978-1-4673-3149-4;9781467331494","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394683","Anomaly Detection;DDoS;TCP SYN Attack;collateral damage;packet marking;selective filtering","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Limiting;Routing;Servers;Topology","IP networks;computer network security;protocols;telecommunication traffic","Eagle Eyes;IP spoofing;TCP SYN attack;attack packet filtering;attack traffic filtering;collateral damage reduction;distributed denial of service attacks;dropping attack packets;excess traffic dropping;flooding based DDoS Attacks;protocol independent packet marking scheme;rate limiting schemes","","0","","18","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Comparing with other related algorithms, the main improvement of this algorithm is that it process patterns in the form of natural language instead of formal patterns. This algorithm's correctness is strictly proved and its time complexity is linear.

Intrusion detection systems have traditionally been based on the characterization of a user and tracking of activity of the user to see if it matches that characterization. Artificial neural networks provide a feasible approach to model complex engineering systems such as intrusion detection. Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel version of the back propagation training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks that are used for detecting intruders based on the MPI standard on Linux PC clusters.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes.

Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for mining alerts of NIDS output report log for automatically predicting the severity of attack revealed by those alerts using data mining classification techniques. Our framework automatically detects the attack severity using the type of the suspicious traffic detected by NIDS as a feature. Hence it can save the time spent to manually analyze the log file of NIDS in order to categorize various types of captured suspicious traffic in view of the detected severity of attack. Moreover, it can help the network security administrator to create policy rules that take immediate action against the detected network attack based on its predicted severity. The experimental results show that our approach can correctly predict the severity of attack for more than 99.2% of alerts samples included in log output report of the deployed NIDS.","","","","10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492742","data mining;log file alerts;network intrusion detection","Cleaning;Communication networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training","","","","","","29","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the contrary, BIOS of new computer systems (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices, and other embedded systems) can be easily upgraded using a flash or capsule mechanism which can add new vulnerabilities either through malicious code, or by accidental incidents, and deliberate attack. The recent attack on Iranian Nuclear Power Plant (Stuxnet) [1:2] is an example of advanced persistent attack. This attack vector adds a new dimension into the information security (IS) spectrum, which needs to be guarded by implementing a holistic approach employed at enterprise level. Malicious BIOS upgrades can also cause denial of service, stealing of information or addition of new backdoors which can be exploited by attackers for causing business loss, passive eaves dropping or total destruction of system without knowledge of user.

In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes.

Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware.

However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a simple solution called ""Buttercup"" to counter against attacks based on buffer-overflow exploits (such as CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster). We have implemented our idea in SNORT, and included 19 return address ranges of buffer-overflow exploits.

Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","2325-5552;23255552","0-7803-9569-7;0780395697","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","17","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity. Unfortunately, these strategies are not directly applicable to WSNs since ad-hoc networks are not as resource constrained as WSNs.This paper tries to develop distributed algorithms for detecting anomalous activity in information flow patterns in large-scale sensor networks.

To address the problem of identifying these servers, in this paper a new approach to rapidly and reliably identify these cloud hosting computer systems is presented. In the outlined approach, a handheld device composed of an embedded computer combined with a method of undetectable interception of Ethernet based communications is presented.

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report.

Many established outlier detection methods are designed to search for low-density objects in a static data set of vectors in Euclidean space. For trend detection, high volume events are of interest and the data set is constantly changing. These two problems appear to be very different at first. However, they also have obvious similarities.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2;9781424427772","978-1-4244-2778-9;9781424427789","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","23","3","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682703","bot;fingerprinting;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Conferences;Detectors;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","IDS;VMM;active bot fingerprinting;active detection approaches;bot behavior profiles;cloud security;cooperative botnet detection;cooperative botnet profiling;enterprise;guest OS;malicious jobs;malware;passive detection approaches;virtual machine monitor;virtualized environment","","1","","22","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental result on KDD99 intrusion detection datasets shows that this RBFNN using the novel hybrid algorithm has high detection rate while maintaining a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-1685-1;9781424416851","978-1-4244-1686-8;9781424416868","10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4525415","","Clustering algorithms;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Radial basis function networks","computer networks;evolutionary computation;gradient methods;particle swarm optimisation;radial basis function networks;security of data;telecommunication security","RBF neural network;evolutionary algorithm;gradient descent algorithm;hybrid QPSO;intrusion detection;network anomaly detection;quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization;radial basis function neural network","","3","","14","","","6-8 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modelbased thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observed thermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.","2168-7161;21687161","","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274707","Anomaly detection;green datacenters;heat imbalance;high-performance computing;virtualization","Cooling;Heating;Histograms;Servers;Temperature measurement;Thermal sensors","","","","","","","","2015-09-23","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well.

Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats.

A selfish node does not directly intent to damage other nodes with active attacks but it simply does not cooperate in network operation, saving battery life for its own communication. The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed. This paper we deal with misbehaving nodes in MANETs that drop packets supposed to be relayed, whose purpose may be either saving their resources or launching security attacks. We propose a new solution to monitor, detect and safely exclude the misbehaving node planned around six modules.","","978-1-4577-0588-5;9781457705885","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972464","MANET;Reputation;Security;Selfish Node;Trust","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;active attack;battery life;k-neighbourhood local reputation system;network operation;network performance;routing misbehaviour mitigation;security attack;selforganizing mobile ad hoc network;wireless mobile ad hoc network","","1","","23","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, in addition to producing alerts, it should allow for easy insertion of new detection algorithms. It should also support dynamic selection and de-selection of detection algorithms, and it should adjust its resource consumption to the current need. Such a system would allow the operator to easily extend the system when new detection algorithms become available. It would also allow the operator to maintain a low-cost monitoring baseline and perform more extensive monitoring when it is required. In this paper we propose an architecture for intrusion detection which aims at providing the operator with this support. The architecture uses a modular design to promote a high degree of flexibility. This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data. To illustrate the feasibility of the architecture, we provide a proof - of-concept supporting monitoring of users for insider detection and webserver monitoring for intrusion attempts.","","978-0-7695-3324-7;9780769533247","","10.1109/IAS.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627079","adaption;intrusion detection;operator-centric;sensor reconfiguration;system architecture","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Computer science;Computer security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Quality of service;Sensor systems","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;insider detection;low-cost monitoring baseline;modular design;operator-centric intrusion detection;sensor reconfiguration mechanism;webserver monitoring","","0","","22","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The infrastructure implements services for the transfer, execution, and protection of mobile agents. Security services are usually provided by implementing new security mechanisms that are explicitly tailored to mobile components. Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms. Also, by describing the security of the mobile code system in terms of the OS security mechanisms, system administrators can better evaluate the security implications of deploying the system. This paper describes the design and implementation of our system and compares its performance to several existing mobile code systems.","","0-7695-2284-X;076952284X","","10.1109/ICECCS.2005.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467904","Mobile Agent Security;Mobile Code;OS Security","Collaborative software;Computer science;Computer security;History;Java;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Network servers;Operating systems;Protection","mobile agents;mobile communication;object-oriented programming;operating systems (computers);security of data","OS security mechanism;OS-level mechanism;autonomous mobile components;mobile agents;mobile code security;mobile code systems;operating system;security services","","0","","20","","","16-20 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RVM algorithm needs less relevance vectors (RVs) (support vectors (SVs) in SVM) and it has better generalization ability than SVM. In order to get better classifier in anomaly detection, we analyze and model RVM algorithm using KDD99 dataset. Firstly, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors to enable better analysis of the data. Secondly, a multi-classification intrusion detection model based on relevance vector machine is designed to match these features. Finally, the matching forecast results of this model are achieved.

However, with the significant development of network technologies, the current IDS architecture does not support high-speed communications. Therefore, improving the performance of IDS is a major concern for researchers. In this paper, we present a model of intrusion detection based on the classification of network connections. Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold. This threshold can be adjusted by the updating process of the classification model.","","978-1-4244-6726-6;9781424467266","","10.1109/ICIMP.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476902","classification;filtering;high-speed intrusion detection;learning","Degradation;Delay;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","pattern classification;security of data","IDS architecture;error threshold tolerance;high-speed networks;intelligent loss principle;intrusion detection systems;network connection classification","","1","","18","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency. With IPC-based SSE implementation, the traditional L2 switches can now provide content security service in a very cost effective way.","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577789","","Cost function;Delay;Engines;Ethernet networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Security;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","local area networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","gigabit Ethernet interface;intrusion detection and prevention system;network security switch architecture;packet deep inspection;security service engine","","1","","10","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","2155-7578;21557578","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","2","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these needs are traditionally provided through methods of channel encryption and signing, such mechanisms are often difficult or impossible to implement in the ad-hoc, decentralized environments seen in sensor networks, collaborative intrusion detection systems, or other similar peer-to-peer networks. Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message. Although our proposed mechanisms are likely implemented without difficulty from a network and encryption standpoint, they do require significant integration and awareness within the applications relying on them. The method also assumes a static value from a large existing set of shared knowledge, which does not always exist.","","978-1-4577-0980-7;9781457709807","978-0-7695-4459-5;9780769544595","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032224","hashing;secure communications;shared knowledge","Ad hoc networks;Complexity theory;Encryption;Knowledge engineering;Receivers","ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","ad-hoc communication;ad-hoc environment;ad-hoc security;channel encryption;channel signing;collaborative intrusion detection system;complexity hash function;decentralized communication network;language-derived relevance theory;message complexity;message confidentiality;message integrity;message-based communication network;one-way cryptographic hashing mechanism;one-way hashing;peer-to-peer network;salted hash;secure communication;sensor network","","1","","29","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
