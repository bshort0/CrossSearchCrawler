This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm. By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic.

Here, the term `bad character' is a character that causes a mismatch. While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns. From the theoretical analysis, the authors validate the correctness of the BLAST algorithm. Also, from the experimental results across different setups, the authors show that the BLAST algorithm provides the faster search time than the other algorithms. For example, the authors obtain an enhancement by as much as 212.41% on average for various numbers of attack patterns and attack traffic conditions compared with that of the modified Wu-Manber algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the BLAST algorithm drastically reduces the amount of memory required for constructing the shift table based on a MBSU from 64 KB to 1 KB.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2011.0305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587875","","","computer network security;search problems;string matching;text analysis","B-layered bad-character SHIFT tables;BLAST algorithm;MBSU;Wu-Manber algorithm;attack patterns;attack traffic conditions;byte checking;high-speed pattern matching;multibyte search unit;multipattern matching algorithm;pattern search time;shift values;single bad-character SHIFT table;single-byte search unit;space-time tradeoff;text scanning","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

A major bottleneck that IPSs face is that they scan incoming packets one byte at a time, which limits their throughput and latency. In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later. We present algorithms that apply speculation in single-threaded software running on commodity processors as well as algorithms for parallel hardware.

This is due to the flawed assumption that an attacker does not have any information about an ADS. Advanced persistent threats that are capable of monitoring network behavior can always estimate some information about ADSs which makes these ADSs susceptible to evasion attacks. Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate the design methodology and extensive experimentation is performed to corroborate the results.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346858","","Detectors;Entropy;Estimation;Grippers;Intrusion detection;Parameter estimation","computer network security","anomaly detection system evasion;evade detection;intrusion detection system;key based randomization scheme;launch evasion attack;parameter estimation attacks","","","","24","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1;9781424429271","978-1-4244-2928-8;9781424429288","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

Our proposed algorithm performs independently partial pattern matching to extract the pattern from incoming multiple packets at multi gigabit network. The IPM is implemented by FPGA, TCAM and SRAM. Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","2325-5552;23255552","0-7803-9569-7;0780395697","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","17","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growth of network bandwidth and the increase of virus signatures call for high speed and scalable pattern matching algorithms. Motivated by several observations of a real-life virus signature database from Clam-AV, a popular antivirus application, a fast pattern matching algorithm named MRSI is proposed in this paper. Compared to the current algorithm implemented in Clam-AV, MRSI achieved an 80%~100% faster virus scanning speed without excessive memory usages.","","978-0-7695-3106-9;9780769531069","978-0-7695-3106-9;9780769531069","10.1109/ICN.2008.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498173","Algorithms;Anti-Virus;Pattern Matching;Performance;Virus Signatures","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Data security;Electronic mail;Information security;Intrusion detection;National security;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer viruses;telecommunication security","Clam-AV antivirus;Internet communication security;MRSI;anti-virus applications;fast pattern matching algorithm;intranet security gateways;virus scanning;virus signatures","","7","7","14","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this process, matching of packet strings against signature patterns dominates the overall system performance. The MWM algorithm has been known as the fastest pattern matching algorithm when the patterns in a rule set rarely appear in packets. However, the matching time does not decrease if the length of the shortest pattern in a signature group is too short. In this paper, by extending the length of the shortest pattern, we minimize the pattern matching time of the algorithm which uses multi-byte unit. For example, when the length of the shortest pattern is less than 5, the proposed algorithm shows 38.87% enhancement in average.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","978-1-4244-2026-1;9781424420261","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509892","","Communication networks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Computer security;Filtering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;digital signatures;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","MWM algorithm;SHIFT table;high-speed packet filtering;network intrusion detection system;pattern string matching algorithm;signature-based NIDS","","2","2","12","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm uses software bitmap for each multi-pattern signature without hardware changes, which maximizes flexibility of content processor. From the analysis of Snort which is the widely used intrusion detection system, we observe spatial locality between distances of patterns in the multi-pattern signature. The algorithm makes use of this distance information for adaptive performance optimization.

Matching a variety of signatures challenges the selection of matching algorithms, as each approach has better performance than others for different signature characteristics. We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality. We also rank the factors to indicate their importance for the string matching performance.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453354","String matching;automaton;filtering;virus scanning.","","automata theory;computer viruses;cryptography;digital signatures;public domain software;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;automata tracking;backward hashing algorithm;characteristic signature;open source ClamAV;string matching;virus scanning","","1","","28","","2010-04-22","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So from security perspective, to identify the attack in its initial stage and to minimize the impact of attack, it is important to detect scanning activities in a network. We have mainly considered TCP flow because most of the Internet application uses it as a transport protocol. Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host. The proposed method provides a generic solution to SYN scan (half open), connect scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan and null scan. Results obtained from our method prove the detection capabilities and accuracy.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772645","","Cities and towns;Computer networks;Data flow computing;Data security;Internet;Level measurement;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Transport protocols;Viruses (medical)","Internet;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FIN scan;Internet;SYN scan;TCP flow data;TCP packet header;Xmas scan;behaviour analysis;connect scan;null scan;scan traffic detection;telecommunication security;traffic anomaly;transport protocols","","2","","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","15","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
