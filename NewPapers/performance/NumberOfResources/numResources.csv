Such advantages have made them very popular within feature selection as explained in this paper.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For a given level of security, each protocol incurs a linearly increasing overhead in either communication cost per node or memory per node. We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment. We show that, unlike existing key-establishment protocols, both the communication and memory overheads of PIKE protocols scale sub-linearly (O(√n)) with the number of nodes in the network yet achieving higher security against node compromise than other protocols.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497920","","Base stations;Batteries;Computer architecture;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Elliptic curve cryptography;Energy consumption;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization","cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PIKE;asymmetric key cryptography;network security;peer intermediaries for key establishment protocol;peer intermediary;resource-constrained platform;sensor network;symmetric-key distribution protocol","","76","3","20","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Computer security;Data security;Evolutionary computation;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;anomaly detection;evolutionary neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning techniques;program behavior;system-call audit data;system-call sequences","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","16","","25","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To complement both manual and automated analysis of network traffic, we applied information visualization techniques to appropriately and effectively bring the human into the analytic loop. This paper describes the implementation and lessons learned from the creation of a novel network traffic visualization system capable of both realtime and forensic data analysis. Combining the strength of link analysis using parallel coordinate plots with the time-sequence animation of scatter plots, we examine a 2D and 3D coordinated display that provides insight into both legitimate and malicious network activity.

As the available MAC and routing protocols applied to WMNs do not have enough scalability as throughput drops significantly as the number of nodes or hops increases. Existing security schemes may be effective for certain types of attacks, but they lack a comprehensive mechanism to prevent attacks from different protocol layers. Similar problems exist in other networking protocols. Thus, existing communication protocols, ranging from routing, MAC, and physical layers, need to be revisited and enhanced.

However, due to huge amounts of log files in large-scale IPTV system, it is not easy to perform deep analysis for various metrics on time. The volume of log data is expected to increase rapidly because of the explosive growth of users. For the efficient management of analysis jobs for diverse metrics under a large set of log data, in this paper, we propose MapReduce-based IPTV log analysis methods on the cloud computing platform, called Hadoop. We carried out experiments with a small testbed and a large one with Amazon service, and found that the MapReduce-based approach outperforms the DBMS by 13 times.

During node mobility, there are possibilities for the malicious node to become the cluster head or cluster member. This causes the cluster or the whole network to be controlled by the malicious nodes. To offer high level of security, the mobile sensor nodes need to be authenticated. Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes. In addition, a bidirectional malicious node detection technique is employed which eliminates the malicious node from the network. By simulation, it is proved that the proposed technique provides efficient security with reduced energy consumption during node mobility.","1673-5447;16735447","","","10.1109/CC.2016.7513213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513213","cluster;dynamic key;heterogeneous;mobility;weight;wireless sensor network","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Heuristic algorithms;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","authenticated nodes;average distance;average speed;bidirectional malicious node detection technique;cluster based secure dynamic keying technique;cluster head;cluster member;data delivery;energy efficient routing;heterogeneous mobile wireless sensor networks;node degree;node mobility;sensor nodes;virtual battery power;weight value","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks.

Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9;0769525539","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks.

The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","47","","2015-03-27","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, we assume a large number of nodes with multihop routes using the shortest path routing, so that the routes can be modelled as straight line segments. Furthermore, we assume that we are able to measure the number of transmissions occurring in the different parts of the network during the measurement periods. In this setting we study the problem of inferring the end-to-end traffic demands (traffic matrix) based on the available information. As this information is not sufficient we make some additional Poissonian assumptions on the nature of the traffic in order to have a well-defined problem with a unique solution. Analysing the problem in the framework of stochastic geometry, we are able to give an exact solution for the formulated traffic matrix estimation problem.

Actually, managing MANETspsila security is a hard challenge due to the inherent complexity and the tremendous number of parameters which should be considered. To provide efficient security management, we focus on three main parameters: the secured device capabilities, the associated network security and the secured applications. The solution we propose, named Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a scalable, flexible and application-oriented framework able to manage security depending on the application requirements and the network security conditions. ASMA is based on a structure called macrograph combining both dynamic trust management and multipath routing. The macrograph structure is capable to estimate transmission security in order to assure that communications are established only when they match applications security requirements. ASMA flexibility offers compliance with most on-demand routing protocols and security tools. In this paper we present simulation results for ASMA associated with AOMDV (a multipath declination of AODV) routing protocol and compare results with AOMDV. We show that ASMA-AOMDV outperforms AOMDV, dividing by three the packet loss rate in networks including 20% of malicious nodes, while causing only 3% of additional loss in safe networks.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575258","","Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;National security;Performance analysis;Resource management;Robustness;Routing protocols;Scalability","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","adaptive secured multipath for ad hoc networks;dynamic MANET;flexible security management solution;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;packet loss rate;routing protocols","","0","","11","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed malicious node detection protocol using authentication technique for ad hoc as well as internet networks. As the protocol depends on one-way hash operation and does not consider any high computation such as exponentiation or pairing computation, so it achieves high performance. Besides, the number of message passes is also reduced to authenticate a node within the network. The proposed protocol is simulated using AVISPA software, and the simulation results make certain that the protocol is SAFE under OFMC and CL-AtSe models.

Malicious nodes can attack the network by jamming, selectively forwarding packets, black-hole attack and spoofing. In the case of statically deployed, dense Wireless Sensor Networks which use flat routing, alternate path for secure transmission on packets across such malicious nodes have to be found. Scattering multiple copies of the packets in order to reach the sink, leads to more network and energy inefficiency. Moreover, collusion of malicious nodes is addressed vaguely by literature. In this paper, we propose a secure routing methodology which semi-randomly propagates a packet in the shortest path to the Sink by circumventing the malicious nodes. Extensive simulations show that the number of broadcast hops, activity of network and the packet drop ratio are significantly lesser for the proposed routing technique.

Many clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them implicitly assume that nodes behave honestly in the clustering process. In practice, there might be some malicious nodes trying to manipulate the clustering process to make them serve as clusterheads, which can obtain some special power, e.g., eavesdropping more messages. In this paper we present a secure weighted clustering algorithm (SWCA). SWCA uses the weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) for clustering and TELSA for efficiently authenticating packets. We propose a novel neighbor verification scheme to check whether the values of election-related features (e.g., node degree) are forged by malicious nodes. Also, we theoretically analyze the probability for a malicious node to tamper node degree without being detected and derive a lower bound on the probability. Finally, simulation results show that SWCA is secure but still has comparable performance with WCA. To the best of our knowledge, SWCA is the first algorithm considering the security of 1-hop type clustering (in this type only the clusterhead can communicate with ordinary members directly) in ad hoc networks.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-2947-9;9781424429479","978-1-4244-2948-6;9781424429486","10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4917979","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Clustering algorithms;Communications Society;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Security;Software algorithms","ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","QoS;ad hoc networks;broadcasting;malicious node probability;packet authentication;routing;secure weighted clustering algorithm;wireless ad hoc networks","","1","","26","","","5-8 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7;9781467355247","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used.

However, those efforts concentrated on preventive techniques constituting a first line of defense (like cryptography and authentication), which are effective in inhibiting the diverse malicious attacks. Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one.

It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients.

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6;9781424498796","978-0-7695-4330-7;9780769543307","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","2","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2503399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360925","Bayesian network;cybersecurity;incident prediction;industrial control system (ICS);multiple models;risk assessment","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Industrial control;Risk management","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In such a system, once some nodes have been compromised, the attack would be directed by the network topology because compromise of a node may cause the compromise of its neighbors. Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion detection alarm of the networked system. In such a setting, a question of particular interest to the system administrator is: What is the quantitative security assurance of the networked system?

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-2161-4;0769521614","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","2379-5352;23795352","978-0-7695-4879-1;9780769548791","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies.

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes may lose power, crash, or simply move out of range of other nodes in the network. Identifying the root cause is complicated by a lack of fixed monitoring and analysis infrastructure. Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster. This effect is more pronounced in sparse networks.","2165-9605;21659605","978-1-4577-1588-4;9781457715884","978-3-901882-44-9;9783901882449","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104019","MANET;cross-layer;data dissemination;failure detection;network efficiency","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Detectors;Heart beat;Mobile computing;Protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","MANET;cross-layer cluster-based data dissemination;failure detection;k-hop cluster;neighbour-hood observation;node disconnection;node failure;routing message;spanning tree;sparse network","","0","","16","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","5","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This type of computation falls under the category of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). The solution to SMC problems in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) can be found with the modification of the data inputs or with some anonymization technique. MANETs are the wireless networks of the mobile computing devices with no support of any fixed infrastructure. The mobile nodes use any of the radio technology like Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 or Hiperlan for directly communicating with each other. The nodes behave as hosts as well as routers. The security challenges in the MANET arise due to its dynamic topology, vulnerable wireless link and nomadic environment. An identification mechanism is needed between the nodes using identification and the credentials. This security architecture simultaneously leads to privacy problems. Some mechanism is needed which prevents a node to learn the identity or the credentials of other nodes. To provide location privacy in MANET is a nontrivial task. Current routing protocols do not focus much on the security and the privacy issues. These aspects are postponed till further development. An authentication protocol is needed between nodes using some cryptographic technique. In service-oriented MANET the denial of the service must be taken care of so that the availability of the service is maintained. The security requirement of the ad hoc network depends on its application. For example, for a simple business meeting the requirement is mitigated and for the military battlefield it is severe. Thus no general security architecture can be developed for MANET. Specific security architecture is needed for specific application. Much security related work is still pending and will add to the standards as the physical deployment of the MANET will grow. In this paper, an empha- - sis is made on how SMC solutions can be used for privacy preservation during computation.","1811-3923;18113923","978-1-4244-7203-1;9781424472031","","10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587317","MANET;Privacy;Secure Multiparty Computation;Security","Ad hoc networks;Aggregates;Computational modeling;Irrigation;Mobile computing;Presses;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols","MANET;SMC;authentication protocol;cryptographic technique;distributed computing device;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing devices;privacy preservation;secure multiparty computation;security architecture;wireless network","","5","","16","","","6-8 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV.

Selfish nodes send and receive their own data but fail to forward other node's data, which reduces the throughput of the network.

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes.

Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

Since MANET is infrastructure-less and has no clear line of defense, it is accessible to both legitimate network users and malicious attackers. Hence, to prevent the network from various attacks, scheming of a robust security design is mandatory. Various approaches have been proposed with different cryptographic solutions to countermeasure the attacks against MANET but most of them have focused on specific security threats.

In this paper, we first propose rule organized optimal matching (ROOM),which splits the identification rules into several fields and elaborately organizes the matching order of the fields. Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set). Based on ROOM, wefurther propose MP-ROOM, which is extended to well support the rules cross multiple protocol data units (PDUs) fortraffic identification. In addition, we implement a prototype system including MP-ROOM and related work for evaluations.The evaluations show very promising results: 1.5 ~71.3 times throughput improvement is obtained by MP-ROOM inthe real system with less than 300-MB memory consumption.

We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security.

To go into detail of the online systems, we have carefully analyzed some well-known, state-of-the-art steganalysis algorithms and estimated their processing power and memory requirements. Some formulas are derived to relate the network bit rate with the number of the processing units, their processing power, and memory size.

Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this routing protocal, it records the signal energy and time duration when receiving a HELLO message firstly. And then according to signal energy loss formula in two ray ground model, the relative distance between nodes will be calculated. After that the node location will be estimated when it sends next HELLO messages by geometric methods. And then according to the estimated results the node chooses the more stable and reliable routing based on the calculated routing.

Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL.

With this trend, the importance of big-data security analytics has taken greater attention since identifying such latest attacks requires large-scale data processing and analysis. In this paper, we present SEAS-MR (Security Event Aggregation System over MapReduce) that facilitates scalable security event aggregation for comprehensive situation analysis. The introduced system provides the following three core functions: (i) periodic aggregation, (ii) on-demand aggregation, and (iii) query support for effective analysis.

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-2676-8;9781424426768","978-1-4244-2677-5;9781424426775","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment.

How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage.

Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node. Periodically monitor node is identified in the network.","","978-0-7695-3126-7;9780769531267","","10.1109/ISA.2008.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511525",": IDS;CDMA;DoS;QoS;TDMA;mIDS","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Availability;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Protection;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;cryptography;mobile computing;packet radio networks;telecommunication security","authentication;encryption software;firewalls;mobile computing environment;mobile intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;packet transmissions;response systems;security services;wireless networks","","3","","21","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol is effective even in presence of large fraction of malicious nodes in the network.

When WSNs are deployed in inaccessible areas, the probability of occurring different types of attacks is very high. So the security of WSN becomes extremely important. As sensors have limited processing power, limited storage, low bandwidth, and energy; traditional security measures designed for the resource-rich networks such as LAN etc. are not suitable for the resource-constrained WSN. In presence of such limitations it becomes mandatory to devise lightweight security solutions for data transmission in WSNs. Because of problems in public key cryptography such as costly key computation, longer keys, key vulnerability to brute force attack, key distribution and maintenance, etc., it is not preferred for WSN. The less computation and low memory requirements of symmetric key cryptography with very short length of key (lightweight) justifies its use in WSN to achieve information security. Hence, this paper aims to study, discuss and analyze the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms Suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks.","","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507438","Authenticity;Availability;Confidentiality;Data Freshness;Integrity;Lightweight Cryptography","Communication system security;Cryptography;Monitoring;Schedules;Vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","data transmission;environmental conditions;lightweight cryptographic algorithms;lightweight cryptography;public key cryptography;resource constrained WSN;resource rich networks;small sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there could be a issue of keys length, hence we can enforce the number of hops to be added for key generation after reaching threshold, then generation of keys starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the ongoing/flowing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a destination node, the source node will send a packet to a destination via a designated path. The target node and threshold node would be storing a expected key from all its neighbours, when a packet reaches to a target node or threshold node, key of packet and key of target node is compared, if a match is found, then accept the packet as valid one else discard it or deny the communication.

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme.

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features.

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","0-7803-8533-0;0780385330","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","10","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

This paper first reviews necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic detection of integrity attacks carried out by any number of malicious agents, based on the concept of left invertibility of structural control systems. It then develops a notion equivalent to structural left invertibility in terms of vertex separators of a graph, which allows a designer to efficiently determine if a network is perfectly attackable.

E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis.

The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes.

A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","4","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6;9780769533476","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","4","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not guaranteed that the bandwidth necessary to transmit all aggregated alerts is always available, which usually result in the transmission of a portion of the alerts, while others are discarded or queued. The transmission of insufficient alert information hinders making correct decisions about attacks, leading to compromising network security. In order to maximize the benefits of data aggregation while minimizing the impact of partial alerts, this paper presents a risk-driven real-time transmission prioritization technique for implementing lossy and lossless aggregation of cyber alerts. Lossy alert aggregation and transmission are managed adaptively by allowing the prioritization and transmission of aggregated alerts according to the risk assessment of such alerts. This paper also presents a risk-driven utilization model that further adapts the aggregation and prioritization in response to dynamic network conditions. The performance results of the proposed techniques are obtained by running simulations on data collected from a mobile network. Simulation results for the aggregation of raw alerts have shown an average reduction of 51% in data storage space and bandwidth usage.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785305","Alert Aggregation;Cyber Security;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Networks;Transmission Prioritization","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Propagation losses","mobile computing;security of data","alert aggregation;alert generation;alert information;cyber alerts;data aggregation;lossless aggregation;lossy aggregation;lossy alert aggregation;mobile networks;partial alerts;real-time transmission prioritization technique;risk driven aggregation prioritization;risk driven utilization model;security data","","0","","11","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","1738-9445;17389445","978-89-968650-2-5;9788996865025","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

The lack of infrastructuresupport and resource constraint is the key issue that causesdishonest and non-co-operative nodes. Therefore, MANET isvulnerable to serious attacks. To reduce the hazards from suchnodes and enhance the security of the network, this paperextends an Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector(AOMDV) Routing protocol, named as Trust-based Secured Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (TS-AOMDV), whichis based on the nodes' routing behavior. The proposed TSAOMDVaims at identifying and isolating the attacks such asflooding, black hole, and gray hole attacks in MANET. With thehelp of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and trust-based routing, attack identification and isolation are carried out in two phases ofrouting such as route discovery and data forwarding phase. IDSfacilitates complete routing security by observing both controlpackets and data packets that are involved in the routeidentification and the data forwarding phases. To improve therouting performance, the IDS integrates the measured statisticsinto the AOMDV routing protocol for the detection of attackers. This facilitates the TS-AOMDV to provide better routingperformance and security in MANET. Finally, the Trust basedSecured AOMDV, TS-AOMDV is compared with the existingAOMDV through the NS2 based simulation model. Theperformance evaluation reveals that the proposed TS-AOMDVimproves the performance in terms of throughput by 57.1%more than that of an AOMDV under adversary scenario.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","15","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the manager becomes a bottleneck for being connected by each client. It can even overload when too many clients request service simultaneously. The whole system may collapse when the central manager is attacked. And these systems are passive to detect and deal with the secure problem. We present a mobile agent-based P2P model for autonomous security hole discovery (MASHD). It can detect infection and network intrusion based on knowledge of the local host. Viruses are removed and connections are refused after identification. In case of a suspicious activity, MASHD initiates a voting approach to make a collective decision and take further action. The integration of peer-to-peer behavior with mobile agents reduces latency and load; however, flexibility, effectivity, security and cooperation of the system are enhanced.","","0-7695-2432-X;076952432X","","10.1109/CIT.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562741","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer viruses;Engineering management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Voting","authorisation;computer viruses;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","autonomous security hole discovery;computer viruses;mobile agent;network intrusion;peer-to-peer computing;security system","","1","","7","","","21-23 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations.

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","22","","33","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","1","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our methodology consists of 3 steps. The first step is to model adversary behavior of capture attackers and inside attackers which can dynamically and adaptively trigger the best attack strategies while avoiding detection and eviction. The second step is to model defense behavior of defenders utilizing intrusion detection and tolerance strategies to reactively and proactively counter dynamic adversary behavior. We leverage game theory to model attack/defense dynamics with the players being the attackers/defenders, the actions being the attack/defense strategies identified, and the payoff for each outcome being related to system survivability. The 3rd and final step is to identify and apply proper solution techniques that can effectively and efficiently analyze attack/defense dynamics as modeled by game theory for guiding the creation of effective defense strategies for assuring high survivability in military MANETs. The end product is a tool that is capable of analyzing a myriad of attacker behaviors and seeing the effectiveness of countering adaptive defense strategies which incorporate attack/defense dynamics.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357514","adversary modeling;defense behavior modeling;mobile ad hoc networks;reliability;survivability","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics","game theory;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","capture attackers;game theory;inside attackers;intrusion detection;military MANET applications;military mobile ad hoc networks","","","","36","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6;9780769540566","978-1-4244-7143-0;9781424471430","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087201","CUDA;GPGPU;Hadoop;NIDS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Ecosystems;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming;security of data","CUDA;Compute Unified Device Architecture;Flume;GPGPU;HBase;Hadoop framework;Hive;NIDS;NVidia;PF-ICF;Pig;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion pattern analytics;log files;network intrusion detection system;network security policy;network traffic;parallel programming model;pattern frequency inverse cluster frequency;score-weight approach;streaming data handling","","0","","15","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance.

In this work we propose a novel distributed node self-monitoring mechanism for wireless sensor networks. Assuming a sensor node can detect the communications (sending message) of its neighboring nodes, we design a one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, in which the selected nodes, named Monitor Nodes (MNs), can monitor their neighboring nodes. A distributed dominating set approximation algorithm is design to obtain the MN set. The cooperation among MNs guarantees all regular nodes (RNs) are monitored. However, the MNs may be compromised by external attackers and produces false alarms. To improve the one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, we design a many-to-one dynamical monitoring approach to take the MNs under surveillance. The neighboring nodes of a MN are dynamically selected to monitor their MN. In the proposed mechanism, a node produces an alert when it detects abnormal behaviors of the node under surveillance. The sink node collects the alert messages to make judgment to the potential abnormal nodes. The proposed self-monitoring mechanism can be used to detect and position multiple inter-network attacks, including selective forwarding, black-hole and DoS.

While the recent push for a “Smart Grid” has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation.

Actually, their salient features, essentially the absence of infrastructure and auto-management, promise huge applications and possibilities for wireless communication. However, the tremendous boom of these networks depends incontestably on their reliability in terms of security and quality of services (QoS). In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities. Hence, our proposed IDS represents an urgent and primary line of defense since it protects from the protocol flaws themselves avoiding a significant panoply of easily operated attacks.","1525-3511;15253511","1-4244-0658-7;1424406587","1-4244-0659-5;1424406595","10.1109/WCNC.2007.487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224732","","Ad hoc networks;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Defense industry;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Protection;Quality of service;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;security of data","IDS services;OLSR protocol;ad hoc networks;quality of services;security services","","1","","12","","","11-15 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) may act as defensive mechanisms, since they monitor network activities in order to detect malicious actions performed by intruders, and then initiate the appropriate countermeasures. IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different existing IDS architectures for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANETs, this architecture is a combination model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA).

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","FVPATA;Fiedler nodes;Fiedler value;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;NS3;OLSR protocol;Puncture-Style Attacks;ad hoc network topology;collision avoidance;graph theory;health-care monitoring;optimized link state routing protocol;peer-to-peer communication;robotic agent;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network;vehicle accident;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS). We also discuss on how the similar friendship concept could be used to address several challenges faced in MANET environment.","","978-0-7695-3324-7;9780769533247","","10.1109/IAS.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627093","Friend Mechanisms;MANET;Small World","Ad hoc networks;Centralized control;Communication system control;Data communication;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Waste materials","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MANET;QoS;autoconfiguration methods;autonomous environment;battery power;data transmission process;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;resource degradation;resource management","","4","","15","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A perfect compensation of the drift caused by the fault on the objective function is shown to be achievable using time varying gains; the set of such time-varying gains is computed and it is shown that it satisfies a suitable autoregressive equation. Further, we estimate the convergence region of the state vector when the proposed compensation technique is used in the presence of persistent unknown but bounded disturbances.

To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow","2155-7578;21557578","1-4244-0617-X;142440617X","1-4244-0618-8;1424406188","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733","","Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology","Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security","IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities","","1","2","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use the multi-agent paradigm to model the proposed distributed system. In this system, an agent, which plays several roles, is situated on each node of the net. The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence. Experiments on our system show its potential for satisfactory DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4799-3019-7;9781479930197","","10.1109/INISTA.2014.6873596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873596","DDoS;IDS;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Network security","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Wide area networks","Internet;computer network security;multi-agent systems;wide area networks","IDS;Internet;agent neighbouring;collective intrusion detection;data sharing;distributed denial of service;distributed system;local neighbour nodes;multiagent paradigm;satisfactory DDoS attack detection;security data;security event;wide area networks","","0","","15","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","1530-0889;15300889","978-1-4244-4422-9;9781424444229","978-1-4244-4421-2;9781424444212","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","28","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented.

Security requirements in MANET have to be much efficient due to specific characteristics of ad hoc network. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an integral part of any mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It is very important for IDS to function properly for the efficient functioning of a MANET. In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer. We simulate a couple of intrusions in each of the two layers and look to resolve them using the coalition formation of the mobile nodes. These nodes obey the shapely value phenomena of the game theory concept and form coalitions to report intrusions in the network.","","978-1-4244-2962-2;9781424429622","978-1-4244-2963-9;9781424429639","10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760460","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;cluster based cooperative game theory;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile ad-hoc grid","","0","","7","","","14-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055;10952055","1-4244-0572-6;1424405726","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster.

Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends. Finally, we propose a set of visual metaphor extensions that augment the proposed paradigm and enhance users' situational awareness.

Instead, the mobile nodes forward packets to each others, allowing communication among nodes outside wireless transmission range. In this dynamic network, each node is considered as a mobile router but in an energy-conserving manner. This fact makes node an active element in the network which is able of the best and of the worst. Actually, a malicious node can easily disrupt the proper functioning of the routing by simply refusing to forward routing message (misbehavior node), inject the wrong routing packets, modifying others, etc. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc network based on multi-agent systems and particularly on ant behavior. The novelty of our protocol relies in the fact that, apparently for the first time, a protocol combines at the same time routing on one side and trust level and reputation between nodes on the other side. This combination permits to increase the security of route establishment. More generally, this protocol opens the door to the use of different agents for obtaining different mixed functionalities, routing and trust level in this paper but also other functionalities like key-distribution.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529460","","Ad hoc networks;Ant colony optimization;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Femtocell networks;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Multiagent systems;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multi-agent systems;routing protocols;security of data","AntTrust;ant behavior;ant routing protocol;mobile nodes;mobile router;multi agent systems;trust;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","20","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This ensures that, there is a packet integrity. This technique can trigger a issue of keys length, therefore we can enforce the number of hops to be added for the key generation, after reaching a threshold limit, then keys generation starts from the beginning. Here all nodes in the network would generate a X-key and appends to the flowing/ongoing key. When a source node initiates communication towards a target node, the source node will send a packet to a target via a recognised path. The destination node and threshold node would be holding a expected key which is delivered from the alternative path, when a packet reaches to a destination/threshold node, the packet's key and key of target/threshold node is compared, if both keys are matched then accept the packet as genuine one else discard it or deny the communication. This MANET enforces two level of security validation, first one is, key checking at each threshold node, another is, ensuring key integrity via true node's path to validate the packet.","","978-1-4799-6437-6;9781479964376","","10.1109/ICACCS.2015.7324085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324085","AODV;Alternative path;DSR;Flowing-key;MANET;Random-Key;Threshold;X-Key","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Mobile computing;Routing;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;X-key;destination node;flowing-ongoing key;mobile ad hoc network;mobile devices;packet integrity;random keys;robust security;source node;target node;threshold based path oriented network;threshold node","","","","12","","","5-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously ""unseen"" attacks.

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally.

Centralised approaches benefit from simplicity of implementation and high algorithm expressiveness, but suffer in terms of scalability. The scalability issue is alleviated with hierarchical and decentralised approaches, but this comes at a cost of additional implementation complexity and lower algorithm quality. Introduced is a new alert correlation architecture based on Hadoop. The developed architecture allows for greater scalability whilst maintaining algorithm expressiveness and design simplicity. It incorporates alert aggregation, verification, and correlation components, which together provide for a clear and succinct view of potentially malicious activity. Each component was tested against a series of datasets that represent potential real world scenarios across a cluster of varying size. The results demonstrate that all components in the architecture have the ability to scale across many nodes in a cluster, allowing for the processing of large and complex attack scenarios in a timely manner.","","978-1-4799-8690-3;9781479986903","","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389673","Hadoop;aggregation;correlation;verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Scalability","data handling;formal verification;parallel processing;security of data;software architecture","Hadoop;IDS;alert aggregation;alert correlation architecture;alert verification;attack scenario;intrusion detection system","","","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Maintaining throughput network connectivity in ad hoc networks","Y. Liu; A. Garnaev; W.

To cope with such interference, the paper introduces throughput connectivity and weighted throughput connectivity. Throughput connectivity reflects the possibility of establishing communication between nodes for given a signal power level, while weighted throughput connectivity associates the throughput as a weight in the associated network graph. Throughput connectivity is less sensitive to network's parameters than the one based on weighted throughput connectivity. It makes maintaining throughput connectivity protocol less resource consuming (say, by sending less frequently channel state information (CSI)). Whereas, weighted throughput protocol is more efficient in power allocation due to employing a continuous scale in Laplacian matrix. To illustrate these notions, two approaches to maximize connectivity were considered: (a) an adaptive transmission protocol that re-allocates transmission power between nodes, and (b) detecting and eliminating a malicious threat to maintain accumulated connectivity over time slots. The first problem was modeled by a maxmin problem, and solved by Semi-Definite Programming. The second problem was modeled by a stochastic game and solved explicitly.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7472905","Connectivity;Fiedler value;Jamming;Stochastic game;Throughput Connectivity","Adaptation models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Games;Interference;Laplace equations;Protocols;Throughput","ad hoc networks;game theory;mathematical programming;minimax techniques","Laplacian matrix;ad hoc networks;adaptive transmission protocol;maxmin problem;power allocation;semi-definite programming;stochastic game;throughput network connectivity protocol;weighted throughput protocol","","","","30","","","20-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data.

In particular, the set packing algorithm is used to optimize the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a trust node aware optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing in the communications of the nodes.

This is the basis of designing widely used routing protocols (example AODV). However, a node with malicious intentions can launch an attack on the network and disrupt its operations. Hence there is an utmost necessity of a mechanism to identify the attack and protect the system from the attackers. In this paper we present a method on providing security in MANET during route maintenance phase using Attacker Detection System (ADS) with the help of Honeypot (HP) and Attack History Database (AHD). The HP interacts with the attackers in order to know their motives and respond accordingly. The use of AHD helps HP in quick attack/attacker identification and crafting replies to attacker. We have simulated MANET with ADS and implemented it in sizes varying from 20 to 200 nodes in NS2. The results presented in paper conform to our claim on the efficiency of ADS in protecting MANET. Also the edge achieved in handling the attacker with the use of HoneyPots and Attack History Database is seen in results.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359424","Attack History database;HoneyPots;MANET;Route maintenance;Security","Databases;History;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV route maintenance;HoneyPots;MANET;attack history database;attack-attacker identification;attacker detection system;centralized network management;route establishment","","","","30","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","8","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increased uncertainty and complexity will increase the costs of malicious probing and attack efforts and thus prevent or limit network intrusion. As MTD increases complexity of the system for the attacker, the MTD also increases complexity in the desired operation of the system. This introduced complexity results in more difficult network troubleshooting and can cause network degradation or longer network outages. In this research paper the authors describe the defensive work factor concept. Defensive work factors considers in detail the specific impact that the MTD approach has on computing resources and network resources. Measuring impacts on system performance along with identifying how network services (e.g., DHCP, DNS, in-place security mechanisms) are affected by the MTD approach are presented. Also included is a case study of an MTD deployment and the defensive work factor costs.

Experimental results show that such optimization gives a smaller number of rules, while the accuracy increases in comparison to existing approaches. In particular, it showed an accuracy of 98% when using only 39 rules. In our research we contribute to forensics science by increasing awareness and bringing more comprehensive fuzzy rules.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: full information and partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem. We perform extensive simulations to validate the analysis and demonstrate the impact of system factors on the overall cost.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2560518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462258","crowdsourcing;largescale networks.;malicious users detection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Incentive schemes;Internet of things;Optimization;Sensors;Social network services","","","","","","","","2016-04-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, insufficiency of memory and battery power of sensors makes sensor networks vulnerable to be attacked. As a second line of defense, intrusion detection system (IDS) is one useful method defending against attacks. In present literatures, most of IDS models in WSN are static IDS (SIDS), which have inherent disadvantages and are not feasible for WSN. This paper proposes a dynamic model of IDS (DIDS) for WSN, which has a remarkable improvement in the security, stability and robustness issues as compared to SIDS.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","7","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789;08407789","978-1-4244-5376-4;9781424453764","978-1-4244-5377-1;9781424453771","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we consider the signature detection technique and investigate the ability of various routing protocols to facilitate intrusion detection when the attack signatures are completely known. We show that reactive ad-hoc routing protocols suffer from a serious problem due to which it might be difficult to detect intrusions even in the absence of mobility.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195","Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses","Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing","Internet;public key cryptography","DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism","","0","","41","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

Based on the empirical results, a node model is proposed that captures the behavior of anomalies at individual network nodes. The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented.

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.","1092-1648;10921648","","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733610","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Middleboxes;Radiation detectors;Round robin;Schedules;Time complexity","computational complexity;queueing theory;scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","WAN optimization;application level firewall;dominant resource fairness;elastic round robin;intrusion detection system;low complexity packet scheduler;multiple middlebox resources;multiresource fair queueing scheme;multiresource round robin;packet processing;time complexity;traffic flow","","5","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059537","Bayes rule;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE);secure routing;strategy","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Mobile computing;Receivers;Routing protocols","Bayes methods;cryptographic protocols;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANETs;PBE strategy;anonymous behaviors;belief updating systems;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;game theory model;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;regular nodes;reputation system;secure routing protocol;security attacks","","0","","","","","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4799-8466-4;9781479984664","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CISIM '08. 7th","20080709","2008","","","121","126","In this paper, a new honest-rate base collaborative intrusion detection system (HIDS) has been proposed for mobile, ad-hoc networks. The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection. The h-rate may also be used for secure routing in MANET.","","978-0-7695-3184-7;9780769531847","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557846","IDS;MANET;attacks;collaborative decision making;neighborhood watch;private key","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data","MANET;collaborative decision making;collaborative intrusion detection system;honesty-rate;mobile ad-hoc networks;multiple threshold values;packet forwarding;phantom intrusion detection;rule-based scheme","","4","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","38","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a new architecture for IPPT (IP Packet Tracing) based on the traditional concept of keeping traffic logs stored in Bloom filters. The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed. The communication among the system's components preserves the confidentiality of the packet's information. The architecture was implemented and experimental results are presented.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-1042-2;9781424410422","978-1-4244-1043-9;9781424410439","10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4411261","","Computer architecture;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Paging strategies;Protection;Protocols;Software safety;Software tools;Web and internet services","Internet;protocols;tracking","Bloom filters;IP;Internet Protocol;attack graphs;dynamic log paging strategy;tracking;traffic logs","","0","","14","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many different type of worms in the wild, mostly categorized based on how they find and infect their new victims (i.e. active, passive, etc.). In this paper, we investigate a new approach for detecting passive worms and malware in P2P networks based on the popularity of files in the network.

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

However, the characteristics of these attacks are adaptable, compromising thus the efficiency of IDS mechanisms. Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Hidden Markov Model based on Viterbi algorithm to detect distributed denial of service attacks in data communication networks.

But the properties of constrained resources make WSNs vulnerable to different types of intrusions such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which result in a large number of compromised nodes. For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes. Finally, the system is analyzed and verified. The simulation results indicate that the compromised nodes can self-recover effectively and network total energy consumption also is reduced effectively.","","","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2013.6823943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823943","DoS attacks;Intrusion detection;Sef-recovery;Wireless sensor networks","Computer crime;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;software agents;wireless sensor networks","agent based intrusion detection;denial of service attacks;network total energy consumption;self-recovery system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods.

We focus on the problem of anonymizing IP addresses in a trace. More specifically, we are interested in prefix-preserving anonymization in which the prefix relationship among IP addresses is preserved in the anonymized trace, making such a trace usable in situations where prefix relationships are important. The goal of our work is two fold. First, we develop a cryptography-based, prefix-preserving anonymization technique that is provably as secure as the existing well-known TCPdpriv scheme, and unlike TCPdpriv, provides consistent prefix-preservation in large scale distributed setting. Second, we evaluate the security properties inherent in all prefix-preserving IP address anonymization schemes (including TCPdpriv). Through the analysis of Internet backbone traffic traces, we investigate the effect of some types of attacks on the security of any prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm. We also derive results for the optimum manner in which an attack should proceed, which provides a bound on the effectiveness of attacks in general.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-1856-7;0769518567","","10.1109/ICNP.2002.1181415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181415","","Binary trees;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Decision making;Stress","Internet;cryptography;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP addresses;Internet backbone traffic traces;Internet research;TCPdpriv scheme;confidential information;cryptography;measurement-based security evaluation;optimisation;prefix-preserving IP address anonymity;prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm;private information;real-world traffic traces;security attacks;security properties","","18","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms. Finally, we apply our findings to evaluate bot assessment strategies for forensic analysis after a worm tree has been formed.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218774","Botnet;detection;probabilistic modeling;simulation;topology;worm infection family tree","Analytical models;Grippers;Internet;Joints;Mathematical model;Measurement;Peer to peer computing","Internet;Poisson distribution;computer network security;geometry;invasive software;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","Internet worm infection family tree characteristics;Poisson distribution;approximate-logarithmic average path length;asymptotic geometric distribution;bot assessment strategies;botnets;children;forensic analysis;host infection ability quantification;localized-scanning worms;mathematical analysis;permutation-scanning worms;probabilistic modeling methods;security threats;sequential growth model;simulations;vulnerable host;worm infection topology","","1","","40","","2012-06-15","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4673-0714-7;9781467307147","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To identify defecting or compromised nodes including Byzantine behavior we propose a clustered intrusion detection architecture. Our architecture exploits multisensor data and supplementary information to identify defectors based on deviations from predicted values and correlated measurements and behavior. Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","1","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8;9781479998548","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

We then present a prototype system intended to aid in heart sound analysis. Based on a wavelet decomposition of the sounds, feature vectors are formed and ANNs finds use in classification of Heart valve diseases for its discriminative training ability and easy implementation. The heart sound diseases classes considered for the purpose of this study were classified into normal heart sound and the other six valve physiological heart categories. 4 type of ANN which used for this approach are Multilayer perceptron!(MLP), Back Propagation Algorithm (BPA), Elman Neural Network (ENN) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network. Using these ANN classifiers would appeared ability of classifying heart disease and will be shown an accuracy of 81.25 % for MLP, 87.17% for BPA, 91.59% for ENN and 96.42% for RBF was achieved.","","978-1-4244-7483-7;9781424474837","","10.1109/ICBME.2010.5704934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704934","Artificial Neural Network classifier;Back Propagation Algorithm;Elman Neural Network;Heart sound recognition;Heart valve diseases;RBF Neural Network;feature vector","Artificial neural networks;Generators;Medical diagnostic imaging","backpropagation;diseases;echocardiography;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;pattern recognition;physiology;radial basis function networks;signal classification","Elman neural network;artificial neural network;backpropagation algorithm;complex pattern recognition;discriminative training ability;heart sound analysis;heart sound recognition;multilayer perceptron;physiological heart categories;radial basis function network;signal classification;valve-physiological heart disease;wavelet decomposition","","1","","16","","","3-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enhance security, various trust-based schemes have been proposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However, most of them use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection, without taking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high false positives, low malicious node detection rate, and network partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) computation strategy, that adapts the trust threshold in the routing protocol according to network conditions such as rate of link changes, node degree and connectivity, and average neighborhood trustworthiness. We identify the topology factors that affect the trust threshold at each node, and leverage them to build a mathematical model for ATT computation. Our simulation results indicate that the ATT strategy achieves significant improvements in packet delivery ratio, reduction in false positives, and increase in detection rate as compared to traditional static threshold strategies.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345347","MANETs;Trust-based security;adaptive threshold;static threshold;threshold computation","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Measurement;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Security","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","ATT computation strategy;MANETs;adaptive trust threshold strategy;cryptography-based security schemes;distributed architecture;dynamic network topology;high false positive reduction;low malicious node detection rate;mathematical model;misbehaving node detection;misbehaving node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;network partitioning;packet delivery ratio;predefined trust thresholds;routing protocol;static threshold strategy;trust-based schemes","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Looking at performance metrics like detection / false alarm rates, a radio-based solution relying on the received signal strength (RSS) evaluation of a single radio channel is not sufficient. With a multi-channel approach and up to eight redundant RSS readings, the position estimation error can be reduced significantly. The paper focuses on the communication schedule to realize a real-time operation and the fusion of the redundant RSS readings, coming from IEEE 802.15.4 compliant 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz radio transceivers.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9;9781467362399","978-0-7695-4952-1;9780769549521","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Wireless networks are susceptible to many attacks like Black Hole Attacks, Gray Hole Attacks, Worm Hole Attacks, Sink Hole, Sleep Deprivation Torture, Sybil Attack etc. These Networks needs to be protected using firewalls, encryption software, network failure detection schemes for detecting the attacks and minimizing their effects. Many of these schemes designed so far are not absolute and require more supporting systems. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is important to identify the malicious nodes, isolate the problem created by such nodes and notify the information of the malicious node to the other nodes. The ultimate aim of these schemes is to provide the necessary security cover to the network by adding encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

Proceedings","20030225","2002","1","","395","399 vol.1","High-speed, switched networks present scalability challenges to a network intrusion detection system, both in terms of the volume of data that must be analyzed, and the extent to which sensors must be inserted into the switched network to achieve comprehensive visibility. An architecture that uses a single point for intrusion assessment would quickly become overwhelmed with incoming event data from intrusion sensors that are deployed on even a moderate number of high-speed links. This is particularly true if an earnest attack (generating many events in a short period of time) is underway. The authors propose a novel architecture that hierarchically distributes the assessment function into two assessment categories - tactical assessment, and strategic assessment. The tactical assessment function provides low-level event correlation and decision making for a small sub-network (e.g., a department LAN, an ATM switch peer group, etc.), and is capable of providing fast, real-time response when millisecond response times are required due to network attacks. The strategic assessment function, on the other hand, implements high-level event correlation, which is useful when a larger view of the network is required (e.g., for low intensity or distributed attacks). The tactical assessment engines interface to the strategic assessment engine by, filtering and summarizing low-level events, ensuring that the strategic assessment engine's workload remains manageable. This paper describes the distributed intrusion assessment architecture in more detail, presents a few application scenarios that benefit from hierarchical attack assessment, and summarizes ongoing work in developing prototype components for this architecture.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1180474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180474","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision making;Delay;Engines;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Sensor systems;Switches","asynchronous transfer mode;correlation methods;local area networks;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM switch peer group;decision making;department LAN;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion assessment architecture;event data;filtering;high-level event correlation;high-speed links;high-speed switched networks;intrusion mitigation;intrusion sensors;low intensity attacks;low-level event correlation;network architecture;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;real-time response;scaleable architecture;strategic assessment engine;sub-network;tactical assessment engines","","3","","6","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized ""trust no peer"" mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","0-7803-7952-7;0780379527","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Protecting peer-to-peer network with roaming agents","S. M. Banik; H. Urey","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina, USA","SoutheastCon 2015","20150625","2015","","","1","6","Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application.

This is very important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is known for limitations on hardware and software and for resources-constrained in general. An adaptive model of security that meets requirements and constraints in WSN is Intrusion Detections.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4244-4153-2;9781424441532","978-0-7695-3650-7;9780769536507","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","10","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a model for assessing cost of responses based on three factors, the cost of damage caused by the intrusion, the cost of automatic response to an intrusion and the operational cost. The proposed approach provides consistent basis for response assessment across different systems and environment.

These two concerns, however, are often handled separately. In this paper we present a threat driven approach that improves on the quality of software through the realization of a more secure functional model. The approach introduces systematic transformation rules and integration steps for mapping attack tree representations into lower level dynamic behavior, then integrates this behavior into state chart-based functional models. Through the focus on both the functional and threat behavior, software engineers can introduce, clearly define and understand security concerns as software is designed.

Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot.

In flat topology, the nodes relay every data item collected by each node towards the gateway node, thereby draining the energy of the relaying nodes soon. In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes.

All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes.

Flexible neural tree is hierarchical neural network like structure, which is automatically created and optimized using evolutionary like algorithms to solve the given problem.

"Multigrade security monitoring for ad-hoc wireless networks","M. T. Creti; M. Beaman; S. Bagchi; Zhiyuan Li; Yung-Hsiang Lu","","2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems","20091117","2009","","","342","352","Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modelbased thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observed thermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.","2168-7161;21687161","","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274707","Anomaly detection;green datacenters;heat imbalance;high-performance computing;virtualization","Cooling;Heating;Histograms;Servers;Temperature measurement;Thermal sensors","","","","","","","","2015-09-23","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed.

The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.","0018-9286;00189286","","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790","Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack","Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon","computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks","","2","","19","","2014-08-28","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9;9781479941919","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them.

Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445;17389445","978-1-4673-0150-3;9781467301503","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality.

With a centralized controller, the process of updating networks becomes much more convenient when compared to traditional networks. However, even with SDNs, transitional network states during network updates may still cause problems. Such states may result in a breakdown of isolation guarantees or other critical constraints and this could lead to incorrect behavior or even security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel abstraction for network updates, inter-flow consistency, that can account for relationships and constraints among different flows during updates. We present a generic inter-flow consistency constraint, version isolation, and a special case, spatial isolation. We propose update scheduling algorithms based on dependency graphs and a data structure that captures dependencies among different update operations & network elements. We also implemented a prototype system on a Mininet OpenFlow network and Ryu SDN controller to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is able to enforce inter-flow consistency constraints with reasonable overheads and that overheads for version isolation are higher than for spatial isolation. Furthermore, when only spatial isolation constraints are in use, overheads on update times for flows that have no isolation constraints are very small (around 1%).","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346859","","Bandwidth;Communication networks;Conferences;Packet loss;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security","centralised control;computer network security;data structures;graph theory;software defined networking;telecommunication control","Mininet OpenFlow network;Ryu SDN controller;SDN update abstraction;centralized controller;control planes;data planes;data structure;dependency graphs;inter-flow consistency;inter-flow constraints;network updates;security vulnerabilities;software defined networks;spatial isolation;transitional network;update scheduling algorithms;version isolation","","1","","21","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game.

Moreover, we provide a holistic classification of main evaluation metrics, which can be used to evaluate and compare such frameworks.

Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors.

However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","2158-9178;21589178","978-0-7695-3747-4;9780769537474","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a need to develop intrusion detection techniques to deal with different types of attacks in virtual domains. In this paper we consider the design choices for attack detection and propose intrusion detection architecture to deal with attacks in virtual domains.

Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands. This scheme successively conglomerates the security and the network rescue mechanism free from attacks and their impacts on the network.

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.","","978-1-4799-8827-3;9781479988273","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467","Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time","","0","","17","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections.

The proposed mechanism is based on identifying outlier measurements inside each cell, as well as corroboration among neighboring cells in a hierarchical structure to identify cells with significant number of malicious nodes. We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against attackers with varying degrees of sophistication.

Our scheme borrows from small worlds, utilizes the concept of contacts, and use traffic pattern matching (TPM) and traffic volume matching (TVM) techniques. We also propose multi-directional search, in-network processing and query suppression to reduce communication overhead in energy-constrained MANETs and increase traceback robustness against spoofing and collusion.

IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system","","0-7695-0951-7;0769509517","","10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905436","","Authorization;Computer industry;Computer network reliability;Explosives;Information security;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graph theory;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","GrIDS;Internet security;University of California;coordinated network attacks;graph based intrusion detection system;graphical techniques;large networks;network characteristics;network traffic analysis;subgraph isomorphism;system performance;valid network activity","","0","3","6","","","2001","31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network. This cryptographic is highly secure which uses a distinct classified digital key which can be generated dynamically using the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm. This technique can ensure that data is securely transmitted in a reliable manner.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

Analyzing the data collected from smart meters can expose habits and can be potentially used to predict consumers' behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the confidentiality of information in the AMI consisting of nodes with interdependent correlated security assets. On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI. Using our model, we derive the minimum defense resources required and the optimal strategy of the defender. Finally, we show how our framework can be applied in a real-world scenario via a case study.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2332095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840293","Advanced metering infrastructure;Nash equilibrium;non-cooperative game theory;privacy;security;smart meters","Encryption;Games;Nash equilibrium;Smart grids;Smart meters","game theory;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Nash equilibrium;advanced metering infrastructure;consumer behaviors;defender;encryption level;information confidentiality;interdependent correlated security assets;minimum defense resources;noncooperative game;outbound data;privacy concerns;rational attacker;security modes;smart meters;smart-grid AMI","","3","","17","","2014-06-19","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported. After investigated by the enterprise's Security Operations Center (SOC), the forensic report shows that there is specific enterprise targeted APT cases and not ever discovered for over 120 days.","2379-7703;23797703","978-1-4673-7277-0;9781467372770","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207270","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT);Command and Control (C&amp;C);mapreduce;networking logs","Command and control systems;Computers;Electronic mail;Internet;Itemsets;Malware;Servers","business data processing;computer crime;digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software","APT attack;C&C channel;C&C sessions;Ctracer;SOC;Security Operations Center;advanced persistent threat;enterprise log data;forensic report;hackers;malware;network signature;scalable framework;stealthy activities detection;stealthy command and control channel detection;targeted attacks;traffic data","","1","","25","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4244-2912-7;9781424429127","978-1-4244-2913-4;9781424429134","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869","","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks","particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security","attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network","","1","","35","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has initiated various security threats, especially in unattended environments. Low Energy Aware Cluster Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in WSN that consumes limited energy; thus increases the network lifetime. The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, experimental analysis of the impact of existing DoS attacks on the performance of LEACH protocol, including Flooding attack, Black hole attack and Gray Hole attack will be presented. Secondly, a new DoS attack on LEACH called Scheduling attack will be introduced. In order to check the reliable operation of LEACH routing protocol, all attacks mentioned above are implemented and their impacts on the performance of the LEACH in terms of different metrics including packet delivery ratio, network lifetime and energy consumption have been evaluated.","","","","10.1109/IACS.2015.7103191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103191","Black Hole attack;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray Hole attack;LEACH;NS2;Scheduling attack;WSN;cluster;energy;network lifetime;security","Base stations;Computer crime;Data models;Floods;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","LEACH protocol;WSN;black hole attack;denial of service attacks;energy consumption;flooding attack;gray hole attack;hierarchical routing protocols;low energy aware cluster hierarchy;network lifetime;packet delivery ratio;scheduling attack;security of data transfer;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack.

In the networks the worm may consist of some list of vulnerable in particular targeted network. While the targeted hosts occurs it start propagates rapidly using the list. This factor may lead to the transactions terminal and it cannot guarantee for safety. Most detecting methods don't detect the worms in effective manner. For this purpose my works implements with intrusion detection system based on multi mobile agent technologies. In this vulnerability detection and restoration system, which restoration mechanism adopts ant colony optimization can reduce the vulnerability. In this transaction takes place first, at that time if any vulnerable presents it denotes that the file presents with worms and it specifies the worm in which stage. The stages are stable, vulnerable presence, exploit and zombie. By using this we can easily identify the worms and it can be detected. Intrusion detection method performs a major task. First vulnerability scanning is an activity, second is selecting infection targets, and our system detects the vulnerable and restore the activities.

So it is important to investigate distributed monitoring mechanism appropriate for ad hoc networks.

However, organizations that provide this information do not wish to expose the internal workings of their networks to potential attack. Traffic trace anonymization attempts to mitigate this concern by hiding sensitive information while preserving most of the empirical value of the trace. Unfortunately, many attacks such as statistical fingerprinting, known-plaintext, and port evaluation can serve to identify communications within a trace which can lead an attacker to the real-world identities of anonymized devices. The inherent graph structure embedded in network traffic stands as a primary lever in achieving such de-anonymization. We propose Netshuffle, a method that distorts the graph structure in the anonymized trace such that an attacker cannot rely on the edges (communications) to identify a particular end-node (device). In essence, we shuffle the edges of the graph like a deck of cards so that even if an attacker can identify an edge, that edge does not necessarily connect to the intended target. Thus, inferences based on features of communications will either lead an attacker astray, or force the attacker to guess as to the identity of the targeted node from several indistinguishable candidates. Netshuffle provides a complimentary vector of protection to current anonymization techniques at limited cost in data utility.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5962451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962451","","Equations;IEEE Communications Society;IP networks;Image edge detection;Merging;Peer to peer computing;Topology","IP networks;computer network security","Netshuffle;anonymized devices;deanonymization;graph distortion;inherent graph structure;known-plaintext;network traffic;port evaluation;statistical fingerprinting;traffic trace anonymization","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

Foreseen applications include safety applications, traffic efficiency enhancements, and infotainment services. To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","3","","31","","2012-12-21","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The work presented here is a partial achievement of the internal project WINSOME (WIreless sensor Network-based Secure system fOr structural integrity Monitoring and AlErting) at our Centre DEWS, whose target is to develop a cross-layer secure framework for advanced monitoring and alerting applications.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4673-2479-3;9781467324793","","10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583643","secure platform;security;security components;wireless sensor network","Middleware;Monitoring;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","condition monitoring;data acquisition;embedded systems;middleware;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AlErting;Centre DEWS;WINSOME;WSN;autonomous entity;computational resources;critical infrastructures;cross-layer secure framework;data acquisition;hazardous environments;middleware platform;networked embedded systems;nonstandard environment;secure monitoring services;secure platform;standard security conditions;structural integrity monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","2","","20","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 2000 International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","263","272","Among various types of denial of service attacks, “dropping attack” is probably the most difficult one to handle. This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a “uncompromised” router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module. This paper has evaluated and compared their detection performance","","0-7695-0921-5;0769509215","","10.1109/ICNP.2000.896310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896310","","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Counting circuits;Degradation;Delay;Internet;Position measurement;Quality of service;Statistical analysis;Statistics","Internet;packet switching;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet environment;TCP performance;denial of service attacks;detection performance;dropping attack;hacker;malicious packet dropping;packet reorderings;position;router;session delay;severe damage;statistical analysis module","","7","","14","","","2000","14 Nov 2000-17 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET routing disrupts if participating node do not perform its intended function and start performing malicious activity. A specific attack called Wormmhole attack enables an attacker to record packets at one location in the network, tunnels them to another location, and retransmits them into the network. In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route. The destination node detects the wormhole if the hop difference between neighbours of the nodes exceeds the acceptable level. Our simulation results shows that the WHOP is quite excellent in detecting wormhole of large tunnel lengths.","","978-1-4577-0311-9;9781457703119","","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5893822","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Synchronization","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;synchronisation","MANET routing;WHOP;clock synchronisation;directional antenna;hound packet;malicious activity;routing protocol;wormhole attack detection protocol","","9","","15","","","25-27 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present in this context an intrusion detection technique, based on received signal strength variations, allowing a node to verify the authenticity of nodes which communicate with it, according to their localizations.

For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

One of the techniques that has been widely used for achieving such requirements is the employment of In-Memory Key-Value Storage (IMKVS) as caching mechanisms in order to improve overall user experience. Memcached and Redis are applications that use IMKVS approach. Commonly IMKVS clients use Consistent Hashing to decide where to store an object, which may cause network load imbalance. Furthermore, these clients work only at the application layer, so network conditions are not considered to distribute user's accesses. This paper proposes a new cache architecture with two phases load balancing to improve IMKVS performance, which has adopted a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture to manage the load balancing mechanism. The proposal was evaluated in the Mininet emulation environment and shows an improvement on load balancing giving best user experience.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405549","","Computers;Control systems;IP networks;Load management;Protocols;Servers","computer centres;file servers;resource allocation;social networking (online);software defined networking;virtualisation","Mininet emulation;NFV;SDN;data center;datacenter;in-memory key-value storages;network function virtualization;social networks;two-phase load balancing","","","","12","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each node has a finite interaction range, which will be behaves as a router to communicate the packets to another node. DOS (Denial-of-Service) attack, Flooding attack are some serious threats in MANET which causes data unsafety in MANET. The main problem in MANET is that, the routing tables which consists of each neighbour node information which maintained by the each node for the dynamic topology creation which is insecure. So to overcome this drawback, a optimized FMNK (Finger print Minutiae point non-invertible Key) algorithm is produced utilizing Biometric image models are introduced which can afford security and authentication. An optimized FMNK-SSL-AES-256(Finger print non invert able key Secure Socket Layer-Advance Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm is being introduced to encrypt the information applying a key to increase the security in MANET. Once the algorithm was developed the tables are protected with this proposed model and the message communication among nodes shown through NS2 tool.

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","1","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","978-1-4673-8314-1;9781467383141","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presence of malicious nodes in an ad hoc network deteriorates the network performance. A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect malicious nodes. This approach has been found beneficial for identifying malicious nodes in black hole attack, neighbour attack, sequence number attack and packet forwarding attack up to 700 nodes.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2009.0616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645737","","","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;black hole attack;cooperative wireless nodes;intrusion detection system enhancement;malicious node detection;minimal energy consumption;neighbour attack;packet forwarding attack;sequence number attack","","4","","","","","November 26 2010","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience.

Collaboration among IDSs allows users to benefit from the collective knowledge and information from their collaborators and achieve more accurate intrusion detection. However, most existing collaborative intrusion detection networks rely on the exchange of intrusion data which raises privacy concerns. To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation.

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application. In the case of a civil application for ocean monitoring, the proposed technique is used to identify the minimum number of nodes required and their positions for effective communication.","","978-1-4799-8299-8;9781479982998","","10.1109/UT.2015.7108229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108229","deployment strategy;genetic algorithm;modeling;simulation;underwater acoustic sensor network","Genetic algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Three-dimensional displays","genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;pH;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","HVA;UWSN;computational intelligence techniques;energy constraints;genetic algorithm;high-value asset;ocean monitoring;physical network layout;sensor nodes;transmission frequency;underwater acoustic sensor networks;underwater sensor network positioning;wireless operation","","1","","21","","","23-25 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism.

For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated.

By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system.

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks.

We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic.

Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior.

Therefore, defensive techniques such as intrusion detection will need to be deployed and used in this already complicated system.

In particular, we apply the set packing algorithm to optimize (minimize) the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a Dijkstra's based optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing between the communications of the nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach is promising in decreasing the overall cost while keeping the security of the smart grid system.","1932-5517;19325517","978-1-4673-2727-5;9781467327275","978-1-4673-2728-2;9781467327282","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345688","cyber security;multiple-layer system;optimal location;optimal routing;smart grid;trust node","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Smart grids;Wide area networks","optimisation;power engineering computing;power system economics;security of data;smart power grids;telecommunication network routing","Dijkstra-based optimal routing algorithm;communication routing optimization;defensive systems;least cost routing;location optimization;multiple layer architecture;nodes communications;normal function;set packing algorithm;smart grid network infrastructure;trust nodes","","1","","20","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20030225","2002","2","","1089","1094 vol.2","Inherent characteristics of any ad hoc network such as dynamic topology and limited physical security poses severe security challenges to the network. Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","1","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The EAACK intrusion detection system solves the limitations of receiver collision, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report in earlier system. EAACK makes use of DSR routing protocol for network of small scale. However, as the network size increases and due to dynamic environment, performance of DSR protocol affects.

We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application.

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path.

A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time.

The anonymous protocols hide the identity of the malicious node and enhance the possibility of Black Hole Attack. In order to provide anonymity without compromising the security, we have extended Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing Protocol(ALERT) to make it secure. The secure version is named as Secure Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing protocol (S-ALERT). S-ALERT uses Suspect Detection algorithm to choose the nodes in a route which provide unperceivable route. If there is existence of a Black Hole it actually sends a false RREP packet and advertises itself as the shortest route found. The proposed scheme avoid the black hole problem, and also prevent the network from further malicious behavior.

First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of the network.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2526601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401098","Wireless sensor network;channel-aware;packet dropping;reputation system;routing;selective forwarding attack;wireless sensor network","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Packet loss;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CRS-A;WSN;adaptive aware detection;adaptive detection threshold;attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme;channel aware detection;forwarding packets;information integrity;monitored packet loss;selective forwarding attacks;sensor nodes;time-varied channel condition;wireless channel;wireless sensor networks","","","","35","","2016-02-08","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this network, the sensors are associated with different groups, based on their functional types and after deployment they collaborate with one another in the same group for doing any assigned task for that particular group. We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN. Our analysis shows that, the proposed scheme could work well in conjunction with other security mechanisms for sensor networks and is very effective to resist any adversary's attempt to be included in a legitimate group in the network.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455133","Group;One Way Accumulator;Security;Sensor","Computer networks;Data security;Electronic mail;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Object detection;Open wireless architecture;Surveillance;Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we take a first step in designing connectivity maintenance protocols for more realistic communication models. We propose a distributed connectivity maintenance protocol that explicitly accounts for the probabilistic nature of communication links and achieves a given target communication quality between nodes. Our protocol is simple to implement, and we demonstrate its robustness against random node failures, inaccuracy of node locations, and imperfect time synchronization of nodes using extensive simulations.

Each node in the MANET runs a local IDS (LIDS) that cooperates with others LIDS. A mobile agent framework is used to preserve the autonomy of each LIDS while providing a flexible technique for exploring the natural redundancies in MANET to compensate for the dynamic state of wireless links between high mobility nodes.

For instance, MANET is riddled by issues like unreliability of wireless media, uncertain connectivity, host mobility and lack of infrastructure. However, perhaps, a most important aspect of such networks is the problem of security. The computational load and complexity involved in this environment are strongly subject to the dynamic nature of network topology, especially the restriction by the node's available resources. Therefore, key management and authentication are a central aspect for security in MANET and thus they should not be weak. For such small-scale networks, we propose here a security architecture utilizing a seniority-based trust model and PGP type certification service by building a specific PKI. Related algorithms are also presented. The performance of this new model is evaluated through simulation.

However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure.

In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

In the detection protocol, different nodes play different roles, and use different monitor schemes. Virtual cluster head and monitor nodes are elected. Monitor nodes monitor cluster head, and report to virtual cluster head. Virtual cluster head broadcasts abnormal cluster head to all member nodes, and initiates a new cluster head election. Member nodes are monitored by their cluster head. Simulation shows that, the detection protocol can real-time predict traffic attacks, and consume less energy.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas.

WSN is used in outdoor applications like environmental monitoring and military surveillance. These open environments cause WSN to be more vulnerable to various wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming and broadcast attack. Securing a WSN from these attacks is a challenging task. Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the major security attacks in WSN. Jamming a single or cluster of nodes is a type of DoS attack on WSN. In this paper, a novel approach in detecting the physical layer DoS style jamming attack is proposed and analyzed. Here, we propose a method called physical layer jamming identification. This method is based on residual energy where few nodes are marked as monitor nodes. These nodes monitor the jamming attack by checking the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator and packet delivery ratio values of other nodes. It improves system performance and increases packet deliver ratio.","","978-1-4673-2922-4;9781467329224","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449882","Denial of service attack;Jamming attack;Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;Jamming;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;jamming;radio receivers;wireless sensor networks","DoS style jamming attack detection;WSN;broadcast attack;catalyst;computer networks;denial of service attack;environmental monitoring;military surveillance;open environments;outdoor applications;packet delivery ratio values;physical layer jamming identification;receiver signal strength indicator;residual energy;wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming;wireless sensor network","","1","","16","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199233","","Autonomous agents;Communications Society;Cost function;Event detection;Humans;Impedance;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Optimization methods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","ADRS sensor;MANET;accidental system errors;anomalous events;autonomous agent;cost-sensitive anomaly detection;decision-theoretical framework;detection accuracy;detection cost;detection performance;false positive rate;intentional attacks;key evaluation metrics;mobile ad hoc networks;operational cost;policy gradient algorithms;response cost;response system","","0","","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks as they are frequently deployed in open and unattended environments. In this paper, we describe the wormhole attack, a severe routing attack against sensor networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. We detail its characteristics and study its effects on the successful operation of a sensor network. We present state-of-the-art research for addressing wormhole related problems in wireless sensor networks and discuss the relative strengths and shortcomings of the proposed solutions. To date, most of the proposed defenses focus on preventive mechanisms that can be applied to protect sensor networks from this kind of attacks. However, no work has been published regarding the possibility of using more sophisticated methods, like intrusion detection systems, to achieve a more complete and autonomic defense mechanism against wormhole attackers. We present our work on intrusion detection and introduce a lightweight IDS framework, called LIDeA, designed for wireless sensor networks. LIDeA is based on a distributed architecture, in which nodes overhear their neighboring nodes and collaborate with each other in order to successfully detect an intrusion.

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","6","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is usually no exchange of information between an IDS in one organization with those in other organizations. The effectiveness of IDSs at detecting present-day sophisticated attacks would increase significantly if there are inter-organizational communication and sharing of information among IDSs. We envision a global Internet-scale defense infrastructure, which we call the Intrusion Detection Force (IDF), that would protect organizations and defend the Internet as a whole. The paper provides a blueprint of the IDF, where we discuss the requirements to deploy such an infrastructure, and describe its architecture and design in terms of its basic building blocks and major components. We also describe a few at:applications of the IDF architecture, and provide a small experimental prototype that we are currently extending as part of our vision to implement the full IDF infrastructure.","","0-7695-1886-9;0769518869","","10.1109/IWIAS.2003.1192460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192460","","Cities and towns;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Privacy;Protection;Prototypes;TCPIP","Internet;computer network reliability;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security","IDF architecture;IDS;Internet-scale intrusion detection;Intrusion Detection Force;fault tolerance;global Internet-scale defense infrastructure;information sharing;inter-organizational communication;sophisticated attack detection;survivability","","7","","28","","","24-24 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The devices cooperate to monitor one or more physical phenomena within an area of interest. WSNs operate as stochastic systems because of randomness in the monitored environments. For long service time and low maintenance cost, WSNs require adaptive and robust methods to address data exchange, topology formulation, resource and power optimization, sensing coverage and object detection, and security challenges. In these problems, sensor nodes are used to make optimized decisions from a set of accessible strategies to achieve design goals. This survey reviews numerous applications of the Markov decision process (MDP) framework, a powerful decision-making tool to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for WSNs. Furthermore, various solution methods are discussed and compared to serve as a guide for using MDPs in WSNs.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2420686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7080987","Markov decision processes (MDPs);Wireless sensor networks;decision making tools;decision-making tools;multi-agent systems;optimization methods;stochastic control","Complexity theory;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Optimization;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;decision making;wireless sensor networks","MDP framework;Markov decision processes;WSN;data exchange;object detection;power optimization;sensing coverage;stochastic systems;topology formulation;wireless sensor networks","","3","","164","","2015-04-07","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","978-1-4673-6617-5;9781467366175","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed.

We first identify worm characteristics through their behavior, and then classify worm detection algorithms based on the parameters used in the algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network requires realistic modeling of intrusion detection system since most of WSNs are application specific. In WSN, nodes have specific properties such as stable neighbors' information that helps in detection of anomalies in network. Nodes monitor their neighborhood and collaborate with cluster head to detect malicious behavior.

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key benefit of a collaborative approach to intrusion detection is a better view of global network attack activity. Augmenting the information obtained at a single site with information gathered from across the network can provide a more precise model of an attacker's behavior and intent. While many organizations see value in adopting such a collaborative approach, some challenges must be addressed before intrusion detection can be performed on an inter-organizational scale. We report on our experience developing and deploying a decentralized system for efficiently distributing alerts to collaborating peers. Our system, worminator, extracts relevant information from alert streams and encodes it in bloom filters. This information forms the basis of a distributed watchlist.

In this paper, we present efficient schemes for analyzing and optimizing the time duration for which the intrusion detection systems need to remain active in a mobile ad hoc network. A probabilistic model is proposed that makes use of cooperation between IDSs among neighborhood nodes to reduce their individual active time. Usually, an IDS has to run all the time on every node to oversee the network behavior. This can turn out to be a costly overhead for a battery-powered mobile device in terms of power and computational resources. Hence, in this work our aim is to reduce the duration of active time of the IDSs without compromising on their effectiveness.

"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","Z. Zhang; F. Nait-Abdesselam; S. Djahel","LIFL, Univ. of Sci. & Technol. of Lille, Lille","2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","20080815","2008","","","606","613","While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-2201-2;9781424422012","978-1-4244-2202-9;9781424422029","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges. We also provide broader and deeper insight to many other issues that are of paramount importance for the successful deployment and wider acceptance of WMNs.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4300987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300987","","Airports;Costs;Educational institutions;IP networks;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;radio access networks;wireless LAN","Internet service provisioning;Web-in-the-sky;Wi-Fi hotspots;backhaul network access;broadband wireless Internet connectivity;extensive cabling;multihop wireless communication;network layer;network service provider;wireless mesh network","","67","1","32","","","August 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Accordingly, MANET is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. One of the most popular MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to different attacks is ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network. The simulation results show that the backbone network is trustable, has dynamic behavior, and has good coverage.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116020","AODV;Backbone;MANET;Security","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;AODV security;MANET routing protocol;ad hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;mobile backbone network;node reliability;route discovery process;routing attacks;secure technique","","0","","22","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4;9780769534954","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","4","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method relies on the huge potential provided by the mixture between software modules developed in low-level or high-level software languages with modules developed in powerful numerical-oriented software (Matlab/Simulink) to increase the accuracy of data processing. The main result of this paper is the implementation know-how for an intelligent mixed system that use both hardware and software resources for proofing a wireless sensor network.","","978-1-4244-7538-4;9781424475384","","10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2010.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558081","data interfacing;data security;intelligent systems;software;wireless sensor networks","Base stations;Data processing;Hardware;Mathematical model;Software;Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks","high level languages;security of data;software engineering;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Matlab;Simulink;data processing;high-level software languages;intelligent devices;intelligent mixed system;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes discovery;network communication;numerical-oriented software;software development;wireless sensor network security","","0","","18","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection network (IDN) is a collaborative IDS network intended to overcome this weakness by allowing IDS peers to share detection knowledge and experience, and hence improve the overall accuracy of intrusion assessment. In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the security features of GUIDEX against free riders, dishonest insiders and DoS attacks.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.121214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354280","Intrusion detection systems;collaborative networks;game theory;incentive compatibility;network optimization;network security and economics","Communication networks;Computer crime;Computer security;Economics;Intrusion detection;Security;Telecommunication services","Internet;computer network security;game theory","DoS attacks;GUIDEX IDN system;IDS peers;Nash equilibrium;collaborative IDS network;detection knowledge;discrete event simulation;dishonest insiders;free riders;game-theoretic incentive-based mechanism;game-theoretic modeling;intrusion assessment;intrusion detection networks;intrusion detection systems;iterative algorithm;resource management component;security features;trust management","","3","","33","","","December 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value.

In CIDSs, a number of IDS sensors work together for creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Our contribution in this paper is a novel distributed and scalable CIDS, called SkipMon. Our system supports, both, the idea of locality and privacy preserving communication by means of exchanging compact alert data. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for interconnecting sensors that experience similar traffic patterns.

In our AAL scenario, these objects collect and transfer real-time information about the patients to the hospital server with the help of Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. Simulation results show that the chosen protocol is totally resilient against DoS attack and can be one of the best candidates for secure routing in IoT-based AAL applications.","","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454499","Ambient Assisted Living;Denial of Service;Internet of Things;Network Layer Attacks;Routing Protocol;Security;Wireless Mesh Network;eHealthcare","Computer crime;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;computer network security;routing protocols;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet of things;IoT-based ambient assisted living applications;data packet delivery ratio;denial of service attacks;wireless mesh network;wireless mesh routing protocol","","","","21","","","14-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4673-2433-5;9781467324335","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this paper is to find mitigation actions for attacks that might be launched against AMI. The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a performance metric to significantly improve the development and the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment.

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""denial of service"" (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""cross layer based intrusion detection system""(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message.

This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis.

However, the construction of such a security system is a delicate process involving: (i) the acquisition of the monitored program behavior and its storage in a compact way, (ii) the generation of a monitor detecting deviances in the program behavior. These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs.

These technologies have support of one of famous technique known as Adhoc Network. Adhoc Networks are assortment of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and also receiving attention in the scientific community. In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account. Proposed method optimizes the routing issues by using AODV. The result of this paper is an appropriate solution against neighbor attacks.","","978-1-4244-9683-9;9781424496839","","10.1109/EAIT.2011.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734955","AODV;MANETs;adhoc routing;flow capacity;ns2;relative position;signal strength","Ad hoc networks;Equations;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","Internet;mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology","GNDA;Internet technology;MANET;adhoc routing protocol;communication technology;flow capacity;good neighbor node detection;mobile node assortment;network topology;signal strength;wireless link;wireless technology","","0","","14","","","19-20 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In the paper we present a protocol specification based on the DHB-KEY scheme and its implementation for the well known TinyOS platform.

Intrusion detection models are used to detect the attacks based on the patterns and alerts in case of intruders are being met with the system. In this paper, we propose and implement intrusion-detection system grounded on artificial neural network model such as Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based competitive network, which in turn plays a vital role in detection of malicious nodes based on input data patterns. The proposed model deals with different types of attacks and their detection approach based on SOM model. The approach aids at increasing Detection rate as well as reducing the False alarm rate, which in turn helps to detect those attacks before it makes larger damage to the network and prevent them with supportive techniques and increase the network performance.

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","1095-2055;10952055","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","18","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks.

The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack.

It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX).

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism not only increases the overall lifetime of a network, but also decreases the amount of imposed communication overhead on the network in comparison with the traditional leader selection algorithms.","2156-9711;21569711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686474","Bargaining game;Incentive mechanism;Leader selection;MANETs;Price-based systems;Self-organizing networks","Ad hoc networks;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Lead;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Protocols","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks","MANETs;bargaining games;battery depletion;communication overhead;incentive-based leader selection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc networks;selfish nodes","","0","","14","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857;10609857","0-7695-2995-X;076952995X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study.

Especially with resource constraints in dynamic networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), security needs to be of particular consideration. In this paper, we first analyze the solution concept involved in optimizing resource allocation and data packet forwarding. In a MANET, the availability of having data packets forwarded may be insubstantial due to the presence of selfish nodes. Nodes may not want to participate in the network to preserve their own resources. We propose a packet-forwarding problem model with a negotiation game, where an arbitrator acts as a cluster head and initiates a bargaining game. Thereafter, we consider the possibility of having some group of nodes exhibit malicious behavior and collude to subvert the MANET. We investigate the problem by finding the optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies of the negotiation game. Then, we simulate the effect of the coalition of malicious nodes in a mobile environment. Simulation results support our model.","","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490630","MANET;arbitrator;collusion;malicious nodes;negotiation game;network security","Ad hoc networks;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Reliability;Resource management;Security","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;arbitrator cluster head;bargaining game initiation;colluding nodes;data packet forwarding;game theory;mobile ad hoc network;negotiation game;optimal Nash equilibrium strategy;packet forwarding problem model;resource allocation","","","","17","","","18-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The next generation of IDSs should be designed incorporating reasoning engines supported by contextual information about the network, cognitive information from the network users and situational awareness to improve their detection results. In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

In this paper, we propose a distributed scheme to dynamically select nodes with master key shares to provide the private key generation service.

The efficiency of an Intrusion detection system in the case of an adhoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection. The advantage of this approach entails is the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes for reestablishing network monitors.","2154-7491;21547491","978-0-7695-3489-3;9780769534893","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737122","Adhoc Networks;Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms","Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system protection;Watches;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cellular automata;monitoring;telecommunication security","IDFADNWCA algorithm;cellular automata;distributed agent based intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;iterative power optimal solution;network-monitoring node;power level metric;wireless adhoc network","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision.

Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes.

The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election.

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4799-0453-2;9781479904532","978-1-4799-0452-5;9781479904525","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4;9781479968954","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","1","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We compared two different adaptive network responses to these attacks against a baseline of no response for 10 and 20 node networks. Each response reflects a level of trust assigned to the captured node. Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as ""goodput"", i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit. We show that the best network response depends on the mission goals, network configuration, density, network performance, attacker skill, and degree of compromise.","","0-7803-8140-8;0780381408","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290104","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Communications technology;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing","ad hoc networks;military communication;telecommunication network routing","adaptive network;data swallowing attack;denial of service attack;on-demand distance vector routing algorithm;passive attacker;system adaptation;tactical ad hoc networks;tactical communications;trust response","","0","","5","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","0-7803-9410-0;0780394100","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","20","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed.

Much of the literature on fault-tolerant distributed systems focuses on local error recovery by masking the effects of faults. We describe a direction for error recovery in the face of catastrophic faults, where the effects of the faults cannot be masked using available resources. The goal is to provide continued service that is either an alternate or degraded service by reconfiguring the system rather than masking faults.

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","7","4","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Keane","School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.","IEEE Access","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Node compromise attacks pose a serious threat to WSNs. To launch an attack, an adversary physically captures a node and access data or software stored on the node. Even worse, the adversary may redeploy the captured node back into the network and use it to launch further attacks. To reduce the impact of a node compromise attack on network operations, the network should detect a node compromise as early as possible, ideally soon after a node is being captured, and then isolate the node from future network communications. Solutions for early node compromise detection are based on distributed monitoring of neighbouring nodes’ aliveness. Nodes regularly send notification (Heartbeat) messages to their one-hop neighbors to indicate their aliveness. If no message is received from a node (i.e., if a node is not heard) for a certain period of time, then the unheard node is said to have been compromised. This approach may have a large number of false positive errors when the message loss ratio in the network is high, as missing messages could be caused by message loss during transmission, in addition to node compromises. This paper proposes a novel scheme, called an Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection (AdaptENCD) scheme, to facilitate node compromise attack detection in a cluster-based WSN. The scheme is designed to achieve a low false positive ratio in the presence of various levels of message loss ratios. To achieve this feature, two ideas are used in the design. The first is to use cluster-based collective decision making to detect node compromises. The second is to dynamically adjust the rate of notification message transmissions in response to the message loss ratio in the sender’s neighborhood. The performance of the scheme, in terms of false positive ratio, false negative ratio and transmission overheads, is evaluated using simulation. The results are compared against those from the most relevant scheme in the literature. The comparison results show- that our scheme can detect all the node compromises in the network more effectively and efficiently, regardless of the message loss ratio in the underlying environment.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2594478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530851","Node compromise attack;Wireless Sensor Networks;adaptive;detection","Adaptation models;Network security;Propagation losses;Telecommunication network management;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","2016-08-03","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable. In this paper we design and implement a preliminary intrusion detection system (IDS) for WSNs that addresses the security concern of DoS attacks and fits the demands and restrictions of WSNs.","2154-0357;21540357","978-1-4244-0940-2;9781424409402","978-1-4244-0941-9;9781424409419","10.1109/EIT.2007.4374444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374444","Attack;Denial of Service (DoS);Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Network","Batteries;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Event detection;Floods;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","denial of service attacks;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","5","","15","","","17-20 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes are deployed randomly over an area in order to sense various physical phenomena related parameters. The nodes sense the data within their vicinity and forward the data to the neighboring nodes so as to forward the data towards the base station. However, there may be few malicious nodes present in the network and these nodes falsify the data while communicating. This results in false information gathered by the base station and also exhausting the energy of the nodes in the path. Due to the presence of these untrusted nodes the security of the WSN application is compromised as the false data results in distorted information. So it is necessary to study a trust model, various security threats and their effect on WSN. Trust is essential among the nodes in the WSN so that the data can be forwarded without being modified or distorted. This work examines malicious node attack in the WSN scenario and the energy consumption. In this work TRMsim-WSN simulator has been made use of to model the trust and various security attacks and energy consumption analysis with respective to client nodes, relay nodes and malicious nodes has been carried out.","","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7457012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457012","WSN;malicious;security;trust","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","WSN application;base station;malicious nodes;neighboring nodes;security threats;tiny nodes;trust model;wireless sensor network","","","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","2154-0217;21540217","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor.

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4577-0637-0;9781457706370","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wired networks the attacker needs to gain access to the physical media to make an attack. In wireless networks the scenario is much different, there are no firewalls and gateways in place hence attacks can take place from any location within radio coverage area. Each mobile node in ad-hoc network is an autonomous unit in itself free to move independently. This means a node with not adequate physical protection is very much susceptible to be compromised. It is difficult to track down a single compromised node in a large network, attacks stemming from a compromised node are far more detrimental and much harder to detect.","","978-1-4799-0322-1;9781479903221","","10.1109/JNS3.2013.6595459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595459","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Survey;VANET","Computational modeling;Databases;Encryption;Irrigation;Logic gates;Monitoring;Vehicular ad hoc networks","digital signatures;telecommunication network routing;vehicular ad hoc networks","Sybil attack;VANET member nodes;autonomous unit;blackhole attack;centralized decision making architecture;cooperative participation;decentralized architecture;denial of service;digital signature;encryption;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;physical media;routing information;security measures;selective forwarding;vehicular ad-hoc network;wired networks;wireless links;wireless networks","","1","","17","","","26-27 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect the valuable data of their clients, organizations implement security systems to detect and prevent security breaches. But since the intruders are using sophisticated techniques to penetrate the systems, even the highly reputed secured systems have become vulnerable now. To deal with the current scenario, advanced level of researches are required to be carried out to invent more sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Among various methodologies, researchers consider Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a very effective and popular tool for developing an IDS. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient BPNN architecture for the development of an anomaly based IDS with high accuracy and detection rate. The KDD'99 data set is used in this context to develop the architecture.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065641","Anomaly detection;Artificial neural network;BPNN;Intrusion Detection System;KDD '99 data set;Network security","Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;neural nets","BPNN architecture;anomaly based IDS;anomaly based intrusion detection system;back propagation neural network architecture;client data;robust supervised learning neural network;security breach detection;security breach prevention;security system;security vulnerability;valuable data protection","","0","","25","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network functions virtualization together with software-defined networking can be used to efficiently coordinate different network security functionality in the network. To squeeze the best out of network capabilities, there is need for algorithms for optimal placement of the security functionality in the cloud infrastructure. However, due to the large number of flows to be considered and complexity of interactions in these networks, the classical placement algorithms are not scalable. To address this issue, we elaborate an optimization framework, namely OCDO, that provides adequate and scalable network security provisioning and deployment in the cloud. Our approach is based on an innovative multistage approach that combines together decomposition and segmentation techniques to the problem of security functions placement while coping with the complexity and the scalability of such an optimization problem. We present the results of multiple scenarios to assess the efficiency and the adequacy of our framework. We also describe our prototype implementation of the framework integrated into an open source cloud framework, i.e. Open stack.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4673-7286-2;9781467372862","","10.1109/CLOUD.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214092","Cloud;Decomposition;OpenStack;Optimization;SDN;Security Provisioning;Segmentation","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Network topology;Optimization;Security;Servers;Topology","cloud computing;optimisation;security of data","SDN-based cloud;cloud computing;innovative multistage approach;multistage OCDO;scalable network security provisioning;scalable security provisioning optimization framework;security functionality;software-defined networking","","0","","16","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The specification of the security requirements and capabilities of a service and its consumer in policy alternatives, and their combination to find the applicable policy is difficult. Currently, security policy compatibility is difficult to achieve as the algorithm only considers the syntactic evaluation of policy alternatives, leading to inconsistent policies that required further investigation. The evaluation of the security provided by a set of policy alternatives, the related effect that policy alternatives and environmental influences have on each other is not considered. This paper presents a design of an evaluation tool that can assist administrators to determine the level of security supported by a web services security policy.

To implement a reasonable control strategy, a minimal set of routers is computed in a network that can be used to control and reduce damage done by a large-scale attack such as worm or DDOS attacks. Our work focuses on large network while previous works focus on LANs. We proposed rules to choose these routers based on the network topology and based on risk assessment. Many topological factors are considered into the control strategy process, the control router sets selecting algorithm based on entropy was put forward. According to the incidents distribution on the topology, the factor of macroscopic epidemic status is proposed by the method of quantitative and qualitative analysis, which offers administrators the direct decisive advice to prevent network security event from overspreading and minimize the costs.
