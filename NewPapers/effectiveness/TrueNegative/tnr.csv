The study is carried out on two patients named CHIMIC and JANPRZ who were diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy and were subsequently operated. Along with EEG recordings, inter-ictal discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, structural placement of the epileptogenic zone and clinical description, are used in the study. The key step involved in the analysis, is to create an algorithm that shapes the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, identifying the features, forward modeling of the extracted features and finally classifying them as epileptic seizures arising from the location on the right or left region of the brain. The feature extraction is done by independent component analysis (ICA) with spatially filtered eight spectral features per components. These features are classified using Support Vector Machines with radial basis function kernels (SVM) and Proximal SVM. A comparative study is done for evaluating specificity and sensitivity using segments of ICA data. The analysis and results of both patients indicates that the specificity and sensitivity ratios are higher for ICA with SVM rather than those obtained from PSVM.

Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection,Y. Meng; L. f. Kwok,"Dept. of Comput. Sci., City Univ. of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",20131212,2013,,,241,248,"False alarms are a big challenge for intrusion detection systems (IDSs). A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.",2324-898X;2324898X,,,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847,Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection,Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement,information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data,IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation,,1,,24,,,16-18 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Measurement-based Anomaly Detection Techniques,Seong Soo Kim; A. L. N. Reddy,"Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA",26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'06),20060724,2006,,,6,6,A number of recent studies have proposed measurement based approaches to network traffic analysis. These techniques treat traffic volume and traffic header data as signals or images in order to make analysis feasible. We use trace-driven experiments and compare the performance of different strategies. Our evaluations on real traces reveal differences in the effectiveness of different traffic header data as potential signals for traffic analysis in terms of their detection rates and false alarm rates.

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; K. Salamatian,"Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.",1530-1346;15301346,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942,Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort,Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV,feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data,MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component,,0,,19,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers.

Mundada,"Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India",2012 Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2012),20120213,2012,,,1,8,"Most organizations deploy Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor network activities for signs of security violations and these systems generate alerts whenever a known intrusion signature is detected in the network traffic. However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts.

Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

Intrusion detection based on Neuro-Fuzzy classification,I. Gaied; F. Jemili; O. Korbaa,"Modeling of Automated Reasoning (MARS), Tunisia, Monastir",2015 IEEE/ACS 12th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA),20160709,2015,,,1,8,"Computer security is far from being guaranteed due to the scalability of computer networks, the constant evolution of risks and the presence of noisy information. Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model.

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.",,978-1-4673-2906-4;9781467329064,,10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310,Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine,,Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines,BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity,,9,,23,,,4-6 Jan. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

As a part of the preprocessing step, an illumination compensation based segmentation algorithm is deployed. The segmentation process is followed by the proposed iterative dilation method to remove noise from a lesion.

Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated.

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

In this paper we investigate the type of issues faced when deploying a cloud computing management infrastructure and propose a solution to self-assist the deployment. We show how by leveraging virtual image technologies we can detect faulty installations and their signatures early in the deployment process.

Annual",20081222,2008,,,279,288,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a crucial element of a network security posture. One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules.

Behavior-based intrusion detection in encrypted environments,R. Koch; M. Golling; G. D. Rodosek,"Univ. der Bundeswehr Munchen, Neubiberg, Germany",IEEE Communications Magazine,20140715,2014,52,7,124,131,"In recent years the Internet has evolved into a critical communication infrastructure that is omnipresent in almost all aspects of our daily life. This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.",0163-6804;01636804,,,10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852093,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852093,,Encryption;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Payloads;Telecommunication network management,Internet;computer network security;cryptography,Internet;behavior-based intrusion detection;data exfiltration;encrypted communication;encrypted environments;malicious activity detection,,0,,13,,,14-Jul,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system.

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms.

Why can people not effectively detect social engineering, or more specifically, the art of deception? What can be done to augment human abilities for the task? The current findings warrant several possibilities that influence human ability to detect deception. Factors include such things as truth-bias, stereotypical thinking and processing ability.

The concept of Kolmogorov complexity is used in many applications like spam filtering, data compression, information assurance etc. In this paper, we present the application of Kolmogorov complexity in network security field, particularly for anomaly detection. In order to accomplish that, it is assumed that most of the network attacks change the structure of the traffic. This enforces anomaly and hence subsequent intrusion can be detected if the structure or signature of the traffic flow is investigated. From this notion, we propose a signature based anomaly detection scheme. We show through simulation results that with the help of Kolmogorov complexity, we can detect traffic pattern abnormality in a simplistic way.

However according to the Verizon 2014 Data Breach Report: after analysing 10 years of data... organizations cannot keep up with cyber crime-and the bad guys are winning. Although billions are expended worldwide on cyber security, organizations struggle with complexity, e.g., the NISTIR 7628 guidelines for cyber-physical systems are over 600 pages of text. And there is a lack of information visibility. Organizations must bridge the gap between technical cyber operations and the business/social priorities since both sides are essential for ensuring cyber security. Identifying visual structures for information synthesis could help reduce the complexity while increasing information visibility within organizations. This paper lays the foundation for investigating such visual structures by first identifying where current visual structures are succeeding or failing. To do this, we examined publicly available analyses related to three types of security issues: 1) epidemic, 2) cyber attacks on an industrial network, and 3) threat of terrorist attack. We found that existing visual structures are largely inadequate for reducing complexity and improving information visibility. However, based on our analysis, we identified a range of different visual structures, and their possible trade-offs/limitation is framing strategies for cyber policy.

In behavior-based approaches to anomaly detection, the model of normal behavior is constructed from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns. Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Quantitative results are given for the recognition ability of contiguous-bits matching together with permutations.",1083-4419;10834419,,,10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817026,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262509,,Artificial immune systems;Biological systems;Computer science;Detectors;Distributed processing;Intrusion detection;Iron;Object detection;Pattern matching;Random variables,evolutionary computation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;string matching,anomalous pattern detection;anomaly detection;partial matching rule;pattern recognition;positive pattern detection;r-chunk rule,,47,1,69,,,Feb. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques.

Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation.

QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. We proposed a novel method for detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals using Network Intrusion Detection technique used for detection of worm in networking applications for finding the frequently repeated strings in a packet stream. A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature. We use the concept of shared counters to minimize the memory requirement while efficiently shifting through suspicious strings. The algorithm automatically adjusts parameters periodically to adapt to ECG changes as QRS morphology and heart rate.

To do so, organizations install security devices such as intrusion prevention systems to monitor network traffic. However, data that are collected by these devices are often imperfect. The contribution of this paper is to try to define some practical metrics based on imperfect data collected by an intrusion prevention system. Since attacks greatly differ, we propose to group the attacks into several attack type groups. We then define a set of metrics for each attack type group. We introduce an approach that consists in analyzing the evolution of these metrics per attack type group by focusing on outliers in order to give an insight into an organizationpsilas security. The method is assessed for an organization of about 40,000 computers.

Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories.

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters.

Learning of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Using Density Estimate,W. Stach; W. Pedrycz; L. A. Kurgan,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)",20120511,2012,42,3,900,912,"Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are convenient and widely used architectures for modeling dynamic systems, which are characterized by a great deal of flexibility and adaptability. Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.",1083-4419;10834419,,,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163,Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs),Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors,cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence),SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms,"Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated",6,,49,,2/14/2012,12-Jun,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type opportunistic adversaries. This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats.

Existing attack detection approaches based on statistical learning methods may generate misleading decision boundaries when processing noisy data with such a mixture of benign and malicious behaviors.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

Eagle: User profile-based anomaly detection for securing Hadoop clusters,C. Gupta; R. Sinha; Y. Zhang,"eBay Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","Big Data (Big Data), 2015 IEEE International Conference on",20151228,2015,,,1336,1343,"Existing Big data analytics platforms, such as Hadoop, lack support for user activity monitoring. Several diagnostic tools such as Ganglia, Ambari, and Cloudera Manager are available to monitor health of a cluster, however, they do not provide algorithms to detect security threats or perform user activity monitoring. Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable system that can detect malicious user activities, especially in real-time, so that appropriate actions can be taken against the user. At eBay, we developed such a system named Eagle, which collects audit logs from Hadoop clusters and applications running on them, analyzes users behavior, generates profiles per user of the system, and predicts anomalous user activities based on their prior profiles. Eagle is a highly scalable system, capable of monitoring multiple eBay clusters in real-time. It includes machine-learning algorithms that create user profiles based on the user's history of activities. As far as we know, this is the first activity monitoring system on the Hadoop-ecosystem for the detection of intrusion-related activities using behavior-based profiles of users. When a user performs any operation in the cluster, Eagle matches current user action against his prior activity pattern and raises alarm if it suspects anomalous action. We investigate two machine-learning algorithms: density estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we introduce the Eagle system, discuss the algorithms in detail, and show performance results. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the density estimation algorithm is 93%, however the sensitivity of our system increases by 4.94% (on average) to 98% (approximately) by using an ensemble of the two algorithms during anomaly detection.",,,,10.1109/BigData.2015.7363892,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363892,Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster;machine learning;user activity monitoring;user profiles,Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Training,Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data,Big data analytics;Eagle system;Hadoop cluster;Hadoop-ecosystem;PCA;density estimation;eBay;intrusion-related activity;machine-learning algorithm;principal component analysis;security threat;user profile-based anomaly detection,,,,30,,,Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users private lives.

Applic., Pailan Coll. of Manage. & Technol., Kolkata, India","Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks (CICN), 2014 International Conference on",20150326,2014,,,1052,1056,"The problem of intrusion is gradually becoming nightmare for several organizations. To protect the valuable data of their clients, organizations implement security systems to detect and prevent security breaches. But since the intruders are using sophisticated techniques to penetrate the systems, even the highly reputed secured systems have become vulnerable now. To deal with the current scenario, advanced level of researches are required to be carried out to invent more sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Among various methodologies, researchers consider Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a very effective and popular tool for developing an IDS. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient BPNN architecture for the development of an anomaly based IDS with high accuracy and detection rate. The KDD'99 data set is used in this context to develop the architecture.",,978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289,,10.1109/CICN.2014.221,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065641,Anomaly detection;Artificial neural network;BPNN;Intrusion Detection System;KDD '99 data set;Network security,Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training,backpropagation;computer network security;neural nets,BPNN architecture;anomaly based IDS;anomaly based intrusion detection system;back propagation neural network architecture;client data;robust supervised learning neural network;security breach detection;security breach prevention;security system;security vulnerability;valuable data protection,,0,,25,,,14-16 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Reducing false positives through fuzzy alert correlation in collaborative intelligent intrusion detection systems  A review,H. T. Elshoush; I. M. Osman,"Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, University of Khartoum, Sudan","Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ), 2010 IEEE International Conference on",20100923,2010,,,1,8,"As complete prevention of computer attacks is not possible, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a very important role in minimizing the damage caused by different computer attacks. There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.",1098-7584;10987584,978-1-4244-6919-2;9781424469192,,10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584418,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584418,,Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Correlation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols,security of data,collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system;computer attacks;false positives;fuzzy alert correlation;fuzzy logic,,2,,25,,,18-23 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
