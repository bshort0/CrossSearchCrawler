The requirements were developed from both experimental evaluations and computer simulations. This paper gives details of how the PDS 100 PIDS was set up to meet these requirements at an operational site with 30 detection zones. The procedures used were designed to be rigorous enough to ensure that the performance was acceptable, yet quick enough to minimise the time spent commissioning. The tests are based on a calibrated, nondestructive fence tester used to simulate real cutting attacks on the fence. Data from attack trials were used to correlate the signals from real attacks and the fence tester. The commissioning procedure involved one person striking each fence panel, while the generated signals were automatically recorded on a portable computer. This data was used to determine the minimum sensitivity needed for each zone that would have met the required detection rate","","0-7803-1479-4;0780314794","","10.1109/CCST.1994.363775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=363775","","Site security monitoring;TV surveillance systems","alarm systems;commissioning;digital simulation;safety systems","commissioning;computer simulations;minimum probability of detection;nondestructive fence tester;performance standard;perimeter intrusion detection system;portable computer;sensitivity;weather conditions","","0","","5","","","12-14 Oct 1994","12 Oct 1994-14 Oct 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach has potential for comparative emotion recognition accuracy when coupled with MLP.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836608","CMAC;EEG;emotion classification;feature extraction;latent features","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","CMAC;EEG signals;KDE;MFCC;MLP classifier;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;PSD;calm emotion;cerebellar model articulation controller;classification performance;computational cerebellar model;data-driven self-organizing feature map;emotion classification;emotion recognition accuracy;fear emotion;feature extraction;happiness emotion;kernel density estimation;multilayer perceptron classifier;power spectrum density;sadness emotion","","0","","28","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It does not require installation of any additional hardware and extra communication costs; its computational requirements are negligible. The proposed technique ma be used in both hierarchical and flat WSNs. The paper contains recommendations to the choice of threshold value for each traffic parameter.

Since it is not technically feasible to build a system with no vulnerabilities, intrusion detection (ID) has become an important area for researches. An intrusion that deviates only slightly from a pattern derived from the audit data may not be detected or a small change in normal behavior may cause a wrong data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) offer techniques for modeling and recognizing normal and abusive system behavior. GAs can be successfully used to tune the membership functions used by the IDS.

This is due to the flawed assumption that an attacker does not have any information about an ADS. Advanced persistent threats that are capable of monitoring network behavior can always estimate some information about ADSs which makes these ADSs susceptible to evasion attacks. Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate the design methodology and extensive experimentation is performed to corroborate the results.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346858","","Detectors;Entropy;Estimation;Grippers;Intrusion detection;Parameter estimation","computer network security","anomaly detection system evasion;evade detection;intrusion detection system;key based randomization scheme;launch evasion attack;parameter estimation attacks","","","","24","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed. We use real-world traffic and all L7-filter protocol patterns to make our experiments, and the results show that the system achieves at Gbps level throughout in 4-cores Servers.","","978-1-4244-8133-0;9781424481330","","10.1109/NAS.2010.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575653","","Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Instruction sets;Message systems;Payloads;Protocols","telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","CMP architecture;L7-filter protocol patterns;application-level protocol distribution of network traffic;deep packet inspection technology;fast traffic classification;memory-efficient traffic classification","","3","","25","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized.

A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

The new sequences are then fed to a naive Bayes supervised classifier (SC2.2) that builds class conditional probabilities from Markov modeling of system call sequences. The results of our proposed two-stage (that is clustering followed by classification) intrusion detection system on the 1999 DARPA dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab show significant performance improvements in terms of false positive rate, while maintaining a high detection rate when compared with other classifiers.

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept. A total of 22 cyber-physical scenarios are mapped into CEG and Bayesian networks to define rules for cyber-power system events.","1932-5517;19325517","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939285","Bayesian network;CEG;EDS;cyber-physical;scenarios;synchrophasor","Bayes methods;Circuit faults;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Relays","belief networks;graph theory;phasor measurement;power transmission lines;power transmission protection","Bayesian networks;IEEE 9 bus system;causal event graph;cyber-physical attack threats;cyber-power system events;event detection systems;multizone distance protection;power system event identification;robust monitoring systems;synchrophasor technology;transmission lines","","0","","18","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","23","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. The efficiency of this method has been evaluated by the data set originated from New Mexico University.","","0-7803-8403-2;0780384032","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382325","","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Speech recognition;Text recognition","artificial intelligence;hidden Markov models;radial basis function networks;security of data","artificial intelligence tool;hard decision process;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;neural network model;profile database;radial basis function model","","1","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070;02780070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","2","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.","2164-7143;21647143","978-1-4577-1676-8;9781457716768","","10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121657","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 01 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 01 fractional programming","Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Programming;Testing;Training;Training data","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;set theory;tree searching","EnFS measure;branch-and- bound algorithm;ensemble feature selection measures;globally optimal feature subsets;heuristic search strategy;intrusion detection system;linear programming problem;machine learning algorithm;noncomprehensive consideration;over fitting phenomenon;pattern recognition system;representative feature;statistical property;test pattern classification","","0","","15","","","22-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of intrusion detection systems have been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature. It can also detect low intensity attacks and attack switching behaviors which have been the major shortcoming of most of the existing IDS for Wireless Networks.","","978-1-61284-689-7;9781612846897","","10.1109/ISCI.2011.5959000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959000","Cross Layer Approach;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Mesh Networks;multi layer attacks","Cross layer design;Delay;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Throughput","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","MAC layer attacks;ad-hoc networks;attack switching behaviors;cross layer based intrusion detection system;distributed cross layer approach;encryption software;low intensity attacks;multihop decentralized architecture;multilayer attacks;multilayer security attacks;secure communication;secure routing path;wireless mesh networks;wireless multihop networks","","1","","18","","","20-23 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In such events, an entire collection of remote hosts together probes the address space monitored by a sensor in some sort of coordinated fashion. Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet. Cross-validating with data from DShield shows that our inferences exhibit promising accuracy.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2086445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599296","Botnet;computer network security;global property extrapolation;honeynet;scan strategy inference;site security monitoring;situational awareness;statistical inference","","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","attack landscape;cross validation;darknet avoidance;honeynet data;indiscriminant attack;large-scale botnet probing events;malicious probing traffic;probing activity;scanning strategy;situational awareness","","9","","28","","2010-10-11","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on the angle detection accuracy of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme, which is one of primary factors for rapid establishment of FSO links. The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data. The simulation results indicate that this new method can provide high-precision positioning of the laser beams, and the maximum angle detection error of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme can be less than 0.054 (0.94 mrad).","0733-8724;07338724","","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2360313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915668","Fisheye lens calibration;fisheye lens calibration;free space optical link;high-accuracy angle detection;spot location;ultra-wide field-of-view acquisition;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition","Accuracy;Imaging;Interpolation;Laser beams;Lenses;Measurement by laser beam;Optical fiber communication","calibration;laser beams;lenses;optical communication equipment;optical images;optical links;optical projectors;photodetectors","Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter;centroid locating algorithm;fisheye lens calibration algorithm;fisheye lens projection model;free-space optical links;high-accuracy angle detection;high-precision laser beam positioning;incident angle;incident beam imaging spot;integrated optics;natural neighbor interpolation algorithm;ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition scheme","","1","","21","","2014-10-02","Dec.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions. Finally, intra-domain information exposition is evaluated, showing the PAD ability to preserve confidentiality.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.111113.130482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662354","BGP;Multi-domain networks;PCE;control plane security;sequential hypothesis testing;traffic engineering","Computer architecture;Network security;Network topology;Quality of service;Statistical analysis","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;message authentication;quality of service;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","PAD;PCE anomaly detector;PCE architecture;QoS-enabled end-to-end connectivity services;SHT;TE solutions;anomaly-based approach;attack patterns;authentication;authorization;bogus requests;encryption;end-to-end path computations;information confidentiality;inter-PCE path computation;intradomain information exposition;intradomain information exposure;malicious PCE;malicious utilization detection;multidomain multiprovider networks;network load conditions;network providers;path computation element;security leak;sequential hypothesis testing;smart confidentiality attacks;statistical classification procedure;statistical detection;traffic engineering","","1","","","","2013-11-12","December 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper.

Machine learning approaches have been widely investigated in anomaly detection systems. However, despite multiple academic researches, such systems are rarely employed in operational settings. They suffer from long time training, lack of good quality training data and a random selection of features (training attributes).

This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries. Finally, we present the implementation and performance evaluation of four popular network traffic monitoring applications built on top of Scap.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901242","Traffic monitoring;overload control;packet capture;packet filtering;performance;stream reassembly","Instruction sets;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Packet loss;Protocols","parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Scap;Stream capture library;TCP segmentation;TCP stream reassembly;connection-oriented analysis;data movement operations;high-speed network;intrusion detection;multicore architectures;network monitoring;parallel processing;stream-oriented network traffic capture;stream-oriented traffic processing;traffic classification","","2","","54","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the inherent vulnerabilities of wireless medium and node mobility make such network highly susceptible to malicious attacks.

Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge. It can be used as a knowledge-base for developing sophisticated intelligent network forensics systems to support complex chain of reasoning. We use a real life network intrusion scenario to show how our ontology can be integrated and used in intelligent network forensics systems.","","978-1-4244-7551-3;9781424475513","978-1-4244-7549-0;9781424475490","10.1109/PST.2010.5593235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593235","","Cognition;Forensics;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Ontologies;Problem-solving","computer forensics;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer networks;information architecture;intelligent network forensics analysis;machine learning techniques;ontology engineering;problem solving knowledge;semantic-web","","2","","15","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
