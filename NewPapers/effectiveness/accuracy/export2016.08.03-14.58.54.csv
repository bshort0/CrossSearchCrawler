Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","1","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","1934-5070;19345070","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7;9781424400027","978-1-4244-0003-4;9781424400034","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, securing IoT technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection for low-resource IoT devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e. high detection and low false positive rates).","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510811","Anomaly detection;Game theory;Low-resources devices;Nash equilibrium","Energy consumption;Games;Handwriting recognition;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cryptography;digital signatures;energy consumption;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;attack confirmation;attack pattern detection;cryptography;energy consumption;game-theoretic methodology;intrusion detection system;learning algorithm;lightweight anomaly detection technique;low-resource IoT devices;signature detection","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An organization should find the methods to protect their data and network system to reduce the risk from attacks. Snort Intrusion Detection System (Snort-IDS) is a security tool of network security. It has been widely used for protecting the network of the organizations. The Snort-IDS utilize the rules to matching data packets traffic. If some packet matches the rules, Snort-IDS will generate the alert messages. However, Snort-IDS contain many rules and it also generates a lot of false alerts. In this paper, we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection. In order to test the performance evaluation, we utilized the data set from the MIT-DAPRA 1999, which includes the normal and abnormal traffics. Firstly, we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules. Secondly, we applied the WireShark software to analyze data packets form of attack in data set. Finally, the Snort-IDS was improved, and it can detect the network probe attack. This paper, we had classified the attacks into several groups based on the nature of network probe attack. In addition, we also compared the efficacy of detection attacks between Snort-IDS rules to be updated with the Detection Scoring Truth. As the experimental results, the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth. It can achieve higher accuracy. However, there were some detecting alert that occur over the attack in Detection Scoring Truth, because some attack occur in several time but the Detection Scoring Truth indentify as one time.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2014.6914042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914042","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Network Security;Network probe attack;Snort-IDS rule","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;data analysis","MIT-DAPRA;Snort intrusion detection system;Snort-IDS;WireShark software;abnormal traffics;alert messages;data packet analysis;data packet traffic matching;detection scoring truth;false alerts;network probe attack detection;network protection;network system security;normal traffics;performance evaluation","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","7","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions. Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data.

According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time. At last, the scheme was built in the company's test environment, then the test environment was attacked by penetration test which is to simulate the act of hacking, the feasibility and function of it are verified by the testing.","","","","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502282","Cloud computing;Cloud security;Correlation analysis;Secure Management Scheme;Vulnerability scan","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Correlation;Information security;Servers","Big Data;cloud computing;security of data","Big Data;Nagios;Nikto security tool;Sandcat security tool;Splunk;cloud computing security;correlation analysis;hacker attack detection;information security;regular network security self-testing;secure management scheme;system log collection;test environment;vulnerability scan","","","","27","","","9-10 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163","domain adaptation;flow-based classification","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training","cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols","confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature","","6","","29","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the current research, we present an operation framework and protection mechanism to facilitate a secure environment to protect mobile agents against tampering. The system depends on the presence of an authentication authority. The advantage of the proposed system is that security measures are an integral part of the design, thus common security retrofitting problems do not arise. This is due to the presence of the ElGamal encryption mechanism to protect its confidential content and any collected data by the agent from the visited host. Therefore, eavesdropping on information from the agent no longer reveals any confidential information. Also, the inherent security constraints within the framework allow the system to operate as an intrusion detection system for any mobile agent environment. The mechanism is tested for most well known severe attacks against agents and networked systems. The scheme proved to have promising performance that highly recommends it for the type of transactions that needs highly secure environments, e. g., business to business.","2161-5322;21615322","0-7803-8735-X;078038735X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387089","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Software agents;System testing","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents","ElGamal encryption mechanism;MANET;authentication authority;confidential information;highly secure environments;intrusion detection;mobile agent protection mechanism;secure environment;security constraints;security retrofitting problems","","1","5","18","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We noticed a raising interest to incorporate single Bayesian classifier into the multiple classifiers framework. In this light, this research work explored the possibility of employing multiple classifiers approach, but limited to variations of Bayesian technique, namely Naive Bayes Classifier, Bayesian Networks, and Expert-elicited Bayesian Network. Empirical evaluations were conducted based on a standard network intrusion dataset and the results showed that the multiple Bayesian classifiers approach gave insignificant increase of performance in detecting network intrusions as compared to a single Bayesian classifier. Naives Bayes Classifier should be considered in detecting network intrusions due to its comparable performance with multiple Bayesian classifiers approach. Moreover, time spent for building a NBC was less compared to others.","","978-1-4244-6079-3;9781424460793","978-1-4244-6080-9;9781424460809","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445664","Bayesian Classifiers;Intrusion Detection;Multiple Classifiers","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Computer applications;Computer networks;Data mining;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Niobium compounds","belief networks;security of data","expert-elicited Bayesian network;multiple Bayesian classifiers;naive Bayes classifier;network intrusion detection;single Bayesian classifiers","","0","","16","","","19-21 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding).

Therefore the system checks the identity of the user by their behaviour pattern using keystrokes dynamics to authenticate user. A number of samples of login and password attempts of each user is gathered and stored in a database. From the samples collected, keystroke patterns are derived called feature sets and signatures are formed for each user using Fuzzy Logic algorithms. Once signatures are formed, users are authenticated by comparing their typing pattern to the respective signatures formed. We study the performance of such a system based on features like False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR), thus evaluating the efficiency of the system.","","","","10.1109/ICTSD.2015.7095873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095873","Keystroke dynamics;biometrics;computer security;continuous authentication system;continuous biometric authentication;feature selection;intrusion detection;user typing behaviour;user-independent threshold","Computers;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Standards;Sustainable development;Timing","authorisation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;message authentication","FAR;FRR;false acceptance rate;false rejection rate;feature sets;fuzzy logic membership function;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;typing pattern;user authentication","","0","","6","","","4-6 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period.

Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn.

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.","1541-1672;15411672","978-1-4673-2276-8;9781467322768","","10.1109/IS.2012.6335176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic","BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization","","0","","31","","","6-8 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics.

The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters.

Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) solutions are one of such applications that have dramatically been transformed. This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

The characteristics of VANETs are: an open medium, no traditional security infrastructure, high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, we build an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) for VANETs that uses a Proportional Overlapping Scores (POS) method to reduce the number of features that are extracted from the trace file of VANET behavior and used for classification. These are relevant features that describe the normal or abnormal behavior of vehicles. The IDS uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and fuzzified data to detect black hole attacks. The IDSs use the features extracted from the trace file as auditable data to detect the attack.

Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host.

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, it also lends itself to distributed methods for efficient enforcement of spectrum etiquette. We leverage a crowd of mobile users to implement a paradigm of eye-witness for detecting violations of spectrum policies.

The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application. We show that the annotation overhead is very small, that the performance of the fully automatic static verification is acceptable, and that the performance overhead of the runtime checking is limited.","0098-5589;00985589","","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359468","Data sharing;Reliability;Security;Security and Protection;Software/Program Verification;Web technologies;Web-based services","","Web services;programming languages","J2EE-based e-commerce application;JML annotation language;Web application vulnerabilities;provable protection;security engineering;session data dependencies;software engineering","","2","1","48","","","Jan.-Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

The proposed method creates data clusters at different levels of granulation and selects the best clustering results based on some measures. The proposed method involves merging clusters into new clusters that have a coarser granulation. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, three different datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed method to other classifiers: SVM classifier, FCM fuzzy classifier, subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier. Results show that the proposed method has better classification results than other classifiers for all the datasets used.","","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116825","Fuzzy systems;data classification;data clustering;granular computing","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Input variables;Merging;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering","FCM fuzzy classifier;SVM classifier;automatic generation;coarser granulation;data clustering;fuzzy classification rules;fuzzy modelling;granulation-based adaptive clustering;subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier","","0","","20","","","13-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although encryption helps to increase network security level, it is not sufficient to protect against malicious intruders. An intrusion detection scheme is proposed in this paper based on cross layer feature collection from the medium access control (MAC) and network layers. The proposed method employs an hierarchical configuration that avoids using a clustering algorithm and, instead, sequentially activates the promiscuity (ability to sniff all packets transmitted by nodes within radio range) of the node based on its location in the network. The node in this case acts as a pseudo cluster head (PCH) that collects data from its neighboring nodes in each quadrant in the field and then uses this information to calculate an anomaly index (AI) in each quadrant. The mechanism uses a C4.5 decision tree to learn the network behavior under blackhole attack and is able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to 97% accuracy. The presented approach is twofold - it is energy efficient and has a high degree of intrusion detection with low overhead.","","978-1-4673-8450-6;9781467384506","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430139","","Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","access protocols;cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","C4.5 decision tree;MANET;anomaly index;blackhole attack;clustering algorithm;cross layer intrusion detection;hierarchical configuration;intrusion detection scheme;medium access control;mobile ad hoc network;network security level;pseudocluster head;pseudoclustering scheme;wireless network","","","","15","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attackspsila features for improving the preventive algorithms. The traditional intrusion detection algorithms canpsilat be applied directly to WSNs due to their constraints of resources.

In IDS many systems uses number of techniques for providing accuracy by selecting complete features of dataset but they lagged in terms of time and memory. For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications.

This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace.
