Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one solution to encounter such problems. But IDSes are unable to reactive efficiently in encrypted accesses with encryption protocols, because they can not check the contents of a packet. This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation. We show that this system is able to detect various attacks with a high accuracy, by implementing our proposed system on the Snort intrusion detection software and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4244-1691-2;9781424416912","978-1-4244-1692-9;9781424416929","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580619","","Access protocols;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","cryptography;feature extraction;network servers;security of data;transport protocols","DARPA evaluation dataset;SSH protocol;Snort intrusion detection software;TCP traffic;database servers;decipher private information;encrypted accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;encryption protocols;http servers, ftp servers;intrusion signatures;network public servers","","4","","18","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in the mobile area there are many security issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed, let alone been solved. Most of the security mechanisms and techniques used in wired networks tend to rely upon a fixed network topology. For example, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are placed at central points of a network and configured with a model of the network's structure to control and analyse the data flows transferred for harmful content. If at all, adopting these measures for the mobile world is not easy due to its dynamically changing environments and the mobile device's resource constraints that do not allow demanding analyse tasks. In this paper, we present our work in progress of developing a system architecture for cooperative and self-protecting mobile devices. Our approach is based on the assumption that a mobile network can be protected by securing all participating devices or at least all honest participating devices. Thus, we no longer insist on a global view of the network but on several local views. To make these views as precise as possible and to avoid serious performance bottlenecks on a single device we propose a strategy for coupling trusted mobile devices together into a cooperating group","","1-4244-0422-3;1424404223","","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198802","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Network topology;Protection;Virtual private networks","mobile computing;mobile handsets;security of data;telecommunication network topology","cooperative self-protecting mobile devices;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;mobile network;network topology;security issues;trustful relationships","","0","","39","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","94","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.","0163-6804;01636804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852093","","Encryption;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Payloads;Telecommunication network management","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","Internet;behavior-based intrusion detection;data exfiltration;encrypted communication;encrypted environments;malicious activity detection","","0","","13","","","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It then raises an alarm whenever any anomalous network behaviors outside the boundaries of its training sets are observed. However, anomaly based IDS are usually prone to high false positive rate due to difficulties involved in defining normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. In this paper, we employ two different statistical methods viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop new anomaly based IDS models. We then evaluate the performance of these IDS models on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set and analyze their performance against other IDS models based on Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the performance (Accuracy and Detection Rate) of both the LDA and the LR based models are at par and in some cases even better than other IDS models. Moreover, unlike the IDS model based on complex method like the SVM, the proposed LDA and LR based IDS models are computationally more efficient, which makes them more suited for deployment in real time network monitoring and intrusion detection analysis.","","978-1-4673-7398-2;9781467373982","","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443533","C4.5;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA);Logistic Regression (LR);NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Data models;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;regression analysis;security of data;support vector machines","C4.5;IDS;LDA;LR;SVM;acceptable behavior recognition;anomalous network behaviors;anomaly based intrusion detection system;benchmark NSL-KDD data set;intrusion detection analysis;intrusion detection systems;linear discriminant analysis;logistic regression;naive Bayes;network traffic patterns;performance evaluation;real time network monitoring;statistical methods;support vector machine","","","","15","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective is to detect the adversary as quickly as possible while satisfying certain detection error constraints. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is constructed to systematically analyze the proposed scheme.

With a multi-channel approach and up to eight redundant RSS readings, the position estimation error can be reduced significantly.

Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naive Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset. It is found that the fuzzy genetic algorithm with the fitness measure based on data mining support-confidence framework performs better compared to other fitness measure but in terms of classification Naive Bayesian technique is much more reliable.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073108","Classification;Fuzzy;Genetic Algorithm;Machine learning;Nave Bayes","Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Niobium;Pragmatics;Sociology;Training","Bayes methods;biology computing;combinatorial mathematics;data mining;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;proteins","Naive Bayesian approach;cellular localization sites;combinatorial optimization problem;data mining support-confidence framework;evolution process;evolutionary fuzzy genetic algorithm;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule based classification system;generalization capability;machine learning problems;multivariate dataset classification;pattern classification;pattern detection;performance analysis;proteins;soft-computing techniques;statistical techniques;yeast","","0","","15","","","22-23 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures.

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2537331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423661","Static-sensor networks;mobile-target detection;optimal deployment","Genetic algorithms;Mobile communication;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking","object detection;sensors","dynamic approach;expanding search areas;mobile-target detection;natural terrain variation;on-line reconfigurability;sensor network deployment;static-sensor network;unstructured search areas","","","","63","","2016-03-02","June1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates.

In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","1","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively.

The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS.

Studies have shown that flow-based anomaly detection mechanisms give promising results as compared to typical signature based attack detection mechanisms which have not been able to detect such attacks effectively. For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based. Analyses has been done for two techniques one belonging to each category. The paper has analyzed and evaluated these with respect to their detection accuracy and capability. Finally, we have suggested improvements that can be helpful to give results better than both the previously proposed algorithms.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","7","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits. The pilot version of the SMARTDIAB has already been implemented, while the platform's evaluation in clinical environment is being in progress.","1089-7771;10897771","","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2039711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401101","Closed-loop glucose control;diabetes management;home care;information and communication technologies;telemedicine","","Internet;decision support systems;diseases;medical information systems;patient care;patient monitoring;patient treatment;telemedicine;wireless LAN","Internet;SMARTDIAB;Web server;Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service;continuous glucose measurement system;decision support system;diabetes data management system;front-end interfaces;health management;insulin infusion advisory system;insulin infusion rate;insulin pump;patient management unit;patient monitoring;patient treatment;patient unit;subcutaneous insulin infusion;type 1 diabetes mellitus patients","Blood Glucose;Cellular Phone;Computer Communication Networks;Data Mining;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Disease Management;Humans;Infusions, Subcutaneous;Insulin Infusion Systems;Medical Informatics Applications;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Nonlinear Dynamics;Spectrum Analysis, Raman;Telemetry;User-Computer Interface","19","2","49","","2010-01-29","May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2339-0;0769523390","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","8","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response.

As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems pose several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. First, these systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally, the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains. In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system targeted to VoIP systems, called SCIDIVE (pronounced Skydive). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including, masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both classes of protocols that compose VoIP systems - call management protocols (CMP), e.g., SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), e.g., RTP. SCIDIVE proposes two abstractions for VoIP IDS - stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection denotes assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross protocol detection denotes matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE is demonstrated on a sample VoIP system that comprises SIP clients and SIP proxy servers with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created and the accuracy and the efficiency of the system evaluated with rules meant to catch these attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9;0769520529","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311913","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;IP networks;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Streaming media;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet telephony;client-server systems;data communication;protocols;security of data","IP networks;SCIDIVE;SIP proxy servers;VoIP systems;billing fraud attacks;call management protocols;cross-protocol detection;data delivery;denial-of-service intrusion;intrusion detection;masquerading intrusion;media delivery protocols;media stream-based attacks;rule-matching engine;stateful detection;voice traffic transmition;voice-over-IP","","29","4","17","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods.

However, CAN bus does not have enough security features to protect itself from inside or outside attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the best ways to enhance the vehicle security level. Unlike the traditional IDS for network security, IDS for vehicle requires light-weight detection algorithm because of the limitations of the computing power of electronic devices reside in cars. In this paper, we propose a light-weight intrusion detection algorithm for in-vehicle network based on the analysis of time intervals of CAN messages. We captured CAN messages from the cars made by a famous manufacturer and performed three kinds of message injection attacks. As a result, we find the time interval is a meaningful feature to detect attacks in the CAN traffic. Also, our intrusion detection system detects all of message injection attacks without making false positive errors.","","","","10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427089","car seucirty;controller area network;intrusion detection system","Intrusion detection;Privacy;Protocols;Safety;Standards;Vehicles","computer network security;controller area networks;on-board communications","CAN bus;CAN messages;ECU;IDS;cars;controller area network bus;electronic control units;electronic devices;in-vehicle network;inside attack;intrusion detection system;message injection attack detection;network security;outside attack;security features;serial communication;time interval analysis;vehicle security level","","","","22","","","13-15 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, the authors propose a novel approach called PRE-Bin that automatically extracts binary-type fields of binary protocols based on fine-grained bits. First, a silhouette coefficient is introduced into the hierarchical clustering to confirm the optimal clustering number of binary frames. Second, a modified multiple sequence alignment algorithm, in which the matching process and back-tracing rules are redesigned, is also proposed to analyse binary field features. Finally, a Bayes decision model is invoked to describe field features and determine bit-oriented field boundaries. The maximum a posteriori criterion is leveraged to complete an optimal protocol format estimation of binary field boundaries. The authors implemented a prototype system of PRE-Bin to infer the specification of binary protocols from actual traffic traces. Experimental results indicate that PRE-Bin effectively extracts binary fields and outperforms the existing algorithms.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452480","","","Bayes methods;reverse engineering","Bayes decision model;automatic binary protocol reverse engineering;back-tracing rules;binary field boundaries;binary field features;binary protocols;binary-type fields;bit-oriented field boundaries;bit-oriented format extraction approach;fine grained bits;optimal clustering number;optimal protocol format estimation;protocol message format extraction;silhouette coefficient;target protocol specifications;text-based protocols","","","","","","","4 14 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems have traditionally been based on the characterization of a user and tracking of activity of the user to see if it matches that characterization. Artificial neural networks provide a feasible approach to model complex engineering systems such as intrusion detection. Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel version of the back propagation training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks that are used for detecting intruders based on the MPI standard on Linux PC clusters. The experiments show a considerable increase in speedup during training and testing of the neural network, which in turn increases the speed of detecting intruders","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635453","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Intrusion detection;Linux;Neural networks;Systems engineering and theory","backpropagation;computer networks;feedforward neural nets;security of data;telecommunication security","Linux PC clusters;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;backpropagation training algorithm;cluster computing;complex engineering systems;feedforward neural networks;multilayered security architecture;network intrusion-detection systems","","0","","29","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The result of such progress leads to an exponential growth in the ability to generate and access to the information. Therefore, there is a need to have both appropriate and specific data. To achieve this goal, data fusion approaches are applied to analyze large scale of heterogeneous data in complex systems. The existing data fusion systems rely generally on human experts but they lack of training dataset for the fusion techniques. Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed. This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria. The general system architecture is presented to allocate the data fusion component within the network.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","2374-0221;23740221","978-1-4244-3337-7;9781424433377","","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","8","6","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252;15502252","978-1-4673-0989-9;9781467309899","978-1-4673-0988-2;9781467309882","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples of those parameters include, but are not limited to time stamp information, attack type, source and destination IP addresses, direction of alert and network application type. In this paper we propose a novel framework for mining alerts of NIDS output report log for automatically predicting the severity of attack revealed by those alerts using data mining classification techniques. Our framework automatically detects the attack severity using the type of the suspicious traffic detected by NIDS as a feature. Hence it can save the time spent to manually analyze the log file of NIDS in order to categorize various types of captured suspicious traffic in view of the detected severity of attack. Moreover, it can help the network security administrator to create policy rules that take immediate action against the detected network attack based on its predicted severity.

In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470964","","","IP networks;ant colony optimisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","ant colony optimisation technique;ant-based DDoS detection technique;ant-based distributed denial-of-service detection technique;bandwidth utilisation wastage;defence system;intruder detection;multilevel IP log table;multilevel secure architecture;pheromone deposit;roaming virtual honeypots;traffic overhead","","","","","","","5 19 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

BEMSs control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems in buildings; more specifically, they control HVAC's primary components such as air handling units (AHUs), chillers, and heating elements. BEMSs are essential components of modern buildings, tasked with seemingly contradicting requirements?minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupants? comfort [1]. In the United States, about 40% of total energy consumption and 70% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings every year. These numbers are comparable to global statistics that about 30% of total energy consumption and 60% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings. Buildings are an integral part of global cyber-physical systems (smart cities) and evolve and interact with their surroundings. As buildings undergo years of exploitation, their thermal characteristics deteriorate, indoor spaces (especially in commercial buildings) get rearranged, and usage patterns change. In time, their inner (and outer) microclimates adjust to changes in surrounding buildings, overshadowing patterns, and city climates, not to mention building retrofitting. Thus, even in cases of ideally designed BEMS/HVAC systems, because of ever-changing and uncertain indoor and outdoor environments, their performance frequently falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, the complexity of BEMSs, large amounts of constantly changing data, and evolving interrelations among sensor feeds make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. Therefore, traditional data-mining algorithms and data-analysis tools are often inadequate.This article provides an overview of issues related to modern BEMSs with a multitude of (often con- licting) requirements. Because of massive and often incomplete data sets, control, sensing, and the evolving nature of these complex systems, computational intelligence (CI) techniques present a natural solution to optimal energy efficiency, energy security, and occupant comfort in buildings. The article further presents an overall architecture where CI can be used in BEMSs and concludes with a case study of the practical applications of using CI techniques in the BEMS domain.","1932-4529;19324529","","","10.1109/MIE.2015.2513749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436878","","Adaptation models;Buildings;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Resilience;Security;Smart grids","building management systems;energy management systems","HVAC system;access control;adaptive buildings;building automation systems;building control systems;building energy management systems;computational intelligence;fire safety;intelligent buildings;life safety;lighting system;physical security","","","","","","","Spring 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
