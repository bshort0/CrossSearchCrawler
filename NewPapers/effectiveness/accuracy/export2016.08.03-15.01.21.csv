Over the past decade several DPI systems have evolved targeting specific issues related to traffic management, user/application policing, intrusion detection/prevention, URL/malicious/unwanted content filtering. Snort, OpenDPI, Bro, L7-filter, ClamAV are a number of open-source tools based on custom DPI engines and custom rule-sets. The surging demand for higher bandwidth DPI systems capable of supporting larger rule-sets requires the use of hardware acceleration and hardware-based systems. In comparison to software based systems, the design and development of custom purpose hardware for DPI is expensive. The need for DPI solutions for a range of applications at high speed requires a unified processing platform. This paper presents the research in converting known DPI rule-sets into a meta format based on regular expressions, that can be executed by software and hardware-based processing platforms. To demonstrate this work a Snort2Regex translator has been developed to transform Snort rules into regular expressions using not only the content of the Snort rule but every relevant element that belongs to it and could increase the accuracy of the analysis.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-61284-232-5;9781612842325","978-1-61284-231-8;9781612842318","10.1109/icc.2011.5963095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963095","","Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Syntactics","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;inspection;public domain software;telecommunication traffic","Bro;ClamAV;Internet traffic inspection;L7-filter;OpenDPI;Snort2Regex translator;URL content filtering;application policing;hardware acceleration;hardware-based processing platform;hardware-based system;high speed network;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;layer-7 content analysis;malicious content filtering;meta format;open-source tools;rule based deep packet inspection;software-based processing platform;traffic management;unwanted content filtering;user policing","","2","","12","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The standard approach for implementing a wireless sniffer is to setup a device in the so-called Promiscuous mode. In this mode, devices are able to acquire all traffic that passes through them, independently from its destination. On a wireless network, this means that it is possible to monitor all the activities inside the device's cover range. Unfortunately, the Promiscuous mode limits the use of the device by prohibiting the association with wireless networks, or in general, sending data. This limitation restricts uses of sniffers on specific scenarios. This paper shows how to remove such limitation by presenting our Laurin Project. Laurin is a wireless sniffer that provides sniffer's capabilities without limiting the device's use. This solution opens the doors to the development of new desktop-oriented applications that take advantage of network monitoring capabilities.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4244-9230-5;9781424492305","978-1-4244-9228-2;9781424492282","10.1109/WD.2010.5657729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657729","IEEE 802.11;Promiscuous mode;RFMON;mac80211;sniffer","Ad hoc networks;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","monitoring;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless networks;IEEE 802.11 wireless sniffers;MAC level;Promiscuous mode;desktop-oriented applications;information acquisition;network traffic monitoring;non-invasive node detection","","0","","23","","","20-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing efficacy of cyber threats continues to highlight the inadequacies of traditional defense mechanism such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection System. The security analyst however focuses on finding the technical deficiency but do not consider the adversaries motivations and their diversity in attacking mechanism. The attackers are not analogous; they differ in their motivations, strategies, devices used and potential. In order to analyze and design security system, it is therefore necessary to consider characteristics that ascertain attack strategy, attacker behavior and threats generated by attackers. The attacker behavioral analysis has proved to be an impulsive aid for threat analysis. A generic model is proposed to model the cyber attacker's behavior more accurately by considering the principles behind the attacker's behavior and thereby generating the profile of an attacker.","","","","10.1109/WCI.2015.7495520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495520","Behavior Analysis;Cyber Attack;Mathematical Model;Profile","Computers;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Operating systems;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the SDN architecture empowers networks to actively monitor traffic and diagnose threats to facilitates network forensics, security policy alteration, and security service insertion. The separation of the control and data planes, however, opens security challenges, such as man-in-the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and saturation attacks. In this paper, we analyze security threats to application, control, and data planes of SDN. The security platforms that secure each of the planes are described followed by various security approaches for network-wide security in SDN.

The circular sequences of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process is replaced by circular body, then, a little data is extracted from normal system call sequences, and is transformed to decisive table, afterward, the decisive table is reduced and the simplest rules that present normal behavior mode is extracted by rough sets theory. These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper. Compared with other methods in the literature, the method presented in this paper is not only able to extract a set of effective detection rules with the minimum size from part of records of system call sequences, but also can detect the known intrusion quickly. Experiments show that this method in this paper is better than other methods.","","978-1-4244-6595-8;9781424465958","978-1-4244-6596-5;9781424465965","10.1109/MVHI.2010.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532641","Anomaly Detection;Decision Condition;Hidden Markov Model;Rough Set Reduction;System Call","Computer interfaces;Computer vision;Data mining;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Machine vision;Man machine systems;Mathematics;Probability distribution;Rough sets","","","","1","","3","","","24-25 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717881","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Security","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;security of data;storage management","IT-Infrastructure;SAL platform;SIEM platform;application logs;central interface;central storage;computing resources;correlation algorithms;correlation tasks;event clustering;event correlation module;high performance security analytics;in-memory data management technique;k-means algorithm;management methods;multicore architecture;next generation security information and event management platform];real-time event information;real-time events;security analytics lab;security event correlation;system logs","","0","","8","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks. In this work, we explore the challenges posed in identifying and developing a set of behavior primitives that facilitate the creation of threat narratives use to describe cyber threats anomalies. Thus, we investigate the use aggregate behaviors derived from network flow data establishing initial behavior models used to detect complex cyber threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Our cyber data fusion prototype employs a unique layered methodology that extracts features from network flow data aggregating it by time. This approach is more scalable and flexible in its application in large network data volumes.

In this paper, we suggest a new method for correlating alerts based on their attributes. We use time windows along with a classification method to distinguish those received alerts that are correlated with the new alert. Time windows are applied for reducing the number of comparisons and improving the accuracy of correlation. Our experiments which were done on DARPA2000 show that while the cost of comparisons dropped noticeably, the correlation method performed accurately. Our method is not limited to known attack scenarios and does not need extra domain knowledge except for training the classifier.","","978-0-7695-3892-1;9780769538921","","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360130","Alert Correlation;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Time Window","Correlation;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection","computer networks;correlation methods;estimation theory;probability;telecommunication security","DARPA2000;alert correlation;classification method;correlation method;correlation probability estimation;intrusion detection system;network security;time windows","","3","","16","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","978-1-4244-5879-0;9781424458790","","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","10","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect such sophisticated scans we propose the integration of algorithmic detection and visualization for human detection to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The proposed approach provides real world detection capabilities without excessive computation overhead.

However, there is no existing solution that considers all aspects such as deployment cost and system efficiency. In this paper, we apply a light-weight watermarking technique to defend against false data injection attacks. To be specific, we add a secure watermark to real-time meter readings and transmit the watermarked data through high speed unsecured network. The utility can then correlate the watermarked data with the original watermark to detect the presence of false data injected by adversary.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature. We further see that the standard classifiers are better able to classify an anomalous message when L is small.","1573-0077;15730077","978-1-4244-9219-0;9781424492190","978-1-4244-9220-6;9781424492206","10.1109/INM.2011.5990708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990708","","Fires;Grammar;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Routing protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","ASCII message representation;Euclidean classifiers;Internet;Levenshtein distance;SIP messages;UDP;anomalous message detection;machine learning algorithms;message encryption;multimedia session establishment protocol;self-learning systems;self-similar session initiation protocol","","3","1","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","35","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distributed defense collaborating with single-point-deployed security applications over multiple network domains are promising. However, most of the reported collaborative schemes for distributed defense are application-specific. There is not much research that studies the general properties of variant collaborative schemes systematically. In this paper explores properties of general collaborative defense strategies from the perspective of complex system. A three-layered network modeling platform has been developed.

However, a high percentage of alerts generated by such systems are liable to be false positives. Since these alerts typically require manual intervention from a network administrator, false positives create considerable administrative overheads. In order to reduce the number of false positives, we propose a new network protection component called a network quarantine channel, which is used to perform some additional interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic. The network quarantine channel is used to provide a more accurate assessment of the threat posed by a suspicious host, before alerting the network administrator","","0-7695-2749-3;0769527493","","10.1109/WI-IATW.2006.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053201","applications.;autonomous auctions and negotiation;autonomous knowledge;autonomy-oriented computing;distributed problem solving;information agents;infrastructure security;intelligent response;intrusion detection","Adaptive filters;Adaptive systems;Deductive databases;Information filtering;Information filters;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Telecommunication traffic","multi-agent systems;security of data","adaptive policies;alert filters;intelligent intrusion detection;network quarantine channels;response system","","0","1","14","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm.

The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack.

The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive attack tree that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks.

The modeling approach on the other hand, can be done in an a-prior manner and is also much less costly. In this paper an architecture for internet voting system based on dependable web services is described as our case study. Dependability attributes are applied to this system as one of the most important specifications of critical systems. On the other hand voting requirements is considered in this architecture. After explaining the architecture it is modeled with RBD and Petri nets. Then these models are evaluated and reliability, availability and system failure is calculated quantitatively.

Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors.

Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles. These technical components take fundamentally different approaches from traditional empirical or statistical methods and are designed based on rigorous computational analysis with mathematically proven performance guarantee.

The behavior based monitoring is used to avoid the polymorphic malicious code. Signature based detection system or fixing these vulnerabilities are not the efficient method. Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user. It introduces an average eight percent computation overhead into the system.","","978-1-4673-2756-5;9781467327565","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450586","Malicious code;Native API;Scrambling","Browsers;Computers;Educational institutions;Kernel;Monitoring;Registers","application program interfaces;security of data","behavior based monitoring;high level system API;kernel mode;local ID;malicious code prevention;polymorphic malicious code;remote ID;security scheme;signature based detection system;system service caller;window system","","0","","11","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940213","Intrusion detection;Service Attacks;Service-oriented vehicular;intrusion detection;networks;service attacks;service-oriented vehicular networks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Road traffic;Service-oriented architecture;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Wireless networks","computer network security;data communication;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","DoS;ELIDV;ITS;NS-3 simulator;VANET;denial of service;efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network;false alert generation;high-rate data communication;integrity target;intelligent transportation system;low false positive rate;malicious detection;road-side units;service-oriented vehicular network;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless network","","2","","23","","2014-10-30","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

However, one of the most significant challenges in this area is the poor detection rate, due to the presence of excessive features in a data set whose class distributions are imbalanced. Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

This paper (1) presents an evaluation method called the true positive cost curve (TPCC), which makes it possible to evaluate and compare HICHPs in an operating environment, but also allows an operator to tune HICHPs within a specific operating environment; (2) presents improvements on the way HICHPs visit Web pages and evaluates them with the TPCC method; and (3) discusses the impact of time bombs on the performance of HICHPs in an operating environment and the ability to tune an HICHP for optimal performance with the help of the TPCC.","2162-2108;21622108","978-0-7695-3668-2;9780769536682","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211044","client honeypot;evaluation;intrusion detection;security","Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Weapons;Web pages;Web server","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;online front-ends;security of data","HICHP;Internet;classification;cost-based evaluation method;dedicated vulnerable Web browser;high-interaction client honeypot;potentially malicious Web page;security device;time bomb;true positive cost curve","","4","","28","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As different kinds of worms spread in the Internet, the interactions among them have strong impact on the propagation of worms. In order to eliminate the negative effect, it is necessary to characterize these interaction behaviors. Accounting for these factors, a model with two mutualistic symbiosis worms is proposed in this paper. The stability of the infection-free equilibrium and positive equilibrium are discussed. Through theoretical analysis, the stability conditions are obtained mathematically. Numerical results from the experiment are in favor of the theoretical analysis. It also indicates that the mutualistic symbiosis worms indeed promote each other's spread in the Internet, which is helpful to design strategies to control the spread of worms.","","978-1-4799-1390-9;9781479913909","","10.1109/MIC.2013.6758077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758077","mutualistic symbiosis worms;numerical simulation;propagation model;stability","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Equations;Grippers;Jacobian matrices;Mathematical model","Internet;invasive software","Internet worm attacks;infection-free equilibrium;mutualistic symbiosis worms;positive equilibrium","","0","","10","","","16-18 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the IANA pool of IPv4 addresses has run out, IPv6 will become increasingly important. Although the IPv6 protocol stack presents considerable advantages compared with the IPv4 protocol stack, IP source address spoofing is still exploited in IPv6 to initiate malicious attacks. Some techniques are proposed and deployed to implement source address validation at fine granularity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of fine granularity IP source address validation, e.g. whether filtering technology is deployed to prevent hosts from using forged IP address. We develop a detection tool with controlled spoofing ability which can infer whether the function of filtering spoofing address packets is enabled. We run this tool in 12 famous universities in China and collect the testing data. We gather a total of 41373 probes from 324 clients, and each probe includes sending at least 5 packets with the same spoofing source address to the control server. Results reveal that, 77.02% of the spoofing probes are completely filtered, 0.29% of the spoofing probes are partly filtered and the rest spoofing probes are not filtered at all. Overall, this illustrates that techniques of source address validation have been widely deployed in campus networks. Our statistical results provide practical basis for the deployment and further development of source address validation protocols in IPv6 networks.","","978-1-4577-1668-3;9781457716683","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077038","IPV6;efficiency;fine granularity;source address validation;spoofing","Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Wireless networks","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","IANA pool;IPv4 addresses;IPv6 protocol;detection tool;fine granularity;malicious attacks;source address validation;spoofing address packet filtering","","1","","20","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PAYL takes into consideration the entire payload for profile calculation and effectively for anomaly detection. Payload length is very high on port numbers like 21 and 80. Hence it is difficult to apply PAYL on high speed, high bandwidth networks. We use CPP (content based payload partitioning) technique which divides the payload into different partitions depending on content of payload. PCNAD does payload based anomaly detection using a few CPP partitions. We demonstrate usefulness of the PCNAD on the 1999 DARPA IDS data set. We observed 97.06% accuracy on port 80 using only 62.64% packet payload length with small false positive rate.

Besides, historical data are not generally used, neither for analysis nor for sequential adaptation of the knowledge representation models used for detection; hence this wealthy information about the essence and the potential trends of the target system is not commonly considered. Thus, by the generalized use of Bayesian belief networks, ESIDE-Depian achieves the main goal of detecting and preventing both well-known and also zero-day attacks with excellent results, by means of unified real-time analysis of network traffic.","1529-4188;15294188","978-0-7695-2932-5;9780769529325","","10.1109/DEXA.2007.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312918","","Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Expert systems;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Power system modeling","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bayesian belief networks;ESIDE-Depian intrusion detection;anomaly detection;evidence propagation;knowledge representation models;misuse detection;network traffic;parametric learning;prevention system","","3","","15","","","3-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a radio frequency communication system that allows for real-time evaluation of changes to established field patterns for the purpose of locating and tracking unwanted intruders. It is based on high confidence probabilistic algorithms and protocols that sample the environment every second. The protocols are implemented in firmware making the system capable of detecting disturbances in real-time. During a field test, system calibration and sensor performance were recorded, mapped, and displayed in a control room. For example, it is possible to simultaneous locate and track single and multiple intruders in a protected area of 100,000 square feet with a single unit. Left behind items and people in hiding are easily detected and all intrusions are verified by an automatically cued camera. The system described here is extremely effective where most fence-based systems fail.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4244-7403-5;9781424474035","","10.1109/CCST.2010.5678669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678669","Camera Cueing;Hidden Object Detection;Long Range;Perimeter Protection;RF;Real-time Intrusion Detection;Volumetric;Wireless","Antennas;Calibration;Cameras;Communication system security;Radio frequency;Security;Wireless communication","alarm systems;cameras;computerised monitoring;firmware;protocols;safety systems","automatically cued camera;firmware making;infrastructure protection;intrusion detection system;multiple intruders;probabilistic algorithms;protocols;radio frequency communication;real time evaluation;sensor systems;wireless perimeter protection","","0","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The method of network intrusion detection based on the neural network GCBP algorithm","Yan Li; Wang Jie","Computer Center, Zhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management, China","Computer Science and Information Processing (CSIP), 2012 International Conference on","20120924","2012","","","1082","1086","In this paper, it presented the method of network intrusion detection based on the neural network GCBP algorithm. By analyzing and comparing the BP algorithm with the GCBP algorithm, what learned is that the GCBP algorithm had overcome the weaknesses, which traditional BP algorithm has of slow convergent speed and easily getting into local minimum. Applicable effects of the method of the intrusion detection are much better, more highly accurate, and greater adaptively. I also showed the ability of more quickly learning. To a great extent, it can achieve the detection of unknown data packets, providing an effective way to efficiently and accurately realize intrusion detection.","","978-1-4673-1410-7;9781467314107","","10.1109/CSIP.2012.6309044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309044","BP neural network;CGBP algorithm;conjugate gradient;intrusion detection","Databases;MATLAB","backpropagation;conjugate gradient methods;neural nets;security of data","network intrusion detection;neural network conjugate gradient back propagation algorithm;unknown data packet detection","","0","","","","","24-26 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
