In this paper, we developed an anomaly-based detection model using a statistical method combined with a binary logistic regression approach. The model, Layer based Anomaly Detection (LbAD) is designed to detect remote to user (R2L) and user to root (U2R) attacks by statistically examining the degree of normal field values within three layer (data link, network, transport) of OSI Seven Layer.

The goal of blacklists is to predict and block future attack sources. Existing blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and, more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as predictive blacklisting) based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models). We evaluate our combined method on one month of logs from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it improves significantly the prediction rate over state-of-the-art methods as well as the robustness against poisoning attacks.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5461982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461982","","Collaboration;Communications Society;History;Internet;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Robustness;Security;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;recommender systems;security of data;time series","Internet;Netflix competition;attacker-victims interactions;implicit recommendation system;malicious traffic;multilevel prediction model;neighborhood models;predictive collaborative blacklisting;prolific attack sources;time series","","6","","20","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits","","1-4244-0996-9;1424409969","1-4244-0997-7;1424409977","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646","","Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency","","0","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The malignant skin tumors much resemble benign nevus, mole or dysplastic naevi. For dermatologists, it is a tedious task to analyze every patient sample more precisely, so it needs a decision support system to analyze the danger associated with a given sample. In this work color images of melanoma are imparted to classify them among malignant and benign classes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized by Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO). As a part of the preprocessing step, an illumination compensation based segmentation algorithm is deployed. The segmentation process is followed by the proposed iterative dilation method to remove noise from a lesion.

Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences. We further introduce a novel indicator which measures the level of confidence in the detection.

It provide advantages such as reporting consolidated data, reducing data redundancy, improving network lifetime etc. However, deploying WSNs in hostile and remote environments presents security vulnerabilities that can lead to various security attacks such as energy based attacks, attacks on data aggregation etc. Numerous secure DA techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5;9781479967605","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber-attack processes exhibit long range dependence and in order to investigate such properties a new class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) can be used. In this paper, GARMA (1,2; ,1) model is fitted to cyber-attack data sets. Three different estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters. The Hannan-Rissanen Algorithm, Whittle Estimation Method and Maximum Likelihood Estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters of the GARMA (1,2;,1). Point forecasts to predict the attack rate possibly hours ahead of time also has been done and the performance of the models and estimation methods are discussed. The investigation of the case-study will confirm that by exploiting the statistical properties, it is possible to predict cyber-attacks (at least in terms of attack rate) with good accuracy. This kind of forecasting capability would provide sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense configurations or resource allocations.","","978-1-4799-7625-6;9781479976256","","10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176399","Communication Systems;Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average;Intrusion forecasting;Long range dependence;Predictive modeling","Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;maximum likelihood estimation;resource allocation;security of data;time series","ARMA models;GARMA models;Hannan-Rissanen algorithm;Whittle estimation method;communication systems;cyber defense system;cyber-attack processes;generalized autoregressive moving average;intrusion detection systems;maximum likelihood estimation methods;parameter estimation;predictive modeling;resource allocation;time series modeling","","0","","17","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system.

Test results for the NSL-KDD dataset prove the proposed approach can outperform the standard classifier in terms of attack detection rate and false alarm rate, while reducing the number of features in the dataset.","","","","10.1109/CyberSA.2015.7166116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166116","Binary Bat Algorithm;Dendritic Cell Algorithm;IDS;SVM","Feature extraction;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Particle swarm optimization;Silicon;Support vector machines","artificial immune systems;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","NSL-KDD dataset;SVM classifier;anomaly based IDS model;artificial immune system;asset availability;asset confidentiality;asset integrity;attack detection rate;cyber threats;false alarm rate;immune intelligent approach;information security assurance;intrusion detection system;security threats mitigation;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","20","","","8-9 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To validate these claims, a classification algorithm is defined under this feature space. We use a subset in KDD Cup 1999 data in the experiments. The KDD Cup 1999 training dataset contains 6 different types of DDoS attacks and the testing dataset contains more 4 novel DDoS attacks. In detecting these 6 already known DDoS attacks and 4 novel DDoS attacks from the normal, we get a high detection rate under this feature space by using the proposed classification algorithm, which shows the discriminative abilities of the feature space.","","0-7803-8403-2;0780384032","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384578","","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer vision;Frequency;Intrusion detection;PROM;Performance analysis;Space exploration;Throughput","computer networks;covariance matrices;security of data;telecommunication security","KDD Cup training dataset;classification algorithm;covariance matrices;distributed denial of service attack identification;distributed denial of service detection;feature space modeling","","1","","16","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, a quantitative and metrics based evaluation of IDSs is desired. We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","15","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed.

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 W output power to the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the PV harvesting system achieved both ultra-low power operation capability at 12 W and a peak self-sustaining efficiency of 86%.","0018-9200;00189200","","","10.1109/JSSC.2015.2418712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091040","Capacitor value modulation;Internet of things;MPPT;energy harvesting;photovoltaic;power management","Capacitors;Charge pumps;Energy harvesting;Hysteresis;Sensors;Switches;Time-domain analysis","Internet of Things;energy harvesting;hysteresis;maximum power point trackers;power consumption;power engineering computing;radio transmitters;solar cells;time-domain analysis","CVM scheme;IOT Smart Nodes;Internet Of Things network;PV cell;capacitor value modulation scheme;circuit level technique;hill-climbing MPPT mechanism;hysteresis controller;hysteresis regulation;power budget;power consumption;power hungry analog circuit;self-sustaining PV energy harvesting system;self-sustaining photovoltaic energy harvesting system;self-triggered one-shot mechanism;signal processor;time-domain MPPT;ultra-low power operation;wireless transmitter","","3","","29","","2015-04-21","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss developing a comprehensive trust management framework to support the establishment and evolution of trust among different cloud service providers.","","978-1-4673-0683-6;9781467306836","978-1-936968-32-9;9781936968329","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144819","Cloud computing;collaborative IDPS;distributed IDPS;intrusion detection","Computational modeling;Indium tin oxide;Load modeling;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;security of data","architectural levels;cloud computing environments;cloud service providers;distributed collaborative and data-driven intrusion detection;global layer;host layer;infrastructure level;intrusion detection and prevention systems;logical layers;network layer;platform levels;security mechanisms;software levels","","2","","28","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is adopted distributed architecture. In order to reduce the relativity of each detection components as far as possible and avoid the simple failure point caused by the single central analyzer, the model is adopted the non-control center multi-SoftMan architecture, which is making enough use of SM attributes, such as independence, activity, self-learning, self-adaptation, self-evolution and society.

Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative. Based on these values the Accuracy and error rate of each classifier is computed.","","978-1-4799-5521-3;9781479955213","","10.1109/ICCICT.2015.7045674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045674","Feature selection;Hidden Nave Bayes;NBTree;Nave Bayes;classification;discretization","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Training","data mining;decision trees;feature selection;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","NBTree classifiers;NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes method conditional independence assumption;data dimensionality;data mining approach;data mining model;data preprocessing activities;decision tree classifiers;dimension reduction;feature discretization;feature selection algorithm;hidden Naive Bayes classifiers;machine learning algorithms;record class label identification","","0","","20","","","15-17 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. AODV, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980;11106980","978-1-4244-4214-0;9781424442140","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

To couple the network with real world tightly, we provide a network-wide time synchronization through the introduction of abstractions for cluster and hierarchy. Generally the error of time synchronization has the tendency of being accumulated as the hop count along the synchronization path increases in multi-hop wireless sensor network. Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path. We then apply different optimal synchronization mechanisms to the cluster heads and cluster members for the sake of power efficiency through an explicit broadcast manner.

In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations.

In Deauth-DoS attack an attacker sends a large number of spoofed de-authentication frames to the client (s) resulting in their disconnection. Existing solutions to mitigate Deauth-DoS attack rely on encryption, protocol modifications, 802.11 standard up gradation, software and hardware upgrades which are costly. In this paper we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the Deauth-DoS attack in Wi-Fi network which does not suffer from these drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge ML based techniques have never been used for detection of Deauth-DoS attack. We have used a variety of ML based classifiers for detection of Deauth-DoS attack enabling an administrator to choose among a host of classification algorithms.

In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast.

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load hot-spot, which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","978-1-4244-2066-7;9781424420667","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If that is true, we may be able to tease out the differences in the underlying structure of attackers and normal activity. Our research investigates unsupervised clustering techniques for network intrusion detection. The data comes from our most readily available source, the University of Virginia's network traffic. Our approach collapses all of the network communication between a host-source pair into a single descriptive data point, or netflow. The extracted features are then clustered to determine the different access patterns and separate types of communications. Features extracted from the netflow will be used to devise features that summarize all the network activity of an IP node. This aggregated IP level information is then used to cluster the IPs, which should enable us to differentiate between user groups. When a node's behavior changes by switching its associated cluster or it differs substantially from other similar nodes it may reveal a compromise. This approach should allow us to identify outliers that differ significantly from typical traffic of its corresponding cluster.","","","","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489302","Anomaly Detection;Cyber Security;Network Intrusion Detection;Unsupervised Clustering","Aggregates;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols","IP networks;feature extraction;pattern classification;security of data","IP level information;IP node;University of Virginia network traffic;attacker access pattern;dynamic detection methods;host-source pair;network activity;network intrusion detection;single descriptive data point;unsupervised clustering techniques","","","","9","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","22","","33","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","1071-9458;10719458","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","5","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the appropriate distance measures of this kind is constrained edit distance, but the time complexity of its computation is too high. We propose a two-phase indexless search procedure for application in misuse detection-based IDS that makes use of q-gram distance instead of the constrained edit distance. We study how well q-gram distance approximates edit distance with special constraints needed in IDS applications. We compare the performances of the search procedure with the two distances applied in it. Experimental results show that the procedure with the q-gram distance implemented achieves for higher values of q almost the same accuracy as the one with the constrained edit distance implemented, but the efficiency of the procedure that implements the q-gram distance is much better.","","978-0-7695-3324-7;9780769533247","","10.1109/IAS.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627086","Edit distance;Intrusion detection;Misuse detection;Search;q-gram distance","Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Indexing;Information security;Intrusion detection;Testing","database management systems;program testing;security of data;software fault tolerance","attack signatures attack signatures;fault-tolerant distance measures;intrusion detection systems;misuse detection;q-gram distance;time complexity;two-phase indexless search procedure","","0","","7","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet.

Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

Traditional port-based technique has become much less effective since many new applications no longer use well-known port numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel profile-based approach to identify traffic flows belonging to the target application. In contrast to classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows in previous studies, we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns of the application. Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on campus traffic traces. Our results show that one can identify the popular P2P applications with very high accuracy.","1548-615X;1548615X","978-1-4244-2084-1;9781424420841","","10.1109/IWQOS.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4539687","","Access control;Application software;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;Data mining;Pattern matching;Payloads;Quality of service;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","P2P applications;network behavioral profiles;traffic flow;two-level matching","","3","2","19","","","2-4 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Adaptive Growing Hierarchical Self Organizing Map for Network Intrusion Detection","D. Ippoliti; X. Zhou","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO, USA","Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN), 2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on","20100902","2010","","","1","7","The growing hierarchical self organizing map (GHSOM) has been shown to be an effective technique to facilitate anomaly detection. However, existing approaches based on GHSOM are not able to adapt online to the ever-changing problem domain of network intrusion. This results in low accuracy in identifying network intrusions, particularly unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GHSOM based approach (A-GHSOM) to network intrusion detection. It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying unknown attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates. It achieves an overall accuracy rate of 99.63%, and 94.04% accuracy rate in identifying unknown attacks while the false positive rate is 1.8%.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-7114-0;9781424471140","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560165","","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Quantization;Training","computer network security;security of data;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication computing","A-GHSOM;adaptive growing hierarchical self organizing map;anomaly detection;dynamic input normalization;feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation;network intrusion detection;prediction confidence filtering;threshold-based training","","5","","17","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If care is not taken and if this network threats are not detected and mitigated on time, this will result into the serious network damage and data loss. Every organization should give priority for Finding and avoiding rogue wireless access points. For detection of unauthorized AP', we have use clock skew as a parameter of a wireless access point (AP). For detecting Rogue access point using clock skews method in wireless LAN network overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. For calculating clock skew of AP, we have use IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We mainly focus on implementation of least-square fit method for this purpose though we have explain both approach for detecting clock skew From this studies we came to known that use of clock skews appears to be an effective and robust method for detecting fake AP's in wireless local area networks.","","978-93-80544-10-6;9789380544106","","10.1109/IndiaCom.2014.6828057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828057","AP;Beacon Frame;Clock skews;MAC address;RAP;Time Synchronization Function (TSF);WLAN","Clocks;Communication system security;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Synchronization;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;least squares approximations;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 time synchronization function time stamp;RAP;TSF time stamp;authorization;beacon/probe response frame;clock skew detection;clock skews method;data loss;illegal access point detection;least-square fit method;network damage;network threat;rogue access point;rogue wireless access point;rough access point;secure network;security threat;system administrator wireless networks;unauthorized AP;wireless LAN network;wireless local area network","","0","","20","","","5-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these applications are required often to be deployed in hostile environments, where nodes and communication are attractive targets to attackers. This makes WSNs vulnerable to a variety of potential attacks. Due to their characteristics, conventional security mechanisms are not applicable. In this context, we propose an intrusion detection framework for a cluster-based WSN (CWSN) that aims to combine the advantage of anomaly and signature detection which are high detection rate and low false positive, respectively.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4673-2712-1;9781467327121","978-1-4673-2711-4;9781467327114","10.1109/ISCC.2012.6249409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6249409","Anomaly detection;Clustering;Intrusion detection system;Signature detection;Wireless sensor network","","","","","1","","13","","","1-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
