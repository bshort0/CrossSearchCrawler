At each time, only M (1  M  K) processes can be observed, and the observations from each chosen process follow two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters. We show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the total expected cost as the error constraints approach zero.

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","21","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A proactive security defense such as intrusion detection system has become a recent research topic in this area. Many intrusion detection models are proposed by the researchers and most of them are promising. How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage. We use a sample case study of disaster recovery operations system to have a real scenario of mobile ad-hoc practice. An experiment is conducted using that scenario under different treatments.

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes.

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.

These devices are widely used to manage critical infrastructure such energy, aviation, mining, banking and transportation. The strategic value of the data and the information transmitted over the Internet infrastructure has a very high economic value. With the increasing value of the data and the information, the higher the threats and attacks on such data and information. Statistical data shows a significant increase in threats to cyber security. The Government is aware of the threats to cyber security and respond to cyber security system that can perform early detection of threats and attacks the internet. The success of a nation's cyber security system depends on the extent to which it is able to produce independently their cyber defense system. Independence is manifested in the form of the ability to process, analyze and create an action to prevent threats or attacks originating from within and outside the country. One of the systems can be developed independently is Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which is very useful for early detection of cyber threats and attacks. The advantages of an IDS is determined by its ability to detect cyber attacks with little false. This study learn how to implement a combination of various methods of machine-learning to the IDS to improve the accuracy in detecting attacks. This study is expected to produce a prototype IDS. This prototype IDS, will be equipped with a combination of machine-learning methods to improve the accuracy in detecting various attacks. The addition of machine-learning feature is expected to identify the specific characteristics of the attacks occurred in the Indonesian Internet network.

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system.

Proceedings of the 12th IEEE International Conference on","20041101","2004","","","218","227","An attack-resistant network is a purpose-built network to survive attacks; by construction, it should be both resilient and secure. Resiliency is the ability to provide alternative communication paths should one path become disrupted due to failures or attacks; while security is the ability to contain and limit the impact of compromises. Interestingly, these two can present conflicting demands. We provide a first formulation of a new class of problems focusing on the engineering of attack-resistant networks. Our model considers both resiliency and security, and uses a notion of blocking probability as a rigorous measure for evaluating different network constructions.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3;9781424484843","978-0-7695-4159-4;9780769541594","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","4","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior.

As cloud based computing becomes more ubiquitous, commercial building occupants are utilizing cloud based solutions for managing work schedules. Consequently, the opportunity exists to exploit these whole building occupant schedules to infer occupancy levels throughout the building. In addition, when combined with data from directional passive infrared sensors, and a knowledge of the number of mobile users on Wi-Fi access points, the occupancy profiles can be adjusted based on actively sensed occupancy.

This paper proposes a cost reduction method for the MCMC approach by taking moves, i.e., birth and death, out of the iteration loop of the Markov chain when different moving objects interact. For stable and robust tracking, an ellipse model with stochastic model parameters is used. Moreover, our HMM method integrates several different modules in order to cope with multiple discontinuous trajectories.

Computing these metrics using a sample of the trace could potentially save precious time. In this paper, we examine several sampling methods to discover their effects on measurement of the privacy-utility tradeoff when anonymizing network traces. We tested the relative accuracy of several packet and flow-sampling methods on existing privacy and utility metrics. We concluded that, for our test trace, no single sampling method we examined allowed us to accurately measure the tradeoff, and that some sampling methods can produce grossly inaccurate estimates of those values.

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study is another attempt, using rough set theory (RST), a rule based decision making approach to extract rules for intrusion attacks classification. Experiments were performed on publicly available data to explore the performance of four different algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm, covering algorithm, LEM2 and Exhaustive algorithms. It is observed that RST classification based on genetic algorithm for rules generation yields best performance as compared to other mentioned rules generation algorithms.

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7;0769522947","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2906-4;9781467329064","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310","Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine","","Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity","","9","","23","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7;9781479981717","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9;9781467300889","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different solutions have been proposed to optimize Live video streaming (e.g., Multicast) and to optimize VOD streaming (e.g., Cache). Implementation of these solutions at an Internet service provider (ISP) network or at Content Data Network (CDN) can use on-line classification capability of video streaming flows (or sources) into Live streaming type and VOD streaming type to allow proper optimization. Since all streaming applications use the same streaming protocols, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies are practically useless in classifying such applications. In this paper we formulate the problem of on-line video-streaming flow classification. Then, we propose and evaluate two statistical on-line streaming flow classifiers. These classifiers are based on the statistical characterization of the flow packets length. Afterward, we study a slightly different video streaming classification problem, in which we can assume that there are at least X concurrent flows from the same video source, X>1. We propose and evaluate an on-line classifier that decides whether these X flows are Live or VOD. This classifier is based on a simple observation that live streaming flows from the same source transfer the same information almost at the same time, while VOD flows from the same source have larger information offset. The classifiers performance evaluation is based on real traffic dataset. Our single flow best classifier tags 96% of the streams correctly, while our multi-flow classifier successfully tags 96.53% of streams for X=2. We also demonstrate a more complex multi-streaming comparing function that improves the success rate of our algorithm to 97.53% for X>2, but it clearly decreases the algorithm scalability. Finally, additional contribution of this paper includes statistical cha- acterization of live video streaming traffic vs. VOD streaming traffic.","","978-1-5090-1848-2;9781509018482","","10.1109/NCA.2015.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371733","On-line application classification;Statistic application classification;Streaming applications","Classification algorithms;Downlink;IP networks;Internet;Performance evaluation;Streaming media;Uplink","Internet;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication traffic;video on demand;video streaming","CDN;DPI technologies;ISP network;Internet service provider network;VOD streaming;content data network;deep packet inspection technologies;live streaming;on-line flow classification;streaming protocols;time-varying bandwidth;video streaming","","","","11","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate). We evaluate our approach in terms of performance (live detection) and accuracy based on a data set from our partner, Creos Luxembourg S.A., the electricity grid operator in Luxembourg.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436414","","Context;Monitoring;Network topology;Smart grids;Smart meters;Topology","energy consumption;smart power grids","Creos Luxembourg S.A;advanced software monitoring;alerting system;automated device control;automated meter reading;communication technology;context-dependent consumption;electricity grid;energy consumption;information technology;live machine learning;smart grid;suspicious consumption value detection;suspicious electric consumption detection;two-way communication","","","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories. This cascaded classifier approach increases the detection rates of both rare network attack categories and also it increase overall detection rate of an IDS model. The higher detection rates are due to the mitigation of the influence from the dominant categories if the rare attack categories are separated from the dataset.","","978-1-4673-1599-9;9781467315999","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206789","Adaboost;Bayesian Network;detection rate;dominant attacks;rare attacks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost;Bayesian Network Classifier;R2L attacks;U2R attacks;cascaded classifier approach;increase detection rate;network intrusion detection;rare network attack categories;unequal distributed attack","","0","","13","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a single point of failure . We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%.

These misbehaviors can be defined by monitoring features belonging to different Android levels. In this paper we present MADAM, a novel host-based malware detection system for Android devices which simultaneously analyzes and correlates features at four levels: kernel, application, user and package, to detect and stop malicious behaviors. MADAM has been designed to take into account those behaviors characteristics of almost every real malware which can be found in the wild. MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4799-3629-8;9781479936298","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","2","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
