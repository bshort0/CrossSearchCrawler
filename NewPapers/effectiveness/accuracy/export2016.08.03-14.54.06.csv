Monitoring tools based on pattern recognition or behavioral analysis is typically used to ensure network security. SNORT is one such tool which is based on pattern recognition. SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators. This paper proposes a tool which should lessen this burden and considerably reduce the workload of having to classify alerts by human beings.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772652","False Alerts;IDS;JRip;Networks;Neuro-Fuzzy;Security","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection","fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","JRip;NEFCLASS;SNORT alerts;behavioral analysis;false alerts;intrusion detection systems;network security;neuro-fuzzy techniques;pattern recognition","","1","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

In this paper, a hierarchical classifier combiner is proposed to detect network intrusions based on the fusion of multiple well-known and efficient classifiers. The KDDCUP99 dataset is used to train and test the classifiers. The overall performance in terms of the overall error rate, average cost and the false alarm rate is investigated and discussed.

Digital forensic analysis of intrusions using alerts generated by existing intrusion detection system (IDS) faces major challenges, especially for IDS deployed in large networks. In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

The problem of between-class imbalance is a challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry, because of its critical influence on the performance of learning systems. Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

We then introduced the implementation of game-theoretic analysis on an Avionics Sensor-based Defense System (ASDS), which consists of distributed passive and active network sensors. A trade-off between defense and attack strategy was studied via existing tools for game theory (Gambit).

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model.

However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","1","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To guarantee the control system performance when suffering from deception attacks, the RNPC method based on round-trip time delays is proposed to compensate for the adverse effects introduced by the deception attacks as well as the network communication constraints, such as time-varying network delay, packet disorder and packet dropout.

However, it is a challenging task due to the fact that a huge amount of data might be generated for being analyzed in very short time. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying complex analytics and modern in-memory database technology on the large amount of log data. Logs from different kinds of devices are collected, normalized, and stored in the In-Memory database. Machine learning approaches are then implemented to analyze the centralized big data to identify attacks and anomalies which are not easy to be detected from the individual log event.

This research explores the modification of the smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. Using the results from a previous study of optimized static polling rates to create minimum and maximum thresholds, a dynamic polling rate algorithm was devised. This algorithm allowed the smart battery to gauge the network's illicit attack density and adjust its polling rate to efficiently detect attacks, while conserving battery charge life.

To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence.

The limitation of information sources may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Agent Based Peer-to-Peer Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework. Agents are included in this framework to achieve intrusion detections. In addition, a mobile agent migration strategy is applied in the framework to allow agents not only to collect information from direct-linked neighbours but also other hosts in the network.

The most fundamental parameter, POD, is normally related to a number of factors such as the event of interest, the sensitivity of the sensor, the installation quality of the system and the reliability of the sensing equipment. A critical performance parameter of any outdoor perimeter intrusion detection system is its capability of discriminating between intrusion and nuisance events without compromising its sensitivity or POD.

One of the major challenge in Web applications is that it need to process massive files and data-sets to respond to an increasing number of users requests. These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7;9781467306737","978-1-4673-0672-0;9781467306720","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Adaptive context-aware packet filter scheme using statistic-based blacklist generation in network intrusion detection","Y. Meng; L. f.

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains. Moreover, our scheme will adapt and update the blacklist contents by using the method of statistic-based blacklist generation according to the actual network environment. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme and showed the first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.","","978-1-4577-2154-0;9781457721540","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122798","blacklist;intrusion detection;network packet filter","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Table lookup","IP networks;security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","CPU occupancy rate;IP domains;adaptive context-aware packet filter scheme;false alarm rate;signature-based network intrusion detection system;statistic-based blacklist generation;string matching","","1","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9;9781467345279","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, PCA is performed in a centralized manner, which has poor scalability for large distributed systems, on account of the large network bandwidth cost required to gather the distributed state at a fusion center. Consequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA algorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without losing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first contribution lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection in an agent-based architecture by using honeypot network as the closer level of investigation. The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed.

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48. However, accuracy for this hybrid technique is slightly lower compared to others.","","978-1-4577-2154-0;9781457721540","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122808","Intrusion detection system;accuracy;artificial immune recognition system;false alarm rate;rough set theory","Accuracy;Data mining;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","artificial immune systems;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;rough set theory","AIRS1 algorithm;AIS;DOS attack;IT department;J48 algorithm;NSL-KDD;Rough-AIRS 1;artificial immune recognition system;artificial immune system;denial of service attack;false alarm rate;flood attack;incremental learning approach;intrusion detection system;memory storage;redundant feature;rough set theory;security threat;software bug","","0","","15","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differences in pixel intensity are calculated and compared with a fuzzy rule base to calculate edginess. This edginess measure is used to decide whether a pixel belongs to an edge or not. Features extracted from training videos train the Naive Bayesian Classifier which is then used for testing videos. Features are pre-processed using techniques such as Discretize, Fuzzy Logic, Numeric to Binary, PKI Discretize and Normalize. Then, they are filtered using Correlation Feature Selection before training the classifier.

Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture.

What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify subsets of samples and subsets of features that jointly specify anomalous clusters. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect botnet and peer-to-peer flow clusters.

Distribution of video and of live contents also experienced the P2P mechanisms with success. PPLive, UUSee and others have many of customers, hundreds of channels and thousands of concurrent users. However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks. The design of the system and the evaluation of a prototype showed good results and let us be optimistic about a possible deployment of P2P systems for video delivery, having the support of content providers as well as network operators.","","978-1-4244-6728-0;9781424467280","","10.1109/ICIW.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476763","P2P Video Streaming;legal contents;network-awareness;secure distribution;watermarking","Computer architecture;Design optimization;IP networks;Law;Legal factors;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Video sharing;Watermarking;Web and internet services","computer network security;content management;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;video streaming","P2P VoD system;P2P video system;content distribution;file sharing;network operator;peer-to-peer network;video delivery","","1","","20","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently. Moreover, constructed connections are very adequate for training and evaluating IDS models.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750267","data aggregation;intrusion detection;performance monitoring;real-time systems","Correlation;Cryptography;Measurement;Receivers;Silicon","data handling;security of data","DARPA dump data flow;IDS;data stream handling;dynamic window size;heterogeneous data stream;intrusion detection systems;massive data flow conversion;network security;nonstationary data stream;queuing concept;simulated network;time slot windows;university campus","","0","","33","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern DoS attacks that blend normal and malicious network traffic, significantly increase the rate of false alarms, hence challenge the effectiveness of IDS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect such attacks, we propose a semantic analysis framework that integrates network intrusion detection systems (IDSes) with a power flow analysis capable of estimating the execution consequences of control commands. To balance detection accuracy and latency, the parameters of the power flow analysis algorithm are dynamically adapted according to real-time system dynamics. Our experiments on IEEE 24-bus, 30-bus, and 39-bus systems and a 2736-bus system demonstrate that (1) by opening 3 transmission lines, an attacker can put the tested system into an insecure state, and (2) the semantic analysis can complete detection in 200 milliseconds for the large-scale 2736-bus system with about 0.78% false positives and 0.01% false negatives, which allow for timely responses to intrusions.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2547742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442543","Bro;SCADA;adaptive power flow analysis;intrusion detection system;semantic analysis","Generators;Load flow analysis;Mathematical model;Power grids;SCADA systems;Semantics","","","","","","","","2016-03-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To detect or measure emergence we observe the system and extract characteristic attributes from those observations. As an extension of earlier work in the field, we propose emergence measures that are well-suited for continuous attributes (or hybrid attribute sets) using either non-parametric or model-based probability density estimation techniques. We also replace the known entropy-based emergence measures by divergence measures for probability densities (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hellinger distance).

Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.

The IP protocol specifies no method for validating the authenticity of the packet's source. This implies that an attacker can forge the source address to be any desired. This is almost exclusively done for malicious or at least inappropriate purposes. Given that attackers can exploit this weakness for many attacks, it would be beneficial to know if network traffic has spoofed source addresses. This knowledge can be particularly useful as an adjunct to reduce false positive from intrusion detection systems.

SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu. We find 27 previously unknown SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in Ubuntu applications, most of which are also distributed with other Linux distributions.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163045","","Accuracy;Libraries;Protocols;Security;Servers;Software;Testing","Linux;application program interfaces;formal verification;program diagnostics;protocols;security of data","API design;Linux distributions;SSL usage vetting;SSL-TLS protocols;SSLINT;Ubuntu;application program interfaces;automatic logic verification;code quality;logic correctness;network attacks;secure sockets layer;static analysis system;transport layer security","","0","","52","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
