In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic. We also extend the V-HashMem architecture to include a header-ID field and support header matching information, a feature missing both from our own earlier work and many related systems.","1946-147X;1946147X","1-4244-0312-X;142440312X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101006","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","CRC functions;FPGA;Snort-like intrusion detection;comparators;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;single memory structure;variable-length Hashmem architecture","","3","","16","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach based on extension matrix and genetic algorithm to network misuse detection.

Second, a lack of comprehensive labeled Synchrophasor data along with other system related information imposes challenges to the development and evaluation of data mining algorithms that can classify power system cyberpower events. In this work, a WAMS cyber-physical test bed was developed using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Commercial control and monitoring devices, hardware, software, and industry standard communication networks and protocols were combined with custom Matlab, Python, and AutoIt scripts to model realistic power system contingencies and cyber-attacks. An automated simulation and control engine was developed to randomize modeled cyber-power events including power system faults, contingencies, control actions and cyber-attacks. Scripts were added to capture heterogenous sensor data and create ground truth labeled datasets. The WAMS cyber-physical test bed is capable of simulating various sized power systems and creating datasets without altering the hardware configuration. A WAMS architecture is presented to document the integration of various components.

Understanding how and why spoofing attacks are used, combined with a few simple prevention methods, can help protect your network from these malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. The rapid improvements of intrusions in internet and other networks are the main factors responsible for the propagation of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing environment. Now a days the Ids makes use of the signature based detection approach which detects the actions based on analyzing the patterns such as text, password, time etc. So this will create difficulties in updating information and detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we make use of an improved EADS (Exception Agent Detection System) for making the header information secure. Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. In this paper, we also propose an inter-domain packet_filter (IDPF) architecture that can mitigate the level of IP spoofing on the Interne together with the IDS. We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses. In this paper we propose an improved behavioral method for combating the unknown threats other tha- the usual context and content scanning techniques.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738791","Exception agent system;IP spoofing;Intrusion detection system;Local area network;packet filter","Computer architecture;Computer science;Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;Internet;digital signatures;security of data","IP spoofing attack;Internet;TCP/IP network;content scanning techniques;cracking techniques;exception agent detection system;interdomain packet filter architecture;intrusion detection system;malicious cloaking;packet filtering;signature based detection","","1","","12","","","27-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7;9781424409747","978-1-4244-0975-4;9781424409754","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data. Our extensive evaluation shows that, compared with pure statistical learning models, LEAPS achieves consistently higher accuracy when detecting real-world camouflaged attacks with benign program cover-up.","1530-0889;15300889","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266838","Attack Detection;Program Analysis;Statistical Learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Libraries;Payloads;Statistical learning;Training","flow graphs;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;security of data;statistical analysis","LEAPS;attack detection system;camouflaged attack detection;cyberinfrastructures;formal program analysis;malicious system events;statistical learning methods;supervised statistical learning methods;testing data","","","","39","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Functionality of Buildings Energy Management Systems (BEMS) need re-evaluation in the context of smart grid environment. In particular, their inability for real time feedback and a rather static mode of operations requires attention in the light of smart grid operations. By using a multi agent system in combination with traditional BEMS, a layered process control system at building level that conceptualises energy demand interactively with the smart grid supply infrastructure and the environment is possible. Practical contribution is improved energy management by balancing energy demand and energy supply. The paper discusses optimisation of BEMS operations for energy efficiency and indoor human comfort using multi-agents system (MAS) technology in the Smart Grid environment. A conceptual framework for improving the effectiveness BEMS in the realm of smart grids operation and distributed generation using MAS is presented .","","978-1-4799-2791-3;9781479927913","","10.1109/ISDEA.2013.534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843511","Ball Vector Machine;Detection Accuracy;Electric Power Information Network;Intrusion Detection System;Particle Swarm Optimization;Time-consuming","Buildings;Electricity;Energy efficiency;Process control;Real-time systems;Smart grids","building management systems;distributed power generation;energy management systems;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;power generation control;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","BEMS operation optimisation;MAS technology;building energy management system functionality;building level;comfort demand;distributed generation;energy demand;energy efficiency;energy reduction;energy supply;improved energy management;indoor human comfort;layered process control system;multiagent system;real time feedback;renewable energy sources;smart grid environment;smart grid operation;smart grid supply infrastructure;static operation mode","","0","","31","","","6-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have examined the feasibility of our algorithm by conducting several experiments on flow datasets which were categorized as WWW, MAIL, P2P, etc. The experimental results show that classifier with our approach can greatly improve computational performance without negative impact on classification accuracy.

Significant work has been done in error detection achieved through external fault tolerance systems. However, the high data rate coupled with complex detection can cause the capacity of the fault tolerance system to be exhausted resulting in low detection accuracy. We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857;10609857","0-7695-2995-X;076952995X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study.

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

The failure of projects is now being owed to customer not having the correct vision & strategy for the developed software product.

"Towards a Cellular Automata Based Network Intrusion Detection System with Power Level Metric in Wireless Adhoc Networks (IDFADNWCA)","P. K. Sree; I. R. Babu","","2008 International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering","20090106","2008","","","1071","1075","Adhoc wireless network with their changing topology and distributed nature are more prone to intruders. The efficiency of an Intrusion detection system in the case of an adhoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection. The advantage of this approach entails is the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes for reestablishing network monitors.","2154-7491;21547491","978-0-7695-3489-3;9780769534893","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737122","Adhoc Networks;Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms","Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system protection;Watches;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cellular automata;monitoring;telecommunication security","IDFADNWCA algorithm;cellular automata;distributed agent based intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;iterative power optimal solution;network-monitoring node;power level metric;wireless adhoc network","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated response component built upon such systems therefore must consider the imperfect picture inferred from them and take actions accordingly. This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states. The objective is to move the system towards more secure states with respect to particular security metrics.

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1499-7;1424414997","1-4244-1500-4;1424415004","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0;9781424446780","978-0-7695-3760-3;9780769537603","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","4","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to previous tools, ours does not require additional resources, machines, or require additional protocols beyond TCP. The only requirements are that one end host have an open port and be running a modern Linux kernel and that the other end host responds to unsolicited SYN-ACK packets with a RST packet. We evaluate our technique in the wild and compare our off-path estimates to on-path measurements. Our experiments show that our technique provides accurate, real-time estimates of off-path network latency. In over 80% of measurements our technique provides off-path round trip time measurements within 20% of the actual round trip time.

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead. Therefore, we propose a utility based QoE monitoring approach based on statistical losses at the application layer.

Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model.

The detection methods existed are not only complex and impractical, but also unable to extract more information about the abnormal signal. In this paper, we propose a lightweight detection approach for the unauthorized reading without affecting the operation of RFID systems. Such an approach contains three parts: RF signal scanner, signalevent model construction and abnormal feature extraction. In particular, we design and implement a RF scanner to acquire RF signals and measure RSSI values. After that, we build a signal-event model to analyze how the RSSI value is related to the RFID event. The detection of unauthorized reading is to investigate the deviation of observed RSSI values from their expected values. Finally, we extract and separate abnormal RSSI values to estimate the risk of unauthorized reading. The primary experimental results show that our approach can achieve high prediction accuracy in detecting unauthorized reading and make better performance in extracting abnormal features.","","","","10.1109/CSCloud.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371501","abnormal features;scanner;signal-event model;unauthorized reading","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Training","RSSI;feature extraction;radiofrequency identification","RF signal scanner;RFID tag;RFID unauthorized reading;RSSI value;feature extraction;lightweight detection approach;radiofrequency identification;signal event model construction","","","","22","","","3-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In terms of information security, incrementing the intrusion detection rate on anomaly attacks and decreasing the high false positive rate has been the two major concerns for every sysadmin. The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence.

"Health Informatics - Point-Of-Care Medical Device Communication - Technical Report - Guidelines for the Use of RF Wireless Technology","","","IEEE Unapproved Draft Std P11073-00101/D03, Sep 2007","20080509","2008","","","","","The following Guidance document addresses the use of radio frequency 1 (RF) wireless technology for the transport of medical data both to and from point-of-care (PoC) medical devices. The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073- 0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519427","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

In this paper, a better combination is proposed to address problems of the previously proposed hybrid approach of combining k-Means/k-Medoids clustering technique with Naive Bayes classification. In this new approach, the need of large samples by the previous approach is reduced by using Support Vector Machine while maintaining the high quality clustering of k-Medoids. Simulations have been carried out by using Kyoto2006+ data sets in order to evaluate performance, accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate of the classification scheme.

In this paper, a new efficient intrusion detection method based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) is presented. HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion. The method is implemented and tested on the sendmail system call data from the University of New Mexico. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method in intrusion detection is better than other methods.","","0-7803-8403-2;0780384032","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378514","","Computer networks;Computer security;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent manufacturing systems;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Manufacturing systems","computer networks;hidden Markov models;probability;security of data","HMM;computer network security;defense-in-depth network security;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection method;modeling program behaviors;probability;sendmail system;system call sequence","","13","","21","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the features of their behaviors, we propose a detection technique that monitors the communications on internal networks and extracts the communication sequences of the reconnaissance. The result from our evaluation showed that the proposed technique can detect 99.26 % of the experimental reconnaissance communications by using the real 34 RATs (29 families) and 4 SMB-based remote management methods, and also work without false-positive on an actual organization's internal network.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2015.7412113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7412113","RAT;detection;internal network;reconnaissance","Feature extraction;Internet;Malware;Rats;Reconnaissance;Servers","business data processing;computer network security;invasive software","APT;RAT-based malicious activities detection;SMB-based remote management methods;detection techniques;enterprise internal networks;general security measures;reconnaissance communication sequences;remote access trojan;remote administration tools","","","","15","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed. The features satisfying the semantic hypothesis are extracted and then normalized. The normalized values are then given as input to the decision engine. The decision engine used is the Extreme Learning Machine - a new type of neural network.

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in Snorts ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","16","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
