Data mining methods can be effectively applied to (IDS) to tackle the problems of dynamic huge network data and to improve IDS performance. We can reduce the time complexity by selecting only useful features to build model for classification. There are many features selection techniques are developed either to select the features or extract features. In this paper, an evolutionary approach for feature selection is proposed which is based on mathematical intersection principle. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a search method while selecting features from full NSL KDD data set along with the intersection principle of selecting those only who appears everywhere in the experiment. The results of proposed approach when compared using classifiers, it shows tremendous growth in accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier with reduced time and minimum number of features.","","978-1-4799-6804-6;9781479968046","","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218109","Dimensionality reduction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);IDS;Naive Bayes","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Correlation;Genetic algorithms;Sociology","Internet;computational complexity;computer network security;data mining;feature extraction;feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;search problems","IDS performance improvement;Internet volume;NSL KDD data set;Naive Bayes classifier;data mining methods;effective intrusion detection system;evolutionary approach;fast detection issues;feature extraction;genetic algorithm based feature selection approach;intersection principle;malicious activity identification;mathematical intersection principle;real time attacks;search method;time complexity reduction","","0","","17","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

In this paper we proposed a change-point detection method to prevent denial-of-service attacks on VoIP systems based on session initiation protocol (SIP) protocol behavior analysis. We develop efficient adaptive sequential change-point method to detect attacks which lead to changes in network traffic. The change-point detection method employs a statistical analysis of data to detect very subtle traffic changes which from SIP protocol behavior.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706;10636706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","6","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This sensor evolved from the technology of ldquoGUIDARrdquo pioneered in the 1970's to bring intrusion location to perimeter sensors. OmniTrax theory of operation, based on a unique application of new Ultra Wideband Radar was described, as well as its feature of allowing pinpoint location of intrusions along 800m of sensor cable using a single processor. This feature is fundamentally important to direct the response force, and also for rapid debug and maintenance of the installation. Since that first presentation the sensor has been fully realized as one of the most cost-effective ranging perimeter sensors with its own integrated power and communications network. It has also been evaluated for both detection and environmental performance at our own local test site (SITE), and at independent government sensor test agencies. Further components of the technology have been developed to enlarge the range of site applications. This paper provides an update on the technology and its application including some new applications for leaky coaxial cable technology. One such new application has been selected for more detailed discussion in the paper entitled ldquoA Rapid Deployment Guided Radar Sensorrdquo that also appears in these proceedings.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4244-4169-3;9781424441693","978-1-4244-4170-9;9781424441709","10.1109/CCST.2009.5335537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335537","","Acoustic sensors;Cable TV;Coaxial cables;Military aircraft;Narrowband;Radar detection;Radiofrequency interference;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Testing","coaxial cables;sensors;ultra wideband radar","2004 International Carnahan Conference;GUIDAR;OmniTrax theory;communications network;intrusion detection system;intrusion location;omnitrax ranging leaky coaxial cable sensor technology update;perimeter sensors;pinpoint location;power network;response force;ultra wideband radar","","5","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different strategies dealing with position selection and normalization methods are presented and evaluated using a rigorous experimental procedure on realistic field data.

This method is capable of detecting unknown attacks in high speed networks. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed in this research to detect anomalies in flow-based traffic. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms.

Todaypsilas network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing. When applied to real Web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98.5% of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3633-0;9780769536330","","10.1109/SP.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207641","Forensics;HTTP;Information Leaks;Intrusion Detection;Web Traffic","Bandwidth;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Volume measurement","Internet;hypermedia;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;data loss prevention systems;hypertext transfer protocol;information leaks;network bandwidth;network traffic;outbound Web browsing traffic;protocol specifications","","16","1","27","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the distinguished graph (network) structure of a graph-based EA called genetic network programming (GNP), PMBGNP ensures higher expression ability than the conventional EDAs to solve some specific problems. Furthermore, an extended algorithm called reinforced PMBGNP is proposed to combine PMBGNP and reinforcement learning to enhance the performance in terms of fitness values, search speed, and reliability.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","","978-1-4673-7988-5;9781467379885","","10.1109/QRS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272921","Anomaly Detection Systems;Boolean Combination;Intrusion Detection Systems;Multiple-Detector Systems;Pruning Techniques","Accuracy;Boolean functions;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Training","Boolean algebra;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;PBC;anomaly detection system;intrusion detection system;machine learning technique;pruning Boolean combination;pruning technique","","","","44","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis.","","978-1-4673-4894-2;9781467348942","978-1-4673-4895-9;9781467348959","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497883","Modeling;Power Industry;Risk analysis;Security;Simulation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer security;Delays;Organizations;Software tools","cost-benefit analysis;critical infrastructures;risk analysis;security of data","PACRAT;Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool;attack delay;attack detection;attack response;automated cost-benefit analysis;blended attack;critical asset security;critical infrastructure facility;cyber components;cyber only attack;cyber-enabled physical attack;cyber-physical control system;cyber-physical interdependency;cyber-physical security vulnerability assessment integration;emplaced safeguard;facility layout;facility vulnerability prediction;high value asset security;layered defense;network topology;physical only attack;physical-enabled cyber attack;security improvement;software tool;system effectiveness reduction","","0","1","5","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present the preliminary results of applying correlation coefficients to detecting stepping-stone intrusion. The contribution of this paper is that we are the first to apply correlation coefficient to stepping-stone detection, and more importantly, it does not have to monitor a session for a long time to conclude if there is a stepping-stone intrusion.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of our knowledge, HiFIND is the first online DoS resilient flow-level intrusion detection system for high-speed networks (approximately 10s of Gigabit/second), even for the worst case trafic of 40-byte-packet streams with each packet forming a flow.","1063-6927;10636927","0-7695-2540-7;0769525407","","10.1109/ICDCS.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648826","","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Frequency;Hardware;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical)","","","","9","","17","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although primarily employed in network intrusion detection systems, feature extraction is also used to determine various other aspects of a network's behavior such as total traffic and average connection size. Current software methods used for extraction of network features fail to meet the performance requirements of next-generation high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based reconfigurable architecture for feature extraction of large high-speed networks. Our design makes use of parallel rows of hash functions and sketch tables in order to process network packets at a very high throughput. We present a detailed description of our architecture and its implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA board, and provide cycle-accurate timing results for feature extraction of input networking benchmark data.

The efficiency of intrusion detection is mainly determined by the dimension of data features. According to the feature optimization selection problems of the rare attack categories detection, this paper proposes using the cascaded SVM classifiers to classify the non-rare attack categories and using BN classifiers to classify rare attack categories, combining with cascaded GFR feature selection method (CGFR). It selects feature subset for the rare attack categories and non rare attack categories respectively.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920  1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous processes may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Switching between processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the processes during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We develop a simple closed-loop policy (i.e., decisions depend on past observations and actions) for the anomaly detection problem. Asymptotic optimality of the proposed policy is shown when a single process is observed at a time and strong performance are demonstrated by simulation examples under multi-processes probing.","","","","10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028432","Anomaly detection;Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT);sequential hypothesis testing","Conferences;Indexes;Reliability;Search problems;Sensors;Switches;Testing","closed loop systems;network theory (graphs);search problems","anomaly detection process;asymptotic optimality;closed-loop policy;independent process;multiprocess probing;reliability constraints;sequential anomalous process detection;sequential search strategy;state declarations","","1","","37","","","Sept. 30 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction.

For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4244-4488-5;9781424444885","978-1-4244-4487-8;9781424444878","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, the hierarchical network index system which consists of three layers, namely, index layer, criterion layer and target layer from bottom to top, is established. The data of the index layer processed by the fuzzy mathematics is obtained from the massive snort alarm information and vulnerability information. The evaluation index weights each layer are calculated by the improved AHP. Comprehensive evaluation is started from the index layer, and by using the evaluation index weights, the factors of security situational are obtained in the criterion layer; by calculating layer by layer upwards, the hosts' security situational values are obtained in the target layer. Finally, the network security situational value is obtained using the hosts' weights.

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.","","978-1-4799-2438-7;9781479924387","","10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485","Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection","Niobium;Probes","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks","","1","","25","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
