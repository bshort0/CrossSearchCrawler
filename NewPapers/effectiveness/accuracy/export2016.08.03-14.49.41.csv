The audit of the cloud computing system and network will provide insights on the security and performance of VMs and the operating system on multiple data centers and the intra-cloud network managed by cloud providers and the wide-area network between the cloud user and cloud provider. Thus, network traffic analysis for cloud auditing is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to verify the data security on the network between cloud provider and its users.

Along with EEG recordings, inter-ictal discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, structural placement of the epileptogenic zone and clinical description, are used in the study. The key step involved in the analysis, is to create an algorithm that shapes the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, identifying the features, forward modeling of the extracted features and finally classifying them as epileptic seizures arising from the location on the right or left region of the brain. The feature extraction is done by independent component analysis (ICA) with spatially filtered eight spectral features per components. These features are classified using Support Vector Machines with radial basis function kernels (SVM) and Proximal SVM. A comparative study is done for evaluating specificity and sensitivity using segments of ICA data. The analysis and results of both patients indicates that the specificity and sensitivity ratios are higher for ICA with SVM rather than those obtained from PSVM.

"Towards a unified approach to the representation of, and reasoning with, probabilistic risk information about software and its system interface","M. S.

ISSRE 2004. 15th International Symposium on","20050124","2004","","","391","402","Early risk assessment is key in planning the development of systems, including systems that involve software. Such risk assessment needs a combination of the following elements; 1) Severity estimates for the potential effects of failures, and likelihood estimates for their causes; 2) Fault trees that link causes to failures; 3) Efficacy estimates of design and process steps towards reducing risk; 4) Distinctions between preventing, alleviating and detecting (thereafter removing), risks; 5) Risk preventions that have potential side effects of themselves introducing risks. The paper shows a unified approach that accommodates all these elements. The approach combines fault trees (from probabilistic risk assessment methods) with explicit treatment of risk mitigations (a generalization of the notion of a detection seen in FMECA analyses). Fault trees capture the causal relationships by which failure mechanisms may combine to lead to failure modes. Risk mitigations encompass (and distinguish among) options to prevent risks, detect risks, and alleviate risks (i.e., decrease their impact should they occur). This approach has been embodied in extensions to a JPL-developed risk assessment tool, and is illustrated here on software risk assessment information drawn from an actual project's software system FMECA (failure modes, effects and criticality analysis). Since its elements are typical of risk assessment of software and its system interface, the findings should be relevant to a wide range of software systems.","1071-9458;10719458","0-7695-2215-7;0769522157","","10.1109/ISSRE.2004.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383134","Cost-benefit tradeoffs;FMEA;FMECA;FTA;Failure Modes;PRA;Probabilistic Risk Reduction;Risk-informed decision-making;SFMECA","Application software;Costs;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault trees;Protection;Risk analysis;Risk management;Software systems;Space vehicles","decision making;fault trees;maximum likelihood estimation;risk management;software development management","FTA;PRA;SFMECA;cost-benefit tradeoffs;failure modes;fault trees;probabilistic risk reduction;risk assessment;risk-informed decision-making;system interface","","7","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492","","Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads","","","","2","","19","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662;21660662","978-1-4799-3857-5;9781479938575","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","19","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","2329-6267;23296267","978-1-4244-3763-4;9781424437634","978-1-4244-3764-1;9781424437641","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","3","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms.

As IDS traces monitor large groups of servers, large amounts of network data and also spanning a variety of patterns, efficient analytical approaches are needed to address this big heterogeneous data analysis problem. We believe that using unsupervised learning methods can help to classify data that allows analysts to find out meaningful insights and extract the value of the collected data more precisely and efficiently. This study demonstrates how the technique of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) can be utilized to facilitate efficient event data analysis. For the collected IDS traces, GHSOM is used to cluster data and reveal the geometric distances between each cluster in a topological space such that the attack signatures for each cluster can be easily identified. The experimental results from a real-world IDS traces show that our proposed approach can efficiently discover several critical attack patterns and significantly reduce the size of IDS trace log which needs to be further analyzed. The proposed approach can help internet security administrators/analysts to conduct network forensics analysis, discover suspicious attack sources, and set up recovery processes to prevent previously unknown security threats such as zero-day attacks.","","","","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034762","cloud services;forensic analysis;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;internet security;intrusion detection system","Correlation;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;data analysis;digital signatures;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;IDS traces;Internet security administrators;Internet security analysts;analytical approach;attack signatures;cloud services;cluster geometric distances;complex data pattern parsing;critical attack patterns;data classification;data clustering;event data analysis;event pattern discovery;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;heterogeneous data analysis problem;intrusion detection rule sets;intrusion detection system;network forensics analysis;recovery process;suspicious attack source discovery;topological space;unsupervised learning methods","","0","","22","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a lot of clustering algorithms proposed for anomaly detection on IDS, but most of them find clusters in the highest dimension of data. CLIQUE Partitioning (CP) is one of the clustering algorithm that can find clusters from the subspace of data.

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns.

Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station). In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided. Secondly, a brief survey of IDSs proposed for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is presented and applicability of those systems to WSNs are discussed. Thirdly, IDSs proposed for WSNs are presented. This is followed by the analysis and comparison of each scheme along with their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, guidelines on IDSs that are potentially applicable to WSNs are provided.

Since many current Intrusion Detection Systems are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to them are expensive and slow. In data mining-based intrusion detection system, we should make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion detection in order to efficiently extract relative rules from large amounts of records.

It is hard to acquire optimal parameters or achieve an optimal alignment. To solve this problem, and taking advantages of genetic algorithm (GA) of global searching, parallel computing and robustness, a GA based compass alignment approach is proposed.

New platforms and applications are needed to mediate interactions between devices to overcome the inherent problems, limitations, and costs of bespoke solutions. While combining our disparate devices to meet future needs is challenging, it will also allow for better exploitation of networked devices to provide obvious benefits to the consumer. A number of approaches and technologies that attempt to redress this issue exist; however, they are not without their own disadvantages.

It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors","Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning","Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol","","0","1","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, and exploit this questionable assumption to subvert VM introspection. In particular, we present an attack called DKSM (Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation), and show that it can effectively foil existing VM introspection solutions into providing false information.

Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate.

In spite of its huge success, most ensemble methods tend to generate unnecessary large number of classifiers, which entails an increase in memory storage, computational cost, and even a reduction of the generalization performance of the ensemble. Ensemble selection addresses these shortcomings by searching for a fraction of individual classifiers that performs as good as, or better than the entire ensemble. In this paper, we formulate the problem of ensemble selection as a coalitional game in a graph form, and name the approach ISCG-Ranking. The proposed game aims at capturing two crucial concepts that affect the performance of an ensemble: accuracy and diversity. Most importantly, it ranks every classifier based on its contribution in keeping a proper balance between these two notions using Shapley value. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art techniques on 26 UCI benchmark datasets. The results reveal that ISCG-Ranking significantly improves the original ensemble and performs better than other methods in most cases.","1082-3409;10823409","","","10.1109/ICTAI.2015.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372193","Coalitional Games;Core;Ensemble Pruning;Ensemble Selection;Ensemble of Classifiers;Game Theory;Induced Subgraph Games;Shapley Value","Computational efficiency;Game theory;Games;Information theory;Random variables;Resource management;Training","game theory;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CGT;ISCG-Ranking;Shapley value;UCI benchmark datasets;classifier;coalitional game theory;ensemble learning;ensemble selection;graph form;induced subgraph coalitional game","","","","44","","","9-11 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously.

The purpose of this research is to construct a holistic solution that is able to firstly reduce the number of alerts to be processed and at the same time produce a high quality attack scenarios that are meaningful to the administrators in a timely manner. To achieve these goals, alerts generated by IDS sensors need to be correlated and organized in an appropriate approach.

However, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, especially in the routing layer because of their open environment and the communication happens based on the mutual trust among the nodes. An appropriate intrusion detection system is an inevitable requirement. Using anomaly based intrusion detection system results in the false positive identification of the intrusion. Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822;21556822","978-1-4577-0753-7;9781457707537","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","2","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an attack flow traceback scheme which is based on flow digests and network layer data. Digesting flow instead of individual packet would save memory and be more scalable.

Understanding the underlying cause is critical for the deployment of effective response measures aimed at restoring the network functionality. Shebaro et al. [9] proposed an initial approach for fine-grained analysis (FGA) of packet losses, and implemented and evaluated a tool based on it. Such approach profiles the wireless links between the nodes using resident metrics, such as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the link quality indicator (LQI) for every packet, in order to achieve an accurate diagnosis of their root causes. The accuracy of their approach relies on the correct choice of some system parameters and thresholds, and empirically-determined values such as those proposed in their work might not always be optimal. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the network administrator, their approach uses a single threshold value set for the entire WSN, which can be suitable for some neighborhoods but not appropriate for others. In this work, we design an approach that builds a statistical model for determining optimal system thresholds by exploiting the variances of RSSI and LQI. Our model also has the advantage of allowing the setting of an individual threshold for each link. We have validated our approach through extensive MATLAB simulations based on real sensor data, showing that our model is accurate and its system parameters lead to an optimally-accurate fine-grained analysis of the underlying causes of packet losses.","","","","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300899","LQI;RSSI;WSN;interference;variance","Interference;Mathematical model;Packet loss;Testing;Wireless sensor networks","RSSI;wireless sensor networks","LQI;RSSI;link quality indicator;optimal system thresholds;packet losses;received signal strength indicator;resident metrics;statistically-enhanced fine-grained diagnosis;wireless links;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a supporting tool called PORTAM for such users and providers to understand the threats and the requirements. Suppose some requirements cannot be satisfied when some threats are avoided, and vice versa. In such cases, they should decide whether the requirements should be satisfied or the threats should be avoided. The tool also helps them to decide such kinds of trade-offs.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks.

IEEE","20021107","2002","3","","1530","1539","We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","87","8","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless technologies including 802.15.4, 802.11, and the Zigbee protocol. Each of these will expose the power grid to cyber security threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Smart Grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the Analyzing Module (AM) in the multiple layers of smart grids.

However, the inherent security weaknesses of the WS platform have lead to these WS-based applications being vulnerable and targets for attacks. This paper identifies and describes the various vulnerabilities and security threats pertaining to WS. After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced. Through illustration by examples, the framework demonstrated that by making use of agents that act as sensors, data mining techniques such as clustering, association and sequential rule coupled with fuzzy logic to further analyze and identify anomalies, is able to exhibit the adaptive nature of capturing anomalies and avoiding false alarms.","","0-7695-3038-9;0769530389","","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420313","","Computer crime;Electronic mail;Fuzzy logic;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Simple object access protocol;Web services;XML","Web services;security of data","Web service platform;Web service security;Web technology;adaptive intrusion detection;adaptive intrusion prevention","","8","","29","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to design and develop reliable and secure network services, rapid detection and quick response to these attacks are major concern. In practice, there is no scheme that completely detects or prevents the DDoS attack. Predicting number of zombies in a DDoS attack is helpful to suppress the effect of DDoS attack by filtering and rate limiting the most suspicious attack sources or improve DDoS response system. In this paper, we present machine learning approach based on support vector machine for regression to predict the number of zombies in a DDoS attack. MATLAB implementation of support vector machine for regression and datasets generated using NS-2 network simulators running on Linux platform are used for training and testing.

By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists. In this paper, we lay out the basis of D-MASs accuracy assessment and we present an evaluation of eight of these systems.
