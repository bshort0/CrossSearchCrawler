"The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection","M. Al-Subaie; M. Zulkernine","Queen's Univ., Kingston","2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","20070813","2007","","","1391","1398","A clear deficiency in most of todays anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the existing approaches either are rigid, inflexible designs tailored to a specific situation or require manual setting of design parameters such as the initial number of clusters. In this paper we allow the design parameters to be determined dynamically by adopting a layered hybrid architecture, hence resolving the aforementioned shortcomings. The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user. The simulation result shows high detection rates as well as fewer false positives compared to earlier approaches.","","978-1-4577-0040-8;9781457700408","978-0-7695-4393-2;9780769543932","10.1109/CNSR.2011.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771201","computational intelligence;fuzzy clustering evaluation;radial basis function;software architecture","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Principal component analysis;Radial basis function networks;Training","computer network security;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;radial basis function networks","FCM fuzzy clustering;GK fuzzy clustering;RBF neural networks;adaptive hybrid architecture;automatic detection;design parameters;intrusion detection;layered hybrid architecture;network intrusion","","1","","21","","","2-5 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many biological analyses, such as multi-omics data analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis, it is crucial to find groups of data belonging to subtypes of diseases or tumors. Methods: Conventionally, the k-means clustering algorithm is overwhelmingly applied in many areas including biological sciences. There are, however, several alternative clustering algorithms that can be applied, including support vector clustering. In this paper, taking into consideration the nature of biological data, we propose a maximum likelihood clustering scheme based on a hierarchical framework. Results: This method can perform clustering even when the data belonging to different groups overlap. It can also perform clustering when the number of samples is lower than the data dimensionality. Conclusion: The proposed scheme is free from selecting initial settings to begin the search process. In addition, it does not require the computation of the first and second derivative of likelihood functions, as is required by many other maximum likelihood based methods. Significance: This algorithm uses distribution and centroid information to cluster a sample and was applied to biological data.

The sensor network is considered to be heterogeneous. It uses a PIR sensor for movement detection, an RFID sensor for identifying the person and an image sensor for verification. This system uses both wired and wireless networks for efficient data transfer. Data from either networks are synchronised using time and location information.

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters. These optimum static polling rates introduce minimum and maximum thresholds for the various scenarios mobile devices encounter on a daily basis.

Information about potentially privacy violating rules can subsequently be used to tune the IDS rule sets, with the objective to minimise the expected amount of data privacy violations during normal operation.

In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2294473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786500","Anomaly detection;GOOSE anomaly detection;SMV anomaly detection and intrusion detection;cyber security of substations","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Power grids;Substation automation","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;substation automation","ADS;GOOSE;IED;SMV;catastrophic power outages;circuit breakers;cyber intrusions;generic object oriented substation event;host-based anomaly detection systems;integrated anomaly detection system;intelligent electronic devices;malicious behaviors;multicast messages;network-based anomaly detection systems;physical security;power grid;sampled measured value;severe cascading events;simultaneous anomaly detection;simultaneous intrusion detection method;substation automation testbed;substation facilities;substations;temporal anomalies;user-interfaces","","4","","37","","2014-04-10","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable. MicroTrack complies with radio regulatory requirements for low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors in the HF band.","","0-7803-7436-3;0780374363","","10.1109/CCST.2002.1049250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049250","","Acoustic pulses;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Coaxial cables;Hafnium;Leak detection;Microwave sensors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ultra wideband radar","CW radar;access control;coaxial cables;fast Fourier transforms;radar applications;radar signal processing;sensors","FM CW radar techniques;Intrepid MicroTrack leaky coaxial cable sensor;barrier mounted applications;buried applications;digital processing components;fast Fourier transform;high speed high resolution analog to digital converters;intruder detection;intruder location;low cost direct digital synthesis chips;low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors;precise target location;radio regulatory requirements;surface applications;swept frequency response translation;ultra wide band HF terrain following radar","","4","2","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the method with a false alarm rate as low as 0.001%.","","978-1-4244-5879-0;9781424458790","","10.1109/ARES.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438076","","Application software;Availability;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;statistical analysis","anomaly intrusion detection;anomaly score;higher order n-grams;layered n-gram version;network packet payload data;statistical methods","","2","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the widely used intrusion detection techniques. However, many ANN-based methods are faced with unsatisfactory results and low detection precision. A new intrusion detection method by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is proposed. PNN divides inputs into two groups, normal and abnormal. Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time.

An Unsupervised CA based anomaly detection technique that was trained with unlabelled data is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks. This new approach, based on the Cellular Automata classifier (CAC) with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to classify program behavior as normal or intrusive. Parameters and evolution process for CAC with GA are discussed in detail. This implementation considers both temporal and spatial information of network connections in encoding the network connection information into rules in NIDS. Preliminary experiments with KDD Cup data set show that the CAC classifier with Genetic Algorithms can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate.

One of the major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect.

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","5","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To consider the effect of danger signals, the results of decision templates algorithm are redefined by adding a kind of suspicion signal. So, the detection templates should be modified online, and a template-adjustable adaptive decision fusion algorithm is proposed. There are two benefits in the TAIDS. First, when it is difficult to distinguish current behaviors depending on familiar features, The TAIDS will discriminate them by means of danger theory, making false alarms reduced and the ability of identifying novel attacks enhanced. Second, the adaptive decision templates algorithm allows detection templates to modify dynamically without periodical updating. Experiments are carried out on KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this system. The false positive rate is 2.27%,and the accuracies on known attacks and on unknown attacks are respectively 97.67% and 98.75%.","","1-4244-1075-4;1424410754","1-4244-1076-2;1424410762","10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239103","danger theory;data fusion algorithm;intrusion detection","Adaptive control;Adaptive systems;Control systems;Educational institutions;Immune system;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Mechatronics;Programmable control;Signal detection","security of data","TAIDS;adaptive decision templates algorithm;danger theory;decision templates algorithm;immune network theory;three-level-module adaptive intrusion detection system","","2","","9","","","15-17 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Intrusion detection model using fusion of PCA and optimized SVM","I. S. Thaseen; C. A.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a scalable algorithm able to deal with IP traffic at a very high bit rate thanks to the use of hashing functions over a sliding window. Moreover it does not need any a priori knowledge about traffic characteristics.

In this paper we will present a comprehensive architecture for NIDPS which is comprised of the main components and the data flow between them. This architecture consists of all NIDPS components including capture and decoding module, preprocessing, detection, response and management. The detection module will cover both misuse based and anomaly based approaches. Moreover, anomaly based detection module includes traffic and protocol anomaly detection as well as learning based approaches. The proposed architecture is designed to perform in four modes of operation: passive response mode, active response mode, fast prevention mode, and perfect prevention mode. Moreover, it is capable to work in high speed networks due to the existence of fast prevention mode.

Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process. For verifying the detection accuracy of our classifier, User to Root and Remote to Local attacks of DARPA KDD99 Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set were used.

Depending on the complexity of the firewall ruleset, filtering performance of the IDS can decrease considerably during high-load flooding situations. In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules to limit the number of firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed.

In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms. Finally, we apply our findings to evaluate bot assessment strategies for forensic analysis after a worm tree has been formed.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218774","Botnet;detection;probabilistic modeling;simulation;topology;worm infection family tree","Analytical models;Grippers;Internet;Joints;Mathematical model;Measurement;Peer to peer computing","Internet;Poisson distribution;computer network security;geometry;invasive software;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","Internet worm infection family tree characteristics;Poisson distribution;approximate-logarithmic average path length;asymptotic geometric distribution;bot assessment strategies;botnets;children;forensic analysis;host infection ability quantification;localized-scanning worms;mathematical analysis;permutation-scanning worms;probabilistic modeling methods;security threats;sequential growth model;simulations;vulnerable host;worm infection topology","","1","","40","","2012-06-15","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET.

Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association. Our approach is to extend the multiple hypothesis tracking framework, from the standard kinematic domain, to the cyber domain.

A novel 'multiple' smoothing parameters, which is different from the standard algorithm in which only single smoothing parameter was adopted (Matlab neural network toolbox, for example), were assigned to GRNN model. K-means clustering algorithm was developed so as to reduce the number of smoothing parameters. The training data was firstly partitioned into groups (the number of groups was much smaller than that of training samples) using K-means clustering. A smoothing parameter was then assigned to this group. A recently emerging estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) was employed to optimize the multiple smoothing parameters. EDA presented in this paper was a kind of optimization algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to establish a non-linear model between the parameters of the coal-fired boiler and the NOx emissions. The results showed that the number of cluster has significant effect on the predictive accuracy of GRNN model.

In order to continue their malevolent activities without being detected, cyber criminals make efforts to conceal the core servers (e.g., C&C servers, exploit servers, and drop-zone servers) in the malicious web infrastructure. Such deliberate invisibility of those concealed malicious servers, however, makes them particularly distinguishable from benign web servers that are usually promoted to be public. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study to investigate the visibility of both malicious and benign servers. From our intensive analysis of over 100,000 benign servers, 45,000 malicious servers and 40,000 redirections, we identify a set of distinct features of malicious web infrastructures from their locations, structures, roles, and relationships perspectives, and propose a lightweight yet effective detection system called VisHunter. VisHunter identifies malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures. We evaluate VisHunter on both online public data and large-scale enterprise network traffic, and demonstrate that VisHunter can achieve an average 96.2% detection rate with only 0.9% false positive rate on the real enterprise network traffic.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524582","","Feature extraction;Indexes;Malware;Search engines;Superluminescent diodes;Web servers","","","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A harder problem to crack in the field of Network Security is the identification and prevention of attacks. An effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks. Genetic algorithm based clustering offers identification of significant reduced input features. We present a conceptual framework for identifying attacks for intrusion detection by applying genetic K-means algorithm.","","978-1-4799-3913-8;9781479939138","","10.1109/ICACCCT.2014.7019418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019418","Intrusion;attack signature;clustering;fitness value;routing algorithm","Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Protocols","computer crime;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IDS;attack identification;attack prevention;clustering method;communication system security;feature identification;genetic K-means algorithm;intrusion detection system;machine learning pattern recognition technique;pattern analysis technique;statistical technique;unknown attack pattern detection;wireless sensor network security","","0","","10","","","8-10 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future.

In many-to-one communication the adversary attracts its surrounding neighbor nodes with false routing information and fake identities. The existing researches have focused on single layer attacks. In their work they target only one specific layer and detect the attack, without considering other layers into account. Our proposed detection technique maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross layer features and Mobile agent based approach in two phases. In first phase, attacks are detected by correlating the cross layer features such as MAC and Network layers. During second phase, if the attacks are detected, mobile agent based technique is applied to prevent the attack. Here the data is forwarded through the mobile agent. The mobile agent solves the security problem by using three step negotiations. Through this mobile agent based approach, the false positive rate can be reduced and improving the energy efficiency than the existing approach.","","","","10.1109/ICICES.2016.7518935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518935","Cross layer;Mobile agent;Security;Sinkhole attack;Sybil attack","Base stations;Cross layer design;Feature extraction;Mobile agents;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","25-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of credit-based networking - borrowing ideas from financial management and adapting them to network management. We first focus on a campus network by studying concrete scenarios of how credit-based network management can be applied. We then discuss how the concept is generally applicable to managing network behaviors as well by applying it to managing ISP peering relationships. We argue that the cascading effect of credit-based network management can enhance network management efficiency and improve the global network environment we all live in.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4244-2912-7;9781424429127","978-1-4244-2913-4;9781424429134","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808889","","Computer network management;Concrete;Environmental management;Financial management","computer network management;security of data;telecommunication security","ISP peering relationships;cascading effect;computer network administrator;credit based networking;credit-based network management;financial management;global network environment;malicious users;network management efficiency;user behavioral problems","","0","","10","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The drawback of misuse based approach is that it cannot detect new type of attacks. Hence anomaly based intrusion detection were used and it is capable of detecting unknown attacks also.

Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets.

The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value.

Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning.

The detection of this type of attack at the network level can overcome the scalability issue of host-based detection methods. In this paper, we provide a machine learning approach for the detection of SSH brute force attacks at the network level. Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models. Our results show that the models built upon these features provide excellent performances for the detection of brute force attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424322","Aggregated Netflows;Brute Force;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Force;Intrusion detection","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","Netflow data;Netflow feature;SSH brute force attack traffic;SSH failed login data;SSH traffic;aggregated netflow data;campus network;computer network;discern brute force traffic;extracting discriminative feature;failed login traffic;host-based detection method;inspection;legitimate user;machine learning approach;machine learning model;machine learning task;network level;password combination;prevalent attack;representative collection","","","","21","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This leads to a huge consumption of system resources. In this paper, we put forward an approach that dynamically adjusts the objects a HIDS monitors according to the expected attack scenario. To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model. Therefore, our model considers the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the resource consumption. Analysis and simulation results prove that our approach can effectively decrease the resource consumption of the HIDS taking into consideration the detection accuracy.","2160-4886;21604886","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","10.1109/WiMob.2008.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654280","Game theory;Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems;resources consumption","Analytical models;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Probes;Systems engineering and theory","game theory;security of data","HIDS;game theoretic approach;host-based intrusion detection system;multiple-step attack;resource consumption","","1","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy. In addition, the training data classification performance of the actively learned model was comparable to that of the C4.5 decision tree.","","978-1-4244-8097-5;9781424480975","","10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558967","","Artificial neural networks;Biological system modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Training;Training data","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","C4.5 decision tree;DARPA KDD-1999;active learning;computer network intrusion detection;data mining;machine learning techniques;network traffic instances;neural networks;very large training dataset size","","2","","29","","","4-6 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These types of WSN rely on cluster heads for data aggregation and transmission towards sink node. Subsequently cluster head nodes are outfitted with high energy. Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8;9781479998548","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1;9780989319331","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","1","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
