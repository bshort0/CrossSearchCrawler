The aim of this paper is the description of a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis of IMs using signal-based method.

The DDoS dataset with various direct and derived attributes is generated in an experimental testbed which has 14 attributes and 10 types of latest DDoS attack classes. Using the generated DDoS dataset the Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM) is used for detection of the attacks into various classes. The performance of the EMCSVM is evaluated over SVM with various parameter values and kernel functions.

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.","","978-953-6114-93-1;9789536114931","","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2007.4446129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446129","","Application software;Communication standards;Communications technology;Computer science;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Throughput","DiffServ networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","automatic flow classification;differentiated services;legacy flow classification;machine learning;network standard;packet-level data","","2","","30","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis.

This has potential application to reducing human-animal conflicts in the vicinity of a wildlife park. The system takes on the form of a sensor-tower platform (STP) and was developed in-house. It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. This approach to classification was validated by making use of real-world data collected by the STP which showed both STP design as well as classification technique employed to be quite effective. The average classification accuracy with both real and simulated data was in excess of 94%.","","978-1-4799-8054-3;9781479980543","","10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106914","Wireless sensor network;animation;chirplets;intrusion detection;passive infrared sensor;sensor array","Animals;Arrays;Chirp;Clutter;Sensors","computer animation;feature extraction;forestry;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;support vector machines","Blender and OpenGL software;PIR sensing based intrusion detection system;STP design;SVM;animal intrusions;animation-and-chirplet based approach;cross-correlation parameter;energy signature;feature vector;human intrusions;human-animal conflicts;intruder classification;passive infrared sensing based intrusion detection system;sensor-tower platform;spatial-resolution capability;support vector machine;vegetative clutter;wildlife park","","0","","13","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, securing network from inside is necessary, particularly when security hierarchical exist between users. One of the major problems in conducting research on IPv6 security is the absence of a reliable dataset, which is essential in testing and evaluating the proposed solutions. This research develops a reliable dataset of IPv6 NDP by capturing the normal and abnormal behaviors of NDP using specific dependable tools.

So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8;9781457719318","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","2154-0217;21540217","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This demands for an effective mechanism to establish trust among participants in a high-level abstract way, capturing relevant factors ranging on Service Level Agreement, security policies, requirements, regulations, constraints, Quality of Service, reputation, and recommendation. Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey. This survey examines and explores the role of trust in service workflows and their contexts from a wide variety of literatures. Various mechanisms, architecture, techniques, standards, and frameworks are explained along the way with discussions.

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems etc.).

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by licit and illicit network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor.

In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module.

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the immense increase of the number of users of Facebook made it rise to become the largest existing social network with more than 1.2 billion active users. However, these numbers also rose the attention of hackers and attackers who aim at propagating malware and viruses for obtaining confidential information regarding social network users. In this manner, it is crucial that each Facebook user is able to easily access, control and analyse the information shared on the corresponding profile so that profile usage deviations can be more efficiently detected. However, despite the fact that Facebook allows an analysis of all user actions through the Timeline Review, this information is not comprehensively organized and there is no statistical analysis of the user generated data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework comprising a Facebook event collector, which by being provided with an authentication token for a user profile obtained through a Facebook application developed for this purpose, collects all the corresponding posted information and stores it in a relational database for a posteriori analysis. Through the graphical interface of the developed application, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user's behaviour. By storing each event with the corresponding timestamp, we are able to perform an efficient and comprehensive analysis of all posted contents and compute statistical models over the obtained data. In this manner, we can create a notion of normal usage profile and detect possible deviations which may be indicative of a compromised user account.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912474","Monitoring Framework;Profile Hijack;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Analytical models;Authentication;Computational modeling;Databases;Facebook;Monitoring","computer viruses;graphical user interfaces;information dissemination;relational databases;social networking (online);statistical analysis","Facebook event collector framework;Timeline Review;authentication token;content dissemination;graphical interface;information dissemination;malware;normal usage profile;posted content analysis;profile monitoring purposes;profile usage deviations;relational database;social networks;statistical models;viruses","","0","","15","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in this paper we propose a novel approach, combining systemic and behavioral features focusing on the CMD phase that the attacker sends commands to the victim. Through the detection method driven in this article, at first we gather the systemic and behavioral alerts produced while the attacker is installing and utilizing the backdoor interactively and then categorize them by specific features selected to give scores to the both aspects seen. Scores are given in two steps. The first step based on the prominent systemic alerts selected which are specified to backdoors and in the second step we give scores to the behavior it has in the command phase by creating and running a Markov Model. Literally, the scores are normalized and aggregated to determine the probability of backdoor residence on the computer monitored. We evaluated the algorithm in six different scenarios and by a group of well-known backdoors to make distinction between the proposed method and prior works.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2015.7387910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387910","Backdoor;Intrusion detection;Markov Model;Security","Computers;Information security;Malware;Markov processes;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","Markov processes;computer network security","CMD phase;Markov model;attacker;backdoor residence;behavioral features;computer system;network attacks;normal authentication methods;system based backdoor detection;systemic alerts","","","","12","","","8-10 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions.

Several diagnostic tools such as Ganglia, Ambari, and Cloudera Manager are available to monitor health of a cluster, however, they do not provide algorithms to detect security threats or perform user activity monitoring. Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable system that can detect malicious user activities, especially in real-time, so that appropriate actions can be taken against the user. At eBay, we developed such a system named Eagle, which collects audit logs from Hadoop clusters and applications running on them, analyzes users behavior, generates profiles per user of the system, and predicts anomalous user activities based on their prior profiles. Eagle is a highly scalable system, capable of monitoring multiple eBay clusters in real-time. It includes machine-learning algorithms that create user profiles based on the user's history of activities. As far as we know, this is the first activity monitoring system on the Hadoop-ecosystem for the detection of intrusion-related activities using behavior-based profiles of users. When a user performs any operation in the cluster, Eagle matches current user action against his prior activity pattern and raises alarm if it suspects anomalous action. We investigate two machine-learning algorithms: density estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we introduce the Eagle system, discuss the algorithms in detail, and show performance results. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the density estimation algorithm is 93%, however the sensitivity of our system increases by 4.94% (on average) to 98% (approximately) by using an ensemble of the two algorithms during anomaly detection.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363892","Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster;machine learning;user activity monitoring;user profiles","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Training","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","Big data analytics;Eagle system;Hadoop cluster;Hadoop-ecosystem;PCA;density estimation;eBay;intrusion-related activity;machine-learning algorithm;principal component analysis;security threat;user profile-based anomaly detection","","","","30","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such solutions for MANETs have seen limited use. This paper introduces a specification-based detection engine that is built upon the functionality and limitations of the 802.11 MAC protocol, expanding the detection range of such engines in MANETs. The proposed detection engine is deployed at each node and performs detection using a set of specifications, which describe the correct operation of the MAC protocol operating at the host node. The proposed engine introduces a number of significant advantages since it can effectively detect both known and unknown attacks in real time and with minimum overhead.

In this paper, we introduce a highly flexible, programmable, multi-purpose networking platform, which is capable of hosting multiple 1 and 10 Gbit/s Ethernet interfaces - beside their 40 or 100 Gbit/s interface. The hardware of the introduced C-GEP platform is reconfigurable, even on-the-fly; due to the FPGA technology. C-GEP can host a wide range of high-speed network specific applications - including monitoring, switching and media conversion -, and it is aligned with the SDN principles. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom specific hardware platform and the firmware tailored to the actual task.

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data used for classification was KDDCUP'99 which is a benchmark data set for intrusion detection and suffers greatly from class imbalance problem. Noise was also added to data to evaluate the performance of classifiers for noisy data. Different combinations of strategies form different scenarios.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","3","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to overcome this threat, organizations apply enterprise content-aware data leakage prevention (DLP) solutions to monitor and control data access and usage. However, this paper argues that current solutions are not able to reliably protect information assets. The analyses of data breaches reported in 2014 reveal a significant number of data leakage incidents that are not within the focus of the DLP solutions. Furthermore, these analyses indicate that the classification of the provided data breach records is not qualified for detailed investigations. Therefore, advanced criteria for characterizing data leakage incidents are introduced, and the reported records are extended. The resulting analyses illustrate that DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) demand various information security (IS) measures to be established in order to reduce the risk of technologically based data breaches. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) measures is significantly influenced by non-technological aspects, such as the human factor.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy. As a result of finding imperfect self-region radius we have faced weak detectors that couldn't recognize anomaly perfectly.

One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4;9781424492114","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions. Each algorithm discovers those substructures that match the closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly.","","978-0-7695-3568-5;9780769535685","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804450","","Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching;Personnel;Terrorism","graph theory;pattern matching;security of data","insider threat detection;labeled graph-based anomaly detection system;labeled vertex;minimum description length principle;normative pattern matching;unauthorized access identification","","4","","8","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a host-based IDS model, utilizing a Radial Basis Function neural network. It functions as a combined anomaly/misuse detector that helps to overcome most of the limitations in existing models.

The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets.

Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a security panacea as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process.

Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision.

To detect the attacks hitting the network it is very obligatory to properly monitor the flow of network data. Network data is pre-processed before classification. Feature Selection is one of the preprocessing technique which eliminates irrelevant features and select more informative features from the data set with respect to the task to be performed. Feature Selection techniques is adopted as it is computationally efficient, simplified, have more feature interpretability, less learning time, improves data relevancy. Feature Selection can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. Feature Selection selects a subset of the features in the training set and further using this subset as features in classification. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features from the dataset. On selecting the features, classification is performed for detecting the intrusion.","","978-9-3805-4415-1;9789380544151","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100415","Attribute Evaluator;Classification;Dimensional Reduction;Feature Extraction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Search methods","data reduction;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","IDS;classifier combination;dimension reduction technique;feature selection;intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following a model driven paradigm, a method is proposed to reinforce the security of these complex widely distributed systems. The method guides system re-engineering and is based upon timed models. It encompasses reverse engineering, symbolic, and testing techniques to model, analyze, and deploy attack testing. In early stages of the method, a reference timed model to support security analyses is designed via reverse engineering and symbolic execution. During latter stages, the nominal models are enriched so as to specify attack scenarios which are symbolically executed to prove the ability of the system to detect attacker intrusions. In final stages, the attack scenarios are used to specify test cases which are later deployed to test the system. The method and main outcomes are presented relying upon a Smart Grid subsystem analyzed in the scope of a joint academy-industry project.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515609","model driven re-engineering;model-based testing;reverse engineering for modeling;security testing;smart grids;symbolic analysis;timed UML model","Analytical models;Monitoring;Registers;Reverse engineering;Safety;Security;Smart grids","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of BIAs for the computer networking field, in which different BIAs are organized and explored based on their: (1) biological source; (2) mathematical model; (3) major application; (4) advantages to corresponding classic approach; (5) limitations and border conditions; and (6) potential directions for future applications. The paper also compares performance amongst each type of BIA, and compares BIAs that are inspired by different biological sources but are applicable to similar networking applications. The paper concludes by offering a framework for understanding the application of BIAs to problems in the computer networking space.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2013.010413.00175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422291","artificial immune systems;biological symbiosis;biologically inspired algorithms;cellular signaling networks;chemotaxis and morphogenesis;computer networking;corpse clustering and brood sorting;division of labor;foraging;homeostasis;information epidemics;pattern formation;predator-prey relationship;pulse-coupled oscillator;self-organization","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological system modeling;Computer security;Routing","bio-inspired materials;computer networks","biologically inspired algorithms;computer networking;dynamic changes;large scale networks","","2","","186","","2013-01-28","Third Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Using Hilbert-Huang Transform to Characterize Intrusions in Computer Networks","W. Wang; K. Pei; X.

This paper presents a new method based on Hilbert-Huang trans- form (HHT) to characterize intrusions that can detect many kinds of intrusion according to the number of packets. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of such a method to differentiate abnormal data from normal data. Experiments are performed using intrusion detection data sets and tested for validation. Some results are reported along with analysis and concluding remarks.","2157-9555;21579555","978-0-7695-2875-5;9780769528755","","10.1109/ICNC.2007.801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4344938","","Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Programming;Space technology;Testing","Hilbert transforms;computer networks;security of data","Hilbert-Huang transform;computer networks;intrusion detection data sets;malicious intrusion;network security","","0","","13","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
