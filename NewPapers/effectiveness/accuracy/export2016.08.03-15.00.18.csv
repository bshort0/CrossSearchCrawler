This study aims to optimize threshold parameters, the size of which increases with the number of traffic sequence. Different values of network traffic sequence were generated and simulated by the NS2 tool. Based on these values, the detection rates of the CUSUM algorithm and multi-class CUSUM algorithms, as well as their false positive rates, are then evaluated.

In this paper, we propose a defensive executing technique and analyze its effectiveness. Our technique concurrently executes multiple paths of a transactional processes based on the prediction generated by a discrete time Markov chain.

Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. This paper presents a novel based approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the database.

Utilizing a small commercial solar cell of 2.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, the proposed system can provide 0-29 W of power, which is much higher than the commonly used passive radio-frequency identification devices in IOT application. The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme. A supercapacitor is utilized for buffering, energy storing, and filtering purposes, which enables more functions of the IOT smart nodes such as active sensing and system-on-chip (SOC) signal processing. The output voltage ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 V for different device loads, such as sensors, SOC, or wireless transceivers.

Therefore, a range of recent studies have focused on evaluating different machine learning classifiers with the aim of identifying the most appropriate classifier to be used for particular decision making problem-domain. The majority of these studies have used a single dataset within a certain medical-related classification domain. Nevertheless, evaluating machine-learning classifiers with one sample of data appears to be unsatisfying, perhaps it is not reflecting the classifiers capabilities or their behavioral patterns under different circumstances. In this study, five well-known supervised machine-learning classifiers were examined using five different real-world datasets with a range of attributes. The main aim was to illustrate not only the impact of the datasets volume and attributes on the evaluation, but also and more importantly, present the classifiers capabilities and shortcomings under certain conditions, which potentially provide a guidance or instructions to help health analysts and researchers to determine the most suitable classifier to address a particular medical-related decision making problem.","2157-8672;21578672","978-1-4673-8352-3;9781467383523","","10.1109/IWSSIP.2015.7314218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314218","classification accuracy;clinical decision support system;evaluation;machine learning;sensitivity;time complexity","Accuracy;Diseases;Liver;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","decision support systems;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CDSS;behavioral pattern;behavioural pattern;clinical decision support system;decision making problem-domain;health analyst;health care system;machine learning classifier;machine-learning technique;medical application;medical-related classification domain;medical-related decision making;real-world dataset;supervised machine-learning classifier","","","","21","","","10-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.","","978-1-4244-3999-7;9781424439997","978-0-7695-3639-2;9780769536392","10.1109/WAINA.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630","Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP","security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer","","1","","24","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model has a higher efficiency in reconstructing attack path by using a novel authenticated packet marking scheme for IP trace-back. So, it can correspond to the attack flow in a short time.

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","15","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, a need exists to formulate effective and efficient security measures that safeguard these applications impacted from attack in the sensor cloud. However, analyzing the impact of different attacks and their causeconsequence relationship is a prerequisite before security measures can be either developed or deployed. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment framework for WSNs in a sensor cloud that utilizes attack graphs. We use Bayesian networks to not only assess but also to analyze attacks on WSNs. The risk assessment framework will first review the impact of attacks on a WSN and estimate reasonable time frames that predict the degradation of WSN security parameters like confidentiality, integrity and availability. Using our proposed risk assessment framework allows the security administrator to better understand the threats present and take necessary actions against them. The framework is validated by comparing the assessment results with that of the results obtained from different simulated attack scenarios.","1939-1374;19391374","","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2544307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437478","Attack graphs;bayesian networks;risk assessment;security;sensor clouds;wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;Cloud computing;Clouds;Estimation;Risk management;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","2016-03-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to effectively implement this method, this paper proposes a progressive, globally deploy able sentinel scheme for data sampling, packet inspection, and DoS attack detection and recovery. A simulation framework is developed to study the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show a significant improvement in how the network deals with DoS attacks, in comparison to local DoS detection and prevention schemes.","1080-241X;1080241X","0-7695-2559-8;0769525598","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612838","","Collaboration;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer worms;Grid computing;Inspection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sampling methods","grid computing;security of data;system recovery","DoS attack detection;DoS attack recovery;basic protection scheme;data sampling;denial-of-service;distributed DoS attack;distributed defense method;grid environment;packet inspection;perimeter-based model","","0","","21","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the security features of GUIDEX against free riders, dishonest insiders and DoS attacks.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.121214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354280","Intrusion detection systems;collaborative networks;game theory;incentive compatibility;network optimization;network security and economics","Communication networks;Computer crime;Computer security;Economics;Intrusion detection;Security;Telecommunication services","Internet;computer network security;game theory","DoS attacks;GUIDEX IDN system;IDS peers;Nash equilibrium;collaborative IDS network;detection knowledge;discrete event simulation;dishonest insiders;free riders;game-theoretic incentive-based mechanism;game-theoretic modeling;intrusion assessment;intrusion detection networks;intrusion detection systems;iterative algorithm;resource management component;security features;trust management","","3","","33","","","December 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference.

But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naive bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117","Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis","BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities","","0","","27","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack.

As we have applied attribute subset reduction on the basis of Information gain. So the training time and complexity reduced considerably. Moreover, we embedded a soft computing approach in rule generation makes the rule more efficient than hard computing approach used in existing genetic algorithm.

In CIDSs, a number of IDS sensors work together for creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Our contribution in this paper is a novel distributed and scalable CIDS, called SkipMon. Our system supports, both, the idea of locality and privacy preserving communication by means of exchanging compact alert data. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for interconnecting sensors that experience similar traffic patterns.

The monitoring crew will be responsible for identifying the anomaly within the aircraft and take necessary preventive actions. With the introduction of additional technology within the aircraft, mere human perception may not be sufficient to make a decision. In this research work, the authors explore the possibility of implementing a smart video surveillance system (SVSS) within the aircraft that is tuned towards detecting the behavioral anomaly within the aircraft. The SVSS will generate security triggers when it detects an anomaly within the aircraft.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

The current literature for CBAS primarily focuses on the accuracy of the system in order to reduce false alarms. However, these attempts do not consider various issues that might affect practicality in real world applications and continuous authentication scenarios. One of the main issues is that the presented CBAS are based on several samples of training data either of both intruder and valid users or only the valid users' profile. This means that historical profiles for either the legitimate users or possible attackers should be available or collected before prediction time. However, in some cases it is impractical to gain the biometric data of the user in advance (before detection time). Another issue is the variability of the behaviour of the user between the registered profile obtained during enrollment, and the profile from the testing phase. The aim of this paper is to identify the limitations in current CBAS in order to make them more practical for real world applications. Also, the paper discusses a new application for CBAS not requiring any training data either from intruders or from valid users.","","978-1-4244-8335-8;9781424483358","978-0-7695-4214-0;9780769542140","10.1109/HPCC.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581430","Authentication;Continuous Biometric;Impostor;Intruder;Security","","authorisation;behavioural sciences;biometrics (access control);computer crime","continuous biometric authentication;user behavioural characteristics;user profile","","1","","22","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4;9781467327084","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In any case, several security vulnerabilities have been spotted in virtually any version of the protocol rendering the integration of external protection mechanisms a necessity. In this context, the contribution of this paper is multifold. First, it gathers, categorizes, thoroughly evaluates the most popular attacks on 802.11 and analyzes their signatures. Second, it offers a publicly available dataset containing a rich blend of normal and attack traffic against 802.11 networks. A quite extensive first-hand evaluation of this dataset using several machine learning algorithms and data features is also provided. Given that to the best of our knowledge the literature lacks such a rich and well-tailored dataset, it is anticipated that the results of the work at hand will offer a solid basis for intrusion detection in the current as well as next-generation wireless networks.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2402161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041170","802.11;Attacks;Dataset;Intrusion Detection;Security;WiFi;attacks;dataset;intrusion detection;security","Authentication;Encryption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Protocols","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);next generation networks;wireless LAN","802.11 network;Wi-Fi;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithm;medium-range device connectivity;next-generation wireless network;public dataset empirical evaluation;short-range device connectivity;threat empirical evaluation","","2","","69","","2015-02-12","Firstquarter 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur.

The theoretical and experimental analysis took account of wind velocity and other environmental noise, as well as the fence construction. A discussion is presented of the theoretical analysis and the experimental results of the program. Commercial fence sensors were compared to sensitive accelerometers.

Relatively short binary receptors are used for primary detection, while the real valued detectors are used to resolve eventual doubts. Such a hybrid solution is much more economical in comparison with ldquopurerdquo approaches. The binary detectors are more faster than real-valued ones, what allows minimize computationally and timely complex operations on real values.

Since there is no central controller to determine the reliable & Secure communication paths in Mobile Adhoc Network, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue and they are forced to rely on the neighbor node, trust plays an important role that could improve the number of successful data transmission. Larger the number of trusted nodes, higher successful data communication process rates could be expected. In this paper, Denial of Service attack is applied in the network, evidences are collected to design intrusion detection engine for MANET Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Feature extraction and rule inductions are applied to find out the accuracy of detection engine by using support vector machine.

ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7;9781849199407","","10.1049/cp.2014.0975","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This paper presents an anomaly detection approach, which includes a transforming model and a classifier model. The transforming model converts every entry into a vector, and every value in vector is obtained by training extracted features in statistical techniques and Naive Bayes, which can analyze URI or URL without query in web logs and establish a unified normal standard for different websites. A big real-life dataset of about 50.1GB web logs has been used to verify the effectiveness of our approach, and the experimental results show that our approach can achieve detection rate over 98% and false alarm rate less than 1.5%.","","","","10.1109/CSCloud.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371496","URI analysis;anomaly detection;transforming model;web-based attack","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Entropy;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Probability;Uniform resource locators","Bayes methods;Web sites;cloud computing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Naive Bayes;URI;URL;Web log analysis;Web sites;Web-based attack mitigation;anomaly detection approach;big real-life dataset;classifier model;cloud environments;extracted feature training;false alarm rate;statistical techniques;transforming model;vector","","","","18","","","3-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","14","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","2161-5322;21615322","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4673-2433-5;9781467324335","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack).

"LEoNIDS: A Low-Latency and Energy-Efficient Network-Level Intrusion Detection System","N. Tsikoudis; A. Papadogiannakis; E. P.

While it started with data centers and battery-operated mobile devices, it has recently branched to core network devices such as routers. However, this emerging need for low-power system design has not been studied for security systems, which are becoming increasingly important today. Toward this direction, we aim to reduce the power consumption of network-level intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are used to improve the secure operation of modern computer networks. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to low-power system design, such as frequency scaling, lead to a disproportionate increase in packet processing and queuing times. In this paper, we show that this increase has a negative impact on the detection latency and impedes a timely reaction. To address this issue, we present a low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS (LEoNIDS): an architecture that resolves the energy-latency tradeoff by providing both low power consumption and low detection latency at the same time. The key idea is to identify the packets that are more likely to carry an attack and give them higher priority so as to achieve low attack detection latency. Our results indicate that LEoNIDS consumes power comparable to a state-of-the-art low-power design, while, at the same time, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster attack detection.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2369958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977945","Energy-Efficient Systems;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion detection systems;Low Latency;Low-Power design;Multi-Core Packet Processing;Network Security;Performance;energy-efficient systems;low latency;low-power design;multi-core packet processing;network security;performance","Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Program processors;Security;Time-frequency analysis","computer network security;energy conservation;low-power electronics;power aware computing;power consumption","LEoNIDS;battery-operated mobile devices;core network devices;data centers;frequency scaling;low attack detection latency;low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS;low-latency and energy-efficient network-level intrusion detection system;low-power system design;modern computer networks;packet processing;power consumption;queuing times;routers;secure operation;security systems","","0","","30","","2014-12-05","Jan.-March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Ensemble learning utilising feature pairings for intrusion detection","M. Milliken; Y. Bi; L. Galway; G. Hawe","School of Computing and Mathematics, Ulster University, Belfast, United Kingdom","2015 World Congress on Internet Security (WorldCIS)","20160218","2015","","","24","31","Network intrusions may illicitly retrieve data/information, or prevent legitimate access. Reliable detection of network intrusions is an important problem, misclassification of an intrusion is an issue in and of itself reducing overall accuracy of detection. A variety of potential methods exist to develop an improved system to perform classification more accurately. Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly. In particular, classification using the ensemble algorithm, StackingC, with F-Measure performance and derived Information Gain Ratio, as well as their subsequent correlation as a combined measure, is presented.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F-Measure performance;StackingC;data retrieval;ensemble algorithm;ensemble learning;feature pairings;feature selection;information gain ratio;information retrieval;misclassification;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;reliable detection","","","","20","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
