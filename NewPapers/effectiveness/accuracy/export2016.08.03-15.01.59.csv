This paper shows that this lack of state information requires an additional metric (The exchange timeout window) for detection of WLAN Denial of Service Probe Flood attacks. Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks. A parameter selection method is proposed which is shown to provide reliability and repeatability in attack detection in WLANs.

It involves eliminating redundant and irrelevant features from the dataset to get a subset of features, which performs as efficient as the complete set. The wrapper approach to the problem of feature selection is to use an induction algorithm to select the features. Most induction algorithms fail to handle large datasets. The obvious method that can be employed to handle large datasets is divide and conquer. This paper introduces a strategy for finding features from a collection of distributed subsets using the BLEM2 rule-based inductive learning program. Heurstics for determining proper number of subsets and proper subset size are proposed.

We consider all network packets before they reach to the end-user by extracting a certain number of features of internet worm from these packets. Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors. Our approach provides good results with detection rate over 99.6 percent and false alarm rate is close to zero with Random forest algorithm. In addition, our model can classify behaviors of DoS and Port Scan attacks with detection rate higher than 98 percent and false alarm rate equal to zero.","","978-1-4244-6986-4;9781424469864","978-89-88678-20-6;9788988678206","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484868","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","","10","","","11-13 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these methods couldn't obtain higher detection rates with lower false positive rates. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme to merge the two methods with multi-source information fusion technology. The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system.

Clusters are represented using extended cluster features that comprise of not only features related to the original features, but also features that describe the relationships between clusters. Each cluster is labeled by the user as anomaly or normal and then a decision tree is trained based on this information. The incoming new data is labeled according to the output of the decision tree. We show that this system achieves much better performance than an unsupervised anomaly detection system.

Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data.

"Darknet as a Source of Cyber Intelligence: Survey, Taxonomy, and Characterization","C. Fachkha; M.

In this paper, we present a survey on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities. Last but not least, our survey identifies specific darknet areas, such as IPv6 darknet, event monitoring, and game engine visualization methods that require a significantly greater amount of attention from the research community.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2497690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317717","Botnet;Cyber;Cyber Attacks;Darknet;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS);Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS);Intelligence;Probing;Security;Threats;Worms;botnet;cyber attacks;darknet;distributed denial of service (DDoS);distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS);intelligence;probing;security;threats;worms","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Sensors;Taxonomy","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;invasive software","Conficker worm;DRDoS amplification investigations;Honeyd;IPv6 darknet;Internet activities;Internet security community;Sality SIP scan botnet;computer worms;cyber attacks;cyber intelligence;cyber threat activities;cyberspace monitoring;darknet projects;darknet sensors;distributed reflection denial of service amplification investigations;event monitoring;game engine visualization methods;largest amplification attack;mobile-based VOIP technology;passive monitoring;scanning activities;spoofing activities;taxonomy;trap-based monitoring systems","","","","231","","2015-11-04","Secondquarter 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes.

Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time. To prove our concepts, we measured the processing speed for the developed system on the data generated using Active Directory tested and showed the efficiency of our approach for high-speed analysis of security events.","2379-5352;23795352","978-1-4673-7147-6;9781467371476","","10.1109/ISPDC.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165133","SAP HANA;in-memory;intrusion detection;machine learning;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Databases;Libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Security","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","SAP HANA;active directory;computational-heavy algorithms;data analysis;deep log message normalisation;high-speed security analytics;high-speed security event analysis;in-memory database;in-memory machine learning engine;integrated machine learning library;machine learning analysis;security information and event management systems","","1","","27","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A comparison of system call feature representations for insider threat detection","A. Liu; C. Martin; T. Hetherington; S. Matzner","Signal & Inf. Sci. Lab., Texas Univ. at Austin, TX, USA","Proceedings from the Sixth Annual IEEE SMC Information Assurance Workshop","20050815","2005","","","340","347","This paper investigates anomaly detection techniques that have been successful for detecting external threats and applies them to the insider threat problem. The insider threat involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the external threat involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495972","","Business;Computer vision;Data security;Government;Histograms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Testing","information systems;security of data","anomaly detection system;external threat detection;histograms;information access;information assurance;information dissemination;information systems;insider threat detection;intrusion detection system;outlier detection;sensitive information;system call feature representation;system call names;tamper resistance;trust;user privilege","","13","","18","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The KPCA was used to obtain the important characteristics of the intrusion data to eliminate the redundant features. Then the PSO was used to optimize the SVM parameters.

In this regard, various intrusion detection systems have been developed for using misuse detection and anomaly detection methodologies. These systems try to improve detection rates of variation in attack types and reduce the false positive rate. In this paper, a new intrusion detection method has been introduced using MinMax K-means clustering algorithm, which overcomes the shortage of sensitivity to initial centers in K-means algorithm, and increases the quality of clustering. The experiments on the NSL-KDD data set indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than that based on K-means clustering algorithm. Also, the method has higher detection rate and lower false positive detection rate.","","978-1-4799-5358-5;9781479953585","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000814","MinMax K-means;anomaly detection;clustering algorithm;intrusion detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training;Training data","Internet;computer network security;minimax techniques;pattern clustering","Internet;MinMax K-means clustering algorithm quality;NSL-KDD data set;anomaly detection method;computer network attack;computer network security;intrusion detection method;misuse detection method","","0","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model incorporates four dimensions: Information System Security Life Cycle, Information Taxonomy, Security Goals and Security Countermeasures. In addition to the descriptive knowledge, the RMIAS embeds the methodological knowledge.

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","","","","10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982526","Intrusion Detection;SVM and Bat Algorithm","Accuracy;Barium;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines","feature selection;feedforward neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","Bat algorithm;NIDS model;NSL-KDD data;PSO-SVM;feature selection;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection systems;optimization;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","27","","","17-19 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Botnet Detection System Based on Neural Networks","A. Nogueira; P. Salvador; F.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0;9781424472710","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
