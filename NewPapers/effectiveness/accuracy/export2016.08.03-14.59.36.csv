The traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) generally has the following disadvantages: the first one is that it could not detect the new type attacks even the variation of existed attacks; the second one is the detection time is so long that the real-time capability of the system is low. In this paper we proposed a new model based on LLE and BVM to solve the problems mentioned above. This model is different from traditional IDS, we use BVM classifier to differentiate the normal and abnormal attacks, and we added a pre-process module before the classifier. In the pre-process module, we use LLE to extract the main features of the intrusion data, which is the main part of the pre-process module, and then the principal components of the data are used as input of BVM classifier that differentiates the normal and abnormal actions. Applying this proposed system to KDDCUP99 data, experimental results clearly illustrates that this model has a remarkable performance in detecting both existed instruction and new ones.","2162-5476;21625476","978-1-4244-8104-0;9781424481040","978-1-4244-8106-4;9781424481064","10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636736","BVM;IDS;LLE;component;feature extraction","Databases;Probes","Internet;computer network security;pattern classification","BVM classifier;Internet;KDDCUP99 data;LLE;intrusion detection system;network attacks;network security","","0","","13","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, blacklists must be updated because malicious URLs tend to be short-lived and their sub strings may be partially mutated to avoid blacklisting. Due to these characteristics, it can be assumed that unknown malicious URLs exist in the neighborhood of known malicious URLs, created by the same adversary. We propose an effective blacklist URL generation method. We try to discover the URLs in the neighborhood of a malicious URL by using a search engine. Those suspicious neighborhoods around malicious URLs require further investigation to determine their blacklisting candidacy.

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments.

Most of the current intrusion detection systems work in isolation to detect these attacks. Past research has shown that collaboration between these networks to share suspicious information is an effective way to detect intrusion. However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure. We propose a peer-to-peer approach for collaborative intrusion detection to address these challenges. Our solution proposes secure data sharing between participants from different organizations using a content based peer-to-peer publish/subscribe mechanism. The proposed scheme improves scalability, while avoiding a central point of failure.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters.

This paper proposes a new framework to detect anomalies and to provide early alerts for flooding attacks in backbone networks.

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate.

One cannot eliminate missing values in medical records. The reason may be because some tests may not been conducted as they are cost effective, values missed when conducting clinical trials, values may not have been recorded to name some of the reasons. Data mining researchers have been proposing various approaches to find and impute missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation approach for fixing missing values. The approach is based on clustering concept and aims at dimensionality reduction of the records. This serves the need to use the same records of lower dimension to be used for clustering and classification of medical records to arrive at accurate decision prediction. The case study discussed shows that the missing values can be fixed and imputed efficiently by achieving dimensionality reduction. The proposed approach for imputation also achieved dimensionality reduction to perform efficient prediction of missing values.","","978-1-4799-7848-9;9781479978489","","10.1109/ICCIC.2015.7435816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435816","cluster;dimensionality reduction;imputation;medical records;missing values;nearest neighbor;prediction","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Conferences;Data mining;Diseases;Prediction algorithms","data mining;medical administrative data processing;pattern classification;pattern clustering","clinical trials;clustering concept;data mining researcher;decision prediction;dimensionality reduction;hidden knowledge extraction;medical dataset mining;medical record classification;medical records;missing attribute value imputation","","","","20","","","10-12 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed an adaptive ensemble classifier for concept drifting stream classification which focuses on both the above two aspects called AEC. Our AEC includes two stages: the online stage and the offline stage, and three phases: classifier updating, ensemble classifiers reconstruction and component classifier subset selection for final decision. We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination of which may yield better accuracy to make classification. Experiment justifies the superiority of our model in both accuracy and sensitivity in the concept drifting environment.","","978-1-4244-2765-9;9781424427659","","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938631","","Bagging;Buffer storage;Computers;Content addressable storage;Decision making;Decision trees;History;Internet;Intrusion detection;Training data","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","adaptive ensemble classifier;concept drifting stream classification;ensemble reconstruction;incremental learner;naive Bayes classifier;online bagging classification","","1","","15","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","13","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057","Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps","Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps","Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume","","1","","24","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various approaches to multi- objective optimisation (Darwin, Lamarck Baldwin, etc.) are compared and contrasted in their ability to generate architectures meeting various constraints. We also present an assessment of a proposed architecture with reference to four different packet processing roles. The merits of an island clocking scheme versus a common clocking scheme are also discussed. Our paper highlights the flexibility that this framework bestows on the designer, along with the potential to achieve cost savings and performance improvement.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579528","design space exploration;evolutionary approaches;object oriented","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Costs;Design engineering;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Power engineering and energy;Process design;Proposals;Space exploration","evolutionary computation;integrated circuit design;logic design;microprocessor chips;object-oriented methods","Intel IXP1200 network processor;common clocking scheme;competitive optimisation;cost analysis;design space exploration;island clocking scheme;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimisation;multiprocessor system;network processor design framework;object oriented techniques","","0","","44","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.","","978-1-4673-8050-8;9781467380508","","10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325234","DDoS Attacks;Flow Base IP Traceback;Network Security;Probabilistic Flow Marking","Computer crime;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Network interfaces;Probabilistic logic","Internet;computer network security","CAIDA archives;IP traceback scheme;IP traceback schemes;Internet;NAT;PFM;anonymous flooding attacks;distributed-denial-of-service attacks;network address translation;probabilistic flow marking;proxy device;security issues;source IP address spoofing;spoofed source IP addresses","","","","20","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. In this paper, we have implemented I-Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and I- PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm to detect time interval denial of service (DoS) attack sequences on network traffic data of KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners.

This includes the challenges in designing intelligent engineering systems to reduce false positives and increases detection capability of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The high percentage of alerts and false positives generated by IDSs are among the significant problems. We present intelligent systems architecture and integration, including risk management and validation for reduction of false positives and infrastructure protection using a novel approach using adaptive responses from firewall packet filters in what we call, network quarantine channels (NQC). This includes risk assessments and design of integrated virtual private networks (VPNs) and strategic controls via packet filters, which collaborate with the NQC to reply to suspicious hosts, and them deny access to sensitive data servers in the infrastructure. The firewall packet filters provide effective intelligent responses by to granting access to the normal packets and denying malicious traffic access to the network, after the identity of the connections are verified through the statistical analysis in the NQC. These effective strategies reduce false positives and increases detection capability of the IDS. The intelligent systems at the system-of-systems level include systems modeling and simulation, systems engineering education, training, quality management for intrusion detection, computer security and disaster response. The validation includes statistical analysis and modeling of systems integration for handling large-scale and complex systems in emerging commercial networks.

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the possible approaches to improve the current situation, expert systems have been advocated to be an important one. Typical tasks that such expert systems attempt to achieve include finding system vulnerabilities and detecting malicious behaviour of users. We extend our intrusion detection system ASAX with a deductive subsystem that allows us to assess the security level of a software configuration on a real time basis. By coupling the two subsystems-intrusion detection and configuration analysis-we moreover achieve a better tuning of the intrusion detection since the system has only to enable intrusion detection rules that are specifically required by the current state of the configuration.

Detection-based mechanisms are considered to be the second defense line against attacks when the traditional prevention based mechanisms failed to detect them. Different intrusion detection schemes have been introduced (e.g. rule based, statistical based...etc). Rule-based intrusion detection schemes are considered to be the fast and simple schemes that are suitable for the demand of WSN. However, these schemes are more specific to some kinds of attacks and cannot be generalized. In addition, these schemes cannot detect the unknown attacks that are not included in their rule base.

The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility.

Based on the former all possible intruding paths and state transformation can be illustrated, and based on the latter really happening threats and intruding path are described. Then a threat awareness algorithm is presented based on the above model. With this algorithm, various kinds of invalid threats are filtered, current valid threats are obtained by correlating dynamic alarms with static attack scenario.

Climatic factors are important in influencing the incidence of dengue. It is important to determine the relationships between climatic factors and disease incidence trends, which would be helpful for relevant environment and health agencies in planning appropriate pre-emptive control measures. Climatic factors and dengue case records vary over time. It is therefore difficult to justify the time-lag when a climatic factor affects the mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito loops. In this paper, we propose to use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for analyzing the time- series dengue data and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the time-lags and subset of climatic factors as effective factors influencing the spread of dengue. It is shown that the proposed model is able to detect important climatic factors and their time-lags which affect the disease, and the GA-based SVM classifiers could improve the classification accuracy significantly.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4244-1339-3;9781424413393","978-1-4244-1340-9;9781424413409","10.1109/CEC.2007.4424617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4424617","","Blood;Data analysis;Diseases;Genetic algorithms;Humans;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Temperature dependence;Temperature distribution;Vaccines","climatology;diseases;genetic algorithms;health care;medical computing;support vector machines;time series","SVM classifier;climatic factors;dengue;disease incidence trend;genetic algorithm;health threat;human-to-mosquito loop;infectious disease data analysis;mosquito-to-human loop;support vector machine;time-series","","0","","28","","","25-28 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The C-Worm has the capability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time, thereby camouflaging its propagation from existing worm detection systems. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","978-1-4673-6617-5;9781467366175","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead.

It is promising to protect private data and to improve the system security by leveraging the isolation attribute of virtual machine (VM). The isolation attribute of VM is provided by Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that runs in higher priority than guest OSes. If the critical components are isolated in VMs,access control can be enforced or attestation can be made when the subject is accessing via VMs. In this way, VMs can improve the security level of critical components such as OS, kernel, data, and applications. For computer system security, VMs can be used to detect malware intrusions and to protect critical components, which can be implemented by integrating detection or protection mechanism in either VMM or VMs. Authentication is required to create trustful VMs. This paper surveys technologies related of using virtual machines to enhance system security.","1949-131X;1949131X","978-0-7695-3818-1;9780769538181","","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5328990","Critical component;Isolation;Security;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Monitor","Application software;Computer applications;Data security;Kernel;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","invasive software;virtual machines","access control;authentication;computer system security;critical components;guest OS;malware intrusions;virtual machine monitor","","1","6","48","","","21-22 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Virtual intrusion detection systems in the cloud","P.

In this paper we focus on a virtual intrusion detection system (V-IDS). We present a new architecture that uses the basic principles of cloud computing, virtualization, and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane and applies them to intrusion detection systems, in order to protect cloud networks characterized by a constantly changing underlying infrastructure and physical topology. Our research is not focused on new algorithms or products capable of solving the security problem in cloud networks: our goal is to define a process and a novel architecture that minimizes the security risk in distributed networks, implementing the principle that network security and reliability is not a product, but a well defined process. On the basis of the defined architecture we have implemented a prototype cloud-based IDS that validates our thesis. The prototype is realized though the integration of two open source technologies: OpenNebula and Dynamic Resource Allocation via GMPLS Optical Networks (DRAGON).  2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.21562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6770191","","","","","","0","","","","","Dec. 2012","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"
