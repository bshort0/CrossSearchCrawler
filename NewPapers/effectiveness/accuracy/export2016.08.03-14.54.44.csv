Using statistical methods to analyze intrusion logs in order to present evidentiary values in court are often refuted as baseless and inadmissible evidences which is not considering the input spent. These spendings is to generate the reports no matter they are well-grounded evidences or not. Thus, this paper presents the Scenario Reconstruction Method combines the Viterbi algorithm, the most likely sequence of Meta evidence which replaces the Meta evidence was acquired. With suspected evidence, thus obtaining the chain of evidence. However, the Viterbi algorithm parameters is derived from the Baum-Welch (B-W) algorithm, and the B-W algorithm is easy to fall into local optima solution. While an Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) is used to estimate parameters of the Hidden Markov model (HMM), where Chromosome coding method and genetic operation mode are designed. The experimental results show that, this method can accurately reproduce the crime scene of network intrusion, compared with the network forensic evidence fusion method which is based on the HMM. The method has been applied to forensics system, and has obtained good result.","","978-1-4673-8301-1;9781467383011","","10.1109/ITME.2015.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429199","computer forensics;evidence fusion;genetic Algorithm;hidden Markov models","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood decoding;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;digital forensics;genetic algorithms;hidden Markov models","AGA;B-W algorithm;Baum-Welch algorithm;HMM;Meta evidence sequence;Viterbi algorithm parameters;adaptive genetic algorithm;chromosome coding method;crime scene reproduction;genetic operation mode;hidden Markov models;intrusion log analysis;local optima solution;network forensic scenario reconstruction method;network intrusion;statistical methods","","","","13","","","13-15 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth is mostly because of the popularity of the shared content and the great enhancement in the P2P protocol since it first came out with Napster. The shared files are generally both large and copyrighted. Motivated by the problems of UlakNet with the P2P traffic, we propose a novel method for P2P traffic-detection in the network backbone in this paper. Observing the similarity between detecting traffic that belongs to a specific protocol and detecting an intrusion in a computer system, we adopt an intrusion detection system (IDS) technique to detect P2P traffic. Our method is a passive detection procedure that uses traffic flows gathered from border routers. Hence, it is scalable and does not have the problems of other approaches that rely on packet pay load data or transport layer ports","","1-4244-0491-6;1424404916","","10.1109/ISCN.2006.1662521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662521","Bayesian Networks;P2P;intrusion detection systems;peer-to-peer;traffic characterization","Application software;Bandwidth;Copyright protection;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Spine;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","38","","","16-18 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4673-1565-4;9781467315654","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is based on constant characteristics of a common, 2-frame interlaced video signal, yet results presented in this paper show its applicability to highly compressed, noisy image sequences as well. In general, our approach uses a computationally low-cost solution to define the area of interest for tracking of multiple, moving objects. Despite its simplicity, it compares very well to existing approaches due to its robustness towards environmental changes. To demonstrate this, we present results of processing a sequence of JPEG-compressed monocular images of a parking lot in order to track pedestrians, cars and bicycles. Despite a high level of noise and changing lighting conditions, the algorithm successfully segments a moving object and tracks its position along a trajectory.","","0-7695-2319-6;0769523196","","10.1109/CRV.2005.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443140","Interlace Filter;Motion Detection;Motion Tracking;Surveillance","Computer vision;Filters;Image coding;Image sequences;Motion detection;Motion estimation;Robustness;Tracking;Video compression;Working environment noise","computer vision;filtering theory;image sequences;motion estimation;target tracking;tracking filters;video signal processing","2-frame interlaced video signal;JPEG-compressed monocular images;computer vision systems;high performance low-level filter;interlace filter;motion tracking;multiple moving object tracking;noisy image sequences;people tracking;robust motion detection;robust motion estimation;surveillance","","4","","10","","","9-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6449406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","5","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Authorized but malicious transactions can make a database useless by impairing its integrity and availability. The paper presents the design of a real-time data attack isolation system, denoted DAIS. DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hyperellipsoidal clusters toward maximum intracluster similarity and minimum intercluster similarity are generated from training data sets. The novelty of the technique lies in the fact that the parameters needed to construct higher order data models in general multivariate Gaussian functions are incrementally derived from the data sets using accretive processes. The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network. One significant advantage of this is its ability to detect individual anomaly types that are hard to detect with other anomaly-detection schemes.

This includes better automated extraction of rules parameters as well as bootstrap aggregation for generalization. Experimental results show that such optimization gives a smaller number of rules, while the accuracy increases in comparison to existing approaches. In particular, it showed an accuracy of 98% when using only 39 rules. In our research we contribute to forensics science by increasing awareness and bringing more comprehensive fuzzy rules. During the last decade many cases related to network forensics resulted in data that can be related to Big Data due to its complexity.

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

Most existing works focus on actively detecting malicious nodes by verifying signal correlation or behavior consistency. It may not work well in large-scale social networks since the number of users is extremely large and the difference between normal users and malicious users is inconspicuous. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of users to perform the detection task. We design incentive mechanisms to encourage the participation of users under two scenarios: full information and partial information. In full information scenario, we design a specific incentive scheme for users according to their preferences, which can provide the desirable detection result and minimize overall cost. In partial information scenario, assuming that we only have statistical information about users, we first transform the incentive mechanism design to an optimization problem, and then design the optimal incentive scheme under different system parameters by solving the optimization problem. We perform extensive simulations to validate the analysis and demonstrate the impact of system factors on the overall cost.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2560518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7462258","crowdsourcing;largescale networks.;malicious users detection","Correlation;Crowdsourcing;Incentive schemes;Internet of things;Optimization;Sensors;Social network services","","","","","","","","2016-04-28","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Database firewalls take defense deep into the organization by providing full syntax control and audit of the SQL API stream before it reaches the database, and enforcing content-driven access to database. This paper proposes a layered reference model for database firewalls by enhancing the capability of COAST Laboratorys model. It separates a database firewall into three layers (network layer, schematic layer and semantic layer) according to the knowledge, computation target, and the control granularity of each layer.

An anomaly dete-ction method based on K-means clustering is introduced to detect and filter request flooding attacks and asymmetric attacks. To defend against session-flooding attacks, we propose an encouragement model that uses client's session rate as currency. Detection model drops suspicious sessions, while currency model encourages more legitimate sessions. By collaboration of these two models, normal clients could gain higher service rate and lower delay of response time.","","978-0-7695-2858-9;9780769528589","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438303","","Application software;Business;Computer crime;Delay effects;Floods;Military computing;Pressing;Protocols;Security;Telecommunication traffic","information filters;security of data","DOW;K-means clustering;anomaly detection method;application layer DDoS attacks;asymmetric attacks;attacks layer-7 session flooding attacks;defense and offense wall;filter request flooding attacks;offense mechanism","","8","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured. This study focuses on building a product-like security gateway and on evaluating its performance.

It first proposes an unsupervised feature selection algorithm, which is an enhancement over the Laplacian score method, named an Extended Laplacian score, EL in short. Specifically, two main phases are involved in EL to complete the selection procedures. In the first phase, the Laplacian score algorithm is applied to select the features that have the best locality preserving power. In the second phase, EL proposes a Redundancy Penalization (RP) technique based on mutual information to eliminate the redundancy among the selected features. This technique is an enhancement over Battiti's MIFS. It does not require a user-defined parameter such as beta to complete the selection processes of the candidate feature set as it is required in MIFS. After tackling the feature selection problem, the final selected subset is then used to build an Intrusion Detection System. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed detection system are evaluated using three well-known intrusion detection datasets: KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ dataset. The evaluation results confirm that our feature selection approach performs better than the Laplacian score method in terms of classification accuracy.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345295","Intrusion detection system;Mutual information;Supervised feature selection;Unsupervised feature selection","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Laplace equations;Mutual information;Random variables;Redundancy;Yttrium","feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","EL;KDD Cup 99;Kyoto 2006+ dataset;Laplacian score algorithm;NSL-KDD;RP technique;data classification;extended Laplacian score method;intrusion detection system;locality preserving power;redundancy penalization;unsupervised feature selection algorithm","","","","25","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms.

Changes to satisfy telecommunication needs within the technical community have surfaced gradually through the efforts of international computer standards organizations, technical panels, and guidance committees. The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another example of a security ap- - pliance.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","1","","56","","2015-02-10","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted).

The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.","","978-1-4673-0161-9;9781467301619","978-1-4673-0162-6;9781467301626","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309308","agent;control;resilient system","Computer security;Control systems;Fault detection;Process control;Sensor phenomena and characterization","multi-agent systems","ReCoSEA;complex systems;coordination layer;cyber intrusion;data analysis;execution layer;faulty analysis;malignant actors;management layer;multiagent design;resilient control system execution agent","","7","","26","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them.

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels.

IEEE Symposium on","20090515","2009","","","13","18","Application features such as port numbers are used by network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) to detect attacks coming from networks. System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an adaptive NIDS using data mining technology is developed. Data mining approaches are used to accurately capture the actual behavior of network traffic, and portfolio mined is useful for differentiating normal and attack traffics. On the other hand, most of the current researches are using only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability on detecting new types of attack as well as a higher tolerant to fluctuations were shown. The experimental results showed that the frequent patterns mined from the audit data could be used as reliable agents, which outperformed from traditional signature-based NIDS.","","0-7695-2316-1;0769523161","","10.1109/ICITA.2005.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1488784","","Association rules;Computer network reliability;Computer security;Data mining;Engines;Fluctuations;Intrusion detection;Portfolios;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;data mining;software agents;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","agent-based network intrusion detection system;attack detection;data mining;network traffic","","10","","15","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The set of labelled Net Flow records collecting traffic statistics is a very useful source of decision rules that classify the records. These rules can be created automatically using machine learning techniques. However, the classifiers learned on such records may recognise only past events and cannot recognise current events, because not all data were collected. A deterministic finite automaton is a classifier that can recognise events online. However, the automaton is hard to project in case of complex issues. The paper proposes how to convert a decision tree into a deterministic finite automaton. The decision tree learns how to recognise threats using the collected data. Consequently, the set of decision rules is transformed into a finite automaton that can detect events before the full complement of data is collected. The method is limited to small trees, but can solve real problems. As an example, the detection of the TCP SYN flood attack is presented. For that example, the created automaton has the same high accuracy ratio as the decision tree, but can take decisions over three times faster.","","978-1-4799-7560-0;9781479975600","","10.1109/SSCI.2015.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7376594","","Automata;Computational intelligence;Decision trees;Detectors;Floods;Hardware;Learning automata","decision trees;finite automata","TCP SYN flood attack detection;decision rules;decision tree;deterministic finite automaton;high accuracy online SYN flood detection;threat recognition","","","","18","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to detect these malicious activities, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in corporate networks. IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation. In this paper, we present commonly used alert correlation approaches and highlight their advantages and disadvantages from various perspectives.

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.","","1-4244-0800-8;1424408008","1-4244-0801-6;1424408016","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146353","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Entropy;Information systems;Intrusion detection;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;security of data;telecommunication security","feature selection;lightweight intrusion detection model;maximum entropy model;network intrusion detection system","","3","","8","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these systems expose virtualized resources of different types and sizes. As instances share the same physical host to increase utilization, they contend on hardware resources, e.g., last-level cache, making them vulnerable to side-channel attacks from co-scheduled applications. In this work we show that using data mining techniques can help an adversarial user of the cloud determine the nature and characteristics of co-scheduled applications and negatively impact their performance through targeted contention injections. We design Bolt, a simple runtime that extracts the sensitivity of co-scheduled applications to various types of interference and uses this signal to determine the type of these applications by applying a set of data mining techniques. We validate the accuracy of Bolt on a 39-server cluster. Bolt correctly identifies the type and characteristics of 81% out of 108 victim applications, and constructs specialized contention signals that degrade their performance. We also use Bolt to find the most commonly-run applications on EC2. We hope that underlining such security vulnerabilities in modern cloud facilities will encourage cloud providers to introduce stronger resource isolation primitives in their systems.","1556-6056;15566056","","","10.1109/LCA.2015.2461215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167661","Scheduling and task partitioning;Security and privacy protection;Super (very large) computers","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Data mining;Degradation;Fasteners;Interference;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-07-27","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

OppNets exploit the characteristics of the human social, such as similarities, daily routines, mobility patterns and interests to perform the message routing and data sharing. Packet dropping attack is one of the hardest attacks in Opportunistic Networks as both the source nodes and the destination nodes have no knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a new malicious nodes detection technique against packet faking attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and instead of them injects new fake packets. We have called this novel attack in our previous works a packet faking attack. Each node in Opportunistic Networks can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, hash chain techniques. In our hash chain based defense techniques we have two phases. The first phases is to detect the attack, and the second phases is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature.

Annual","20081222","2008","","","279","288","An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a crucial element of a network security posture. One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3447-3;9780769534473","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection.

However, the trustworthiness of these data is crucial as false information can heavily affect the performance of applications. Hence, the devising of mechanisms that reassure the integrity of the exchanged data is of utmost importance. In this article we investigate how tweaked information originating from malicious nodes can affect the performance of a real time eco-routing mechanism that uses Dedicated Short Ranged Communications (DSRC), namely Erou Ve. We improve the routing decision mechanism of the original algorithm and also develop and evaluate defense mechanisms that exploit vehicular communications in order to filter out tweaked data.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.","","","","10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering","Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining","","0","","24","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073-0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559609","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

However, the storage required for traffic traces has greatly expanded due to increasing network speeds. In this paper, we selectively cap the packet payload to reduce write speed and storage requirements on hard drives and further reduce the computational burden of packet analysis. The proposed techniques take advantage of most packet payloads being useless for analysis purposes, because they are either encrypted or in a proprietary application non-readable format. Conversely, non-ASCII packets from well-known protocols and protocols with some ASCII data are fully captured as they may be potentially useful for network analysis. We have named this approach as selective capping, and we have implemented and integrated it into a high-speed network driver and a software module at user level, to make its operation more transparent and faster to upper layer applications. The results are promising, and selective capping achieves multi-Gb/s rates by exploiting low-level hardware and software techniques to meet the fastest network rates.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2559198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460894","Interleaved ASCII;Packet Storage;Packet storage;Selective Capping;Traffic capture;interleaved ASCII;selective capping;traffic capture","Cryptography;Hard disks;Internet;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network management;telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection;hard drive;high-speed network driver;network analyst;network manager;nonASCII packets;packet analysis;packet payload selective capping;software module;traffic behavior","","","","25","","2016-04-27","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining to secure a web server from network scanners.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","24","3","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.","0197-7385;01977385","978-1-4244-4332-1;9781424443321","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320","","Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar","sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication","high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes","","0","","1","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction.

As control systems become increasingly complex, the number of inputs and outputs increase. Therefore, in order to maintain sufficient levels of state-awareness, a robust system state monitoring must be implemented that correctly identifies system behavior even when one or more sensors are faulty. Furthermore, as intelligent cyber adversaries become more capable, incorrect values may be fed to the operators. To address these needs, this paper proposes a fuzzyneural data fusion engine (FN-DFE) for resilient state-awareness of control systems. The designed FN-DFE is composed of a three-layered system consisting of: 1) traditional threshold based alarms; 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing fuzzy logic system; and 3) artificial neural network-based system modeling and prediction. The improved control system stateawareness is achieved via fusing input data from multiple sources and combining them into robust anomaly indicators. In addition, the neural network-based signal predictions are used to augment the resiliency of the system and provide coherent state-awareness despite temporary unavailability of sensory data. The proposed system was integrated and tested with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory's hybrid energy system facility known as HYTEST. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed FNDFE provides timely plant performance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. It was shown that the system is capable of identifying intrusive behavior significantly earlier than conventional threshold-based alarm systems.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823672","Artificial neural networks;data fusion;fuzzy logic systems;resilient control systems;state-awareness","Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Robustness;Sensor systems;Vectors","control engineering computing;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;sensor fusion","FN-DFE engine;HYTEST facility;Idaho National Laboratory;anomalous behavior detector;artificial neural network-based system;control system state-awareness;control systems;critical infrastructure;energy production system;enhanced resilient state-awareness;fuzzy-neural data fusion engine;hybrid energy systems;industrial system;intelligent cyber adversaries;neural network-based signal predictions;self-organizing fuzzy logic system;system modeling;system prediction;system state monitoring;threshold based alarms;threshold-based alarm systems","","5","","41","","2014-05-30","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, AID techniques suffer from higher false alarm rate compared to signature-based intrusion detection techniques. In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We will try to present some key anomaly detection methods applicable in the data mining process. Some methods are existing techniques as the DBSCAN algorithm and some have just been presented to the public recently and could be the answer to future anomaly detection development. One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm. In our experiments we pursued to compare the performance of the normal DBSCAN algorithm with the performance of the hybrid one. Our results indicate that the hybrid method is more accurate in terms of detecting anomalies and far superior in terms of speed than the normal DBSCAN algorithm.","","978-1-4244-9108-7;9781424491087","","10.1109/SACI.2011.5872976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872976","Anomaly detection;clustering","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency","data mining;security of data","DBSCAN algorithm;anomaly detection methods;data mining process;data sets;filtering-and-refinement method","","0","","17","","","19-21 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
