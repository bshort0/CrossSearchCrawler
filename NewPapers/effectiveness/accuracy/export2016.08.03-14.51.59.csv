Accordingly, we propose a mathematical procedure that uses statistical and fuzzy logic techniques to rank the participation of individual features into the detection process.

Hence, several data protection tools and techniques have been presented to enhance the reliability in this emerging technology. One of the most challenging issues in this area is classification of stored data to improve the efficiency of data protection procedure and reduce energy consumption by eliminating un-necessary processes. Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data. The proposed classification index was evaluated by functionality and security parameters. In overall, the results show that the suggested index has considerable benefits in the process of data classification in cloud computing environments.","","978-1-4799-6105-4;9781479961054","","10.1109/SPC.2014.7086229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086229","Cloud Computing;Cloud Servers;Data Classification;Data Protection;Security","Availability;Cloud computing;Indexes;Process control;Security;Servers","cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy","VDCI;cloud computing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;data privacy;data protection;data security;energy consumption;variable data classification index","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0;9780769533360","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay. Hence, the success of our schemes of attestation does not depend on the accurate measurement of the execution time, which is the main drawback of previously proposed wireless sensor network attestation schemes.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425280","","Costs;Data security;Filling;Hardware;Information security;Laboratories;Protection;Time measurement;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;security of data;wireless sensor networks","WSN;channel collision;communication protocols;execution time;memory noise filling;network delay;post deployment noise filling;predeployment noise filling;sensor nodes;software-based remote code attestation;wireless sensor network","","3","","22","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its  backbone in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for WSN only focus attention on a specified routing protocol, which lacks universality and flexibility. To solve the problem of multi-protocol intrusion detection, this paper proposes a universal method: MPOID (Multi-Protocol Oriented Intrusion Detection). Our work can generate all the attack types for any routing protocol of WSN, furthermore, part of which can be detected with the automatically generated rules accurately. In this work, we formalize the routing protocol with the Process Algebra for Wireless Mesh Networks (AWN) language, and then classify all the potential attacks into four categories according to four original purposes. Beginning from the original purpose, we can generate all the attack targets, attack traces and attack types. What's more, if the protocol process do not use local variables in the key variable assignment, we can also generatethe detection rules for this attack type. Our case study of ADOV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol shows that our method generated all types of attacks, which outperforms other work. Our further theoretical analysis verifies that our detection rules could detect the corresponding attack types as we claimed. In conclusion, the MPOID method could be used as a flexible and universal tool to analyze and detect attack types for multi-protocol in WSN effectively.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336382","AWN;attack analysis;intrusion detection;multi-protocol;wireless sensor networks","Algebra;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Skeleton;Wireless sensor networks","process algebra;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ADOV protocol;IDS;MPOID;WSN;ad hoc on-demand distance vector protocol;diverse routing protocol;dynamic network topology;key variable assignment;multiprotocol oriented intrusion detection method;process algebra;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor network","","","","30","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first propose rule organized optimal matching (ROOM),which splits the identification rules into several fields and elaborately organizes the matching order of the fields. Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set). Based on ROOM, wefurther propose MP-ROOM, which is extended to well support the rules cross multiple protocol data units (PDUs) fortraffic identification. In addition, we implement a prototype system including MP-ROOM and related work for evaluations.The evaluations show very promising results: 1.5 ~71.3 times throughput improvement is obtained by MP-ROOM inthe real system with less than 300-MB memory consumption.

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security.","","978-1-4577-0855-8;9781457708558","","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990290","","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Transportation","particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines;transportation","KDD dataset;improved SVM model;intrusion detection;kernel principal component analysis;particle swarm optimization;support vector machine;transportation information security systems","","3","","8","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5;9781424481835","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a novel approach for detecting the SQL Injection attacks by applying TD machine learning technique. In this approach first the SQL query is compared with KB and if the query matches KB then it is a genuine query and database access is given. But in case of SQLIA queries, they are subjected to tokenization and then SQL query analysis is performed. A model based RL using TD learning is developed to distinguish between genuine & SQLIA queries.

Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class.

Every day new kind of attacks are being faced by industries. Hence intrusion detection system are playing vital role for computer security. The most effective method used to solve problem of IDS is machine learning. Getting labeled data does not only require more time but it is also expensive.

Liu","Microsoft Corporation, Mountain View","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","2","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset.

Rapid and infrastructure-less deployment in emergency and military situations make these networks unique. However, certain inherently vulnerable characteristics lead to security concerns, which can prove especially damaging in sensitive situations like military operations. Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme and detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While considerable attention has been given to data mining for intrusion detection in wired networks, limited focus has been devoted to data mining for intrusion detection in wireless networks. This study presents a clustering approach with tracers and expert analysis for intrusion detection in a real-world wireless network. Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and promise of the proposed approach, laying the groundwork for a clustering-based framework for intrusion detection in wireless computer networks.","","0-7695-2495-8;0769524958","","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607440","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;expert systems;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless networks;clustering techniques;data mining;distance-based heuristic measure;expert analysis;intrusion detection;label clusters;network traffic metrics;wireless computer network;wireless network security","","5","","5","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation.

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate.

We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data.

The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules are more effective because the generalization ability of NeuroC4.5 decision trees is better than that of C4.5 decision trees.

This paper explores the relationship between reliability engineering and security engineering for software products. Our work has indicated that designing for reliability and designing for security share many common ideas and, more importantly, techniques that can be leveraged in product development. Security failures are one aspect of product dependability, and while security failures are qualitatively different from other reliability failures in some ways, the two classes of failures have a great deal in common. International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.805 suggests that availability has a specific meaning for security, namely, that it ensures that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications due to events impacting the network. This definition is very similar to the definition of availability that reliability engineers use in describing functionality. This paper explores the similarities and differences in approaches taken within the communications domain for reliability and security. The three areas that are discussed are terminology, requirements, and common techniques.  2007 Alcatel-Lucent.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6769676","","","","","","0","","","","","Fall 2007","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"
"Preventing Unwanted Social Inferences with Classification Tree Analysis","S. Motahari; S. Ziavras; Q.

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.","1082-3409;10823409","978-1-4244-5619-2;9781424456192","978-0-7695-3920-1;9780769539201","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617","","Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services","decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis","Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy","","2","","29","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection is fast becoming a key element of intrusion detection systems, in which perturbations from normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Accurately detecting such anomalies has become an important problem for the network community. We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","1530-1346;15301346","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","1","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-2676-8;9781424426768","978-1-4244-2677-5;9781424426775","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs, as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures).Many studies report that IDSs, including signature-based network IDSs, have problems to accurately identify attacks. One possible reason that we observed in our past work, and that is worth investigating further, is that several signatures (i.e., several alarms) can be triggered on the same group of packets, a situation we coined overlapping signatures. This paper presents a technique to precisely and systemat ically quantify the signature overlapping problem of an IDS signature database. The solution we describe is based on set theory and finite state automaton theory, and we experiment with our technique on one widely-used and maintained IDS. Results show that our approach is effective at systematically quantifying the overlap problem in one IDS signature database, and can be potentially used on other IDSs.","1530-0889;15300889","978-1-4244-9232-9;9781424492329","978-1-4244-9231-2;9781424492312","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958211","Automaton Theory;Intrusion Detection Signature;Set Theory","Automata;Databases;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Set theory;Systematics","authorisation;digital signatures;finite state machines;set theory","anti-virus systems;computer networks;finite state automaton theory;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;set theory;signature overlaps;signature-based network IDS","","2","","18","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This may be due to improper deployment of the security measures, environmental hazards or to the fact that the assumptions under which the security requirements have been specified have become invalid. As such, this paper proposes an approach (supported by a system) which will complement security requirements engineering methodologies by gathering continuous evidence to inform on whether the security requirements elucidated during system development stage have been correctly implemented and as such, they can be relied upon to effectively protect system assets at runtime.

Hence several algorithms have been developed to extract the most relevant set of features that contribute to the accurate classification of records. The selected features should result in the least misclassification rate.

However, due to the nature of wireless networks that use shared medium for communications it needs more security features as its wired counterpart. Attackers can use proper devices and techniques to pull signals from the air and gain access to the unprotected wireless networks from anywhere in range of wireless network which receive wireless signals. Therefore, it is very difficult to trace back to the attacker. The three current location tracking solution: closest access point, triangulation and radio frequency fingerprinting have their own limitations in tracing wireless intruders. In this paper, in the beginning we consider discovering wireless networks techniques and then overview the three current solutions for location tracking and also propose an amendment for triangulation method that aims to overcome the limitations of this method.","","978-1-4244-5365-8;9781424453658","978-0-7695-3925-6;9780769539256","10.1109/ICCEE.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380193","RF;intruder;triangulation method;wireless","Communication system security;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Computer science;Fingerprint recognition;Information systems;Monitoring;Radio frequency;Turing machines;Wireless networks","radio tracking;telecommunication security","closest access point;intruder location tracking;radio frequency fingerprinting;security features;triangulation method;unprotected wireless networks","","0","","11","","","28-30 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining has been proven as an important method to detect intrusions. It has been the recent research focus and trend to apply data mining techniques in intrusion detection system for discovering new types of attacks, but it is still in its infancy. This paper reviews the new development of association rules mining technologies for intrusion detection in wired as well as wireless networks. The challenges and advanced developments of technologies to use association rule mining for intrusion detection are discussed.","2159-6301;21596301","978-0-7695-3932-4;9780769539324","978-1-4244-5467-9;9781424454679","10.1109/FCST.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392848","association rule;data mining;intrusion detection;wired network;wireless network","Association rules;Communication system security;Computer science;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power system protection;Weapons;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;reviews;security of data","data mining;intrusion detection;mining association rules;reviews;wired networks;wireless networks","","5","","27","","","17-19 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
