In addition, we utilized Jena framework to make interaction between MasterAgent and attacks ontology. Our Distributed Intrusion Detection System is a network which contains some IDSagents and a special MasterAgent. MasterAgent contains our proposed attacks ontology. Every time a IDSagent detects an attack or new suspected condition, it sends detection's report for MasterAgent. Therefore, it can extract the semantic relationship among computer attacks and suspected situations in the network with proposed ontology. Finally, the experience shows that the pruposed system reduced the rate of false positive and false negative.","","978-1-4244-4261-4;9781424442614","978-1-4244-4262-1;9781424442621","10.1109/CSICC.2009.5349372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349372","Denial of Service attack;Intrusion Detection System;Ontology","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data models;Distributed computing;Information security;Intrusion detection;Logic;Ontologies;Semantic Web","distributed processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data;semantic Web","MasterAgent;attacks ontology;computer attacks;ontology-based distributed intrusion detection system;semantic Web","","0","","27","","","20-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fuelled by recent advances in networking, communications, computation, software, and hardware technologies, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is considered as the next breakthrough technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is security. Given that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) leverage the potential of IoT quite efficiently, this paper faces the challenge of security attention on a particular, yet broad, context of IP-enabled WSNs. In particular, it proposes a novel threat visualisation tool for such networks, called VisIoT. VisIoT is a human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system that is capable of monitoring and promptly detecting several devastating forms of security attacks, including wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Based on a rigorous, radial visualisation design, VisIoT may expose adversaries conducting one or multiple concurrent attacks against IP-enabled WSNs. The system's visual and anomaly detection efficacy in exposing complex security threats is demonstrated through a number of simulated attack scenarios.","2164-7038;21647038","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247576","","Data visualization;Engines;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;data visualisation;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IP-enabled WSN;Internet of Things;IoT systems security;Sybil attacks;VisIoT;complex security threats;concurrent attacks;hardware technologies;human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system;physical objects;radial visualisation design;security attacks;simulated attack scenarios;software technologies;threat visualisation tool;visual detection efficacy;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","1","","11","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These efforts have been enriched through a formal approach, e.g., the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework, which is discussed in two earlier volumes in this series. This volume should help advance work not only in DLs, but also in the WWW and other information systems. Drawing upon four (Kozievitch, Murthy, Park, Yang) completed and three (Elsherbiny, Farag, Srinivasan) in-process dissertations, as well as the efforts of collaborating researchers and scores of related publications, presentations, tutorials, and reports, this book should advance the DL field with regard to at least six key technologies. By integrating surveys of the state-of-the-art, new research, connections with formalization, case studies, and exercises/projects, this book can serve as a computing or information science textbook. It can upport studies in cyber-security, document management, hypertext/hypermedia, IR, knowledge management, LIS, multimedia, and machine learning. Chapter 1, with a case study on fingerprint collections, focuses on complex (composite, compound) objects, connecting DL and related work on buckets, DCC, and OAI-ORE. Chapter 2, discussing annotations, as in hypertext/hypermedia, emphasizes parts of documents, including images as well as text, managing superimposed information. The SuperIDR system, and prototype efforts with Flickr, should motivate further development and standardization related to annotation, which would benefit all DL and WWW users. Chapter 3, on ontologies, explains how they help with browsing, query expansion, focused crawling, and classification. This chapter connects DLs with the Semantic Web, and uses CTRnet as an example. Chapter 4, on (hierarchical) classification, leverages LIS theory, as well as machine learning, and is important for DLs as well as the WWW. Chapter 5 on extraction from text, covers document segmentation, as well as how to construct a database from heterogeneous collections of references (from ETDs); i.e., converting strings to canonical forms. Chapter 6 surveys the security approaches used in information systems, and explains how those approaches can apply to digital libraries which are not fully open. Given this rich content, those interested in DLs will be able to find solutions to key problems, using the right technologies and methods. We hope this book will help show how formal approaches can enhance the development of suitable technologies and how they can be better integrated with DLs and other information systems.","","9781627050319","","10.2200/S00566ED1V01Y201401ICR033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813167.pdf&bkn=6813166&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2014","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

In this paper we focus on the problem of imbalance between class. Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem like the use of re-sampling techniques. Unfortunately, these methods don't achieve a high performance of learning. On the other hand, it was reported that sample selection techniques (SS) improves the accuracy of classical algorithms of classification by reducing the size of data.

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM.

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result. The performance of the proposed algorithm tested by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves the detection rates as well as reduces the false positives for different types of network intrusions.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997324","boosting;intrusion detection;nave Bayesian classifier","Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Niobium","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDD99 dataset;adaptive network intrusion detection;conditional probability;false positive reduction;intrusion detection learning algorithm;naive Bayesian classifier;network logs similarity;network mining;pattern clustering;supervised learning process;unsupervised learning process","","0","","35","","","8-10 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a defense mechanism which is largely automated and can be implemented on current software defined networking (SDN)-enabled networks. Our mechanism combines normal traffic learning, external blacklist information, and elastic capacity invocation in order to provide effective load control, filtering and service elasticity during an attack. We implement the mechanism and analyze its performance on a physical SDN testbed using a comprehensive set of real-life normal traffic traces and synthetic attack traces.

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network. Results show that the data validation framework can accurately identify subsystems with tampered meters. This framework allows the system operator to restrict the search area to a manageable number of meters in a subsystem.","0885-8950;08858950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2282931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6626355","Advanced metering infrastructure;distribution management system;information integrity and validation;trusted computing","Energy consumption;Energy management;Meter reading;Power measurement;Real-time systems;Support vector machines;Vectors","IP networks;data acquisition;distribution networks;power engineering computing;power system measurement;security of data;telemetry;ubiquitous computing","IP based data collection;billing information;cybertampering;data validation framework;distribution operation;electricity usage;feeder remote terminal units;historical consumption pattern;home energy management systems;home energy meters;malicious consumers;metering data;network operating conditions;online data validation;ubiquitous computing;voltage 12.47 kV;well structured cyberdefense mechanism","","3","","27","","2013-10-09","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We employ MPM, since MPM has been shown a better performance, compared with RF in terms of model building time. To validate the feasibility, we carry out several times of experiments with KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset.

The trained DBN network now identifies any kind of unknown attack in dataset supplied to it and to the best of our knowledge this is first comprehensive paper performing intrusion detection using deep belief nets. The proposed system not only detect attacks but also classify them in five groups with the accuracy of identifying and classifying network activity based on limited, incomplete, and nonlinear data sources. The proposed system achieved detection accuracy about 97.5% for only fifty iterations that is state of art performance compare to the existing system till today for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4673-7564-1;9781467375641","","10.1109/NAECON.2015.7443094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443094","Deep packet inspection;KDD dataset;Neural network;deep belief nets;intrusion detection","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boltzmann machines;computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","DBN;IDS;NSL-KDD dataset;computer networks;deep belief networks;deep neural nets;digital technology;generative neural networks;incoming network traffic;incomplete data sources;intrusion detection system;limited data sources;network activity classification;network activity identification;nonlinear data sources;restricted Boltzmann machines;security threats","","","","23","","","15-19 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they do not directly detect intrusion, but they only monitor the attack symptoms. Therefore, no assumption can be made on the outcome of the attack, no assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed approach results in a better performance of the Intrusion Detection Systems, in terms of increasing diagnosis capacity as well as reducing the service unavailability during an intrusion.","","978-1-4577-1458-0;9781457714580","978-0-7695-4528-8;9780769545288","10.1109/CCP.2011.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061036","denial of service;diagnosis;intrusion recovery;intrusion tolerance;web services","Computer crime;Detectors;Engines;Monitoring;Simple object access protocol;XML","Web services;XML;computer network security","Deeply-Nested XML;Web services;denial of service attacks;information system protection;intrusion detection system;intrusion effect diagnosis;intrusion tolerance technique","","8","","29","","","21-24 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the commonly used kernel functions of SVM such as RBF kernel and Gauss kernel are non-orthogonal, whose detection capacity and speed are unsatisfactory for complex non-linear system in IDS. LS-SVM is an evolution of classical SVM. It looks for the solution by solving linear equations instead of a convex quadratic programming in classical SVM. Wavelet kernel function has the capability of approximately orthogonal and multi-scale analysis, and has better classification and generalizing ability.

At the meantime, the number of rule subsets is altered according to the quantity of actual rules and the structure of a system to achieve better matching efficiency. Theoretical analysis and the experiments conducted indicate that comparing with the conventional grouping algorithms, the TFA requires far fewer groups at the relatively similar level of storage space compression; and comparing with other classical DFA improved algorithms, the TFA achieves shorter pretreatment time and demands smaller storage space with no noticeably decrease in the matching efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICTC.2015.7354737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354737","deterministic finite automata;grouping algorithm;regular expression;rule templates;templates finite automata","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Engines;Explosions;Switches","deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;security of data","DFA;TFA;deterministic finite automata;intrusion detection system;regular expression matching algorithm;template finite automata grouping algorithm","","","","13","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that these measures can be fused and generalized into a generic feature-selection (GeFS) measure. Further on, we propose a new feature-selection method that ensures globally optimal feature sets. The new approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming problem (M01LP) by using the branchand-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear (O(n)) in the number n of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our GeFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application.

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-3-8007-3092-6;9783800730926","978-3-00-024883-2;9783000248832","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","2","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QRS provides the basis for all ECG classification methods. We proposed a novel method for classification of ECG beats using repetition based packet processing and ECG waveform profiling. We first developed a real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing to find exact QRS points. Then we proposed a classifier for profiling an ECG of normal patient.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.","","978-1-4577-0455-0;9781457704550","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478","Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks","Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks","inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network","","0","","11","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over collected data, infer/establish the so called normal or typical usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/NETWKS.2014.6959218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959218","Monitoring Framework;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Databases;Facebook;Privacy;Security;Servers;Web pages","graphical user interfaces;relational databases;social networking (online)","daily digital interactions;graphical user interface;innovative social interaction platforms;relational database;social network events collection;user behaviour analysis","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5;1424401445","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","18","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, sophisticated attackers attempt to disable the IDS before they launch a thorough attack. Therefore, to accomplish its function, an IDS should have some mechanism to guarantee uninterrupted detection service even in the face of IDS component failures due to attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion-tolerant mechanism for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that employ multiple independent components. The mechanism monitors the detection units and the hosts on which the units reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues. We implement the intrusion-tolerant mechanism based on the CSI-KNN-based NIDS and evaluate the prototype in the face of component failures. The results demonstrate that the mechanism can effectively tolerate intrusions.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529353","Intrusion detection systems;Intrusion-tolerance","Availability;Computer crashes;Detectors;Face detection;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic","pattern classification;security of data","CSI-KNN;intrusion-tolerant mechanism;network intrusion detection systems;uninterrupted detection service","","2","","13","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, the interactions between the attacker and the administrator are modeled as a non-cooperative zero-sum multistage game and it is modeled as a minmax game tree where the attacker is the leader and the administrator is the follower. Alternating the actions between the administrator and the attacker forms the game tree, each of them will be allowed to play a single action at any given time.

Fourth International Conference on","20080624","2007","","","449","458","Unauthorized rogue access points (APs), such as those brought into a corporate campus by employees, pose a security threat as they may be poorly managed or insufficiently secured. Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1;9781424414321","978-1-4244-1433-8;9781424414338","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. Our method is employed to prevent the system with high efficiency and low use of system resources.","","978-1-4673-2981-1;9781467329811","","10.1109/CICN.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375255","Data Stream;Frequent Pattern Mining;Intrusion Prevention","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Intrusion detection;Servers","data mining;security of data","anomaly intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;massive data streams;network security architecture;online frequent item set mining;time-sensitive sliding window","","0","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A standard IDS may not be very effective or even unsuitable for an organisational or individuals' requirements. For enhancing the power of IDS, security experts have been embedding additional level of intelligence by employing fuzzy logic, neural network, evolutionary techniques and many other AI techniques. This paper presents a fuzzy inference based intrusion detection system, FI-Snort. FI-Snort uses the most popular open source IDS, Snort, as a baseline.

However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.","2161-024X;2161024X","978-1-4244-7301-4;9781424473014","","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681","AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images","Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing","Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis","AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit","","0","","12","","","18-20 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

Based on this new viewpoint, we present a four-layer model of artificial immune system (AIS) . Also, a mechanism of reasoning with uncertainty is proposed to increase the detection accuracy. There are three merits of this novel model. First, danger theory provides a method of 'grounding' the immune response to reduce false alarms. Second, each layer of the model can work independently and interact with each other, so the efficiency of detecting is greatly improved. Last, the reasoning with uncertainty allows the model to dynamically adapt to real network traffic.","2161-9646;21619646","978-1-4244-1311-9;9781424413119","","10.1109/WICOM.2007.1554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341329","","Artificial immune systems;Biological system modeling;Computer science;Educational institutions;Grounding;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Uncertainty","artificial immune systems;inference mechanisms;security of data;uncertainty handling","AIS;IDS;artificial immune system;danger theory;four-layer model design;intrusion detection system;network traffic;uncertain reasoning","","0","","10","","","21-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario. The proposed system, unlike other systems such as VM Introspection (VMI), does not require any knowledge about VMs from inside nor requiring any OS or hypervisor modifications.","","978-1-4673-5325-0;9781467353250","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470945","Cloud Computing Security;Host-Based Anomaly Detection;IDS;IaaS Security;System Calls Monitoring;Virtual Machine Monitoring","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Linux;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machining","Linux;cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IaaS environments;Infrastructure-as-a-Service;Linux KVM-based reference;VM introspection;VMI;detecting anomalies;hypervisor modifications;intrusion detection system;public cloud environments;virtual machine host system call analysis","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study presents an incremental network traffic classification algorithm called incremental particle swarm optimisation to enhance the performance of IDS. Based on semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation, the proposed algorithm is composed of two major phases: (i) the classification phase is employed to create the classifier for differentiating the type of network flows from the training dataset and (ii) the clustering phase is then used to classify the newly incoming patterns, which may contain known and unknown network flow types.","2047-4954;20474954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2012.0209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584858","","","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;classification phase;clustering phase;efficient network management method;high-quality network services;incremental network traffic classification algorithm;incremental particle swarm optimisation;intrusion detection system;network management system;semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Simulation results show that with nine anchor nodes in a 1 km by 1 km area, the algorithm is capable of estimating the intruderpsilas position within a radius of 45 meters in 60% of the cases.

However, peer-to-peer traffic may compromise the performance of enterprise critical networked applications or network-based tasks or may overload the network infrastructure of Internet service providers, being desirable that this traffic be blocked in some situations. However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The proposed method is based on eMule signatures, which are coded as SNORT rules, this system being used to detect and block eMule traffic.

Firstly, the image energy model is established, the energy minimization constraint technology is used to make the average output energy of local image area be minimum, and the infrared image noise and clutter signal are suppressed. The directional gradient features of infrared target are extracted, and the potential small targets can be identified with its direction gradient in sequential frames. The multiple frames determination results are obtained, and the fusion result is used to detect the target. Simulation result shows that the algorithm does not need the prediction of background, and it can overcome the interference of cloud in high altitude sky with low SNR, the small target detection accuracy is improved greatly.
