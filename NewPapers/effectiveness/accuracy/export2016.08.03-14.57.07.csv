They are designed to take an advantage of receiving sensor signals from networked sensors by building the models of the sensor signals and, on the higher network levels, objects under measurement. The methods are based on statistical processing of the measurement results coming from sensors and employing those models to detect the anomalies caused either by an equipment malfunctioning or human malicious activities and mistakes.

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds. The results show first time how merging 802.11n wireless technology can still be accurately separated from Ethernet hosts, even as it continues to improve.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682342","802.11b/g/n;Rogue Access Point;TCP/IP;Temporal Analysis","Classification algorithms;Communication system security;Equations;Ethernet networks;IP networks;Logic gates;Wireless communication","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","802.11b/g/n;802.11n wireless technology merging;ACK local round trip times;Ethernet;FIN;RAPiD;SYN;firewall;indirect rogue access points detection system;local area network;network attack vector;physical endpoint security;rogue wireless access points;security threat;session-based temporal characteristics;temporal TCP/IP characteristics;traffic;unauthorized wireless host identification;wireless hosts detection","","1","","37","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Event-based evidence refers to observations (or detections) of intrusive actions (e.g., IDS alerts), while state-based evidence refers to observations of the effects of intrusions on system states. Based on the interdependency between event-based and state-based evidence, this paper develops techniques to automatically integrate complementary evidence into Bayesian networks, and reason about uncertain or unknown intrusion evidence based on verified evidence.

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

Among the artificial intelligent techniques, traditional supervised learning techniques are not appropriate for an auto-mated network management and specially to detect temporal changes in network intrusion patterns and characteristics. The reason is that supervised learning needs the manager. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters. Our system labels the map produced by SOM using correlations between features for an auto-mated network management. We experiments our system with KDD Cup 1999 data set.

The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8;9781467302418","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","2","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naive fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naive fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably Attack multipliers and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naive fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Infection in social network are information contents in any of the form like text, images, audio, video, animation etc. There are two main methods for spreading of content over web; conserved spread (SIS model) and non conserved spread (SIR model). This paper uses SI (Susceptible-Infected) model. Infection flow behaviour is analyzed by taking the data i.e. no of infected nodes of a social network in NetLogo environment and simulated for a different size and different average degree network taking input 100 times which helps in correction of data and improves the accuracy of the results.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","8","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost. The proposed approach demonstrates that interactive visualization can be successfully combined with network security mechanisms to greatly improve the intrusion detection capabilities","","1-4244-0591-2;1424405912","1-4244-0592-0;1424405920","10.1109/VAST.2006.261435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4035753","C.2.0 [Computer-Communication Networks]: GeneralSecurity and protection;H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and PresentationUser interfaces;Interactive Detection;Topology Visualization;Visualization on Network Security;Wireless Networks;Wormhole Attacks","Communication system security;Detection algorithms;Hardware;Information security;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Visualization;Wireless networks","data visualisation;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication security","automatic detection algorithm;interactive visualization of wormholes;interactive wormhole detection;intrusion detection;large scale wireless network;network topology visualization;routing protocol;user interaction","","3","","43","","","Oct. 31 2006-Nov. 2 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the suffering problem of these systems is that a large amount of non-critical alarms will be generated during the detection process which increase the analysis burden and lower the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems in real deployment. We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms. Moreover, we indicate that our scheme is compatible to different representations of intrusion detection signatures. In the evaluation, we realize our generic scheme to a specific implementation and explore its performance in experimental settings.","","978-1-4577-2008-6;9781457720086","","10.1109/CIS.2011.219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6128270","contextual signature;hash function;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Concrete;Databases;Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection","cryptography;digital signatures","contextual signatures;hash function;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","25","","","3-4 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9;9781467311809","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","7","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4;1595933344","","10.1145/1127777.1127803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we design an incentive model based on trust management by using game theory for peers to collaborate truthfully without free-riding in an IDN environment. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in an incentive compatible manner. Using duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium.

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","31","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach.

The intrusion of a physical object (or human) will disrupt the radio-frequency magnetic field and can be detected by observing the change in radio attenuation. This gives the basis for the radio tomographic imaging technology, which has recently been developed for passively monitoring and tracking objects. Due to noise and the lack of knowledge about the number and the sizes of intruding objects, multiobject intrusion detection and localization is a challenging issue. This paper proposes an extended variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) algorithm in treating this problem. The extended VB-GMM algorithm applies a Gaussian mixture model to model the changed radio attenuation in a monitored field due to the intrusion of an unknown number of objects and uses a modified version of the variational Bayesian approach for model estimation. Real-world data from both outdoor and indoor experiments (using the radio tomographic imaging technology) have been used to verify the high accuracy and the robustness of the proposed multiobject localization algorithm.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2432038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105967","Gaussian mixture model;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Multiple object localization;multiobject localization;physical intrusion detection;radio tomographic imaging;variational Bayesian;variational Bayesian (VB)","Attenuation;Bayes methods;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Tomography","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;indoor radio;mixture models;object detection;object tracking;radiofrequency imaging;variational techniques","VB-GMM algorithm;indoor experiment;low-data-rate wireless network;multiobject intrusion detection;multiobject intrusion localization;object tracking;outdoor experiment;physical intrusion detection;radio attenuation;radio tomographic imaging technology;radiofrequency magnetic field;variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model algorithm","","0","","42","","2015-05-12","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction.

In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported.

For the structural-cluster approach, protein structural segments are grouped into different structural clusters using multiple structural alignments and unsupervised clustering algorithms. The support vector machine (SVM) has shown superior classification performance in various bioinformatics applications because of its strong generalization capability. In order to overcome disadvantages of building one SVM over the whole sample space, the clustering support vector machine (CSVM) was proposed to predict distance matrices, torsion angles, and secondary structures for backbone -carbon atoms of protein sequence segments. The special features of CSVMs enable the training tasks for each CSVM to be parallelized.

Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities.

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack. The proposed system detects different stealth scan and malformed packets scan. Since the probability of using stealth scan in real attack is very high, this system can identify the real attacks in the initial stage itself and preventive action can be taken.","","978-1-4244-4790-9;9781424447909","978-1-4244-4791-6;9781424447916","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422996","Anomaly detection;chi-square;flow;scan detection","Computer networks;Floods;High-speed networks;IP networks;Information analysis;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","IDS;IPS;SNORT intrusion detection system;automatic behavior analysis;chi-square technique;firewall;flow based anomaly detection system;intrusion detection;malicious traffic;network traffic;security mechanisms","","0","","22","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats. Our analysis reveal conflicts in each of them.","","978-1-4244-5344-3;9781424453443","978-0-7695-3805-1;9780769538051","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341717","attack signitures;intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer security;Event detection;Hemorrhaging;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Payloads;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic","knowledge based systems;security of data","bleeding edge threat;conflict detection;open source Snort IDS;rule management framework;rule misconfiguration classification;rule misconfiguration discovery;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS.

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces.

The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system.

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Herein, these authors present a framework for network management suit that, along with network health, monitors inputs from avionics, video surveillance system, weather monitoring system, and manual pilot alarms, and based on the situation, reconfigures the on-board networking devices to stream appropriate flight-critical data to the ground station. The proposed framework attempts to provide a comprehensive user interface for the flight health monitoring crew with all relevant data.","0885-8985;08858985","","","10.1109/MAES.2009.5208553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5208553","","Aerospace electronics;Air safety;Aircraft;Condition monitoring;Data analysis;Data security;IP networks;Streaming media;User interfaces;Video surveillance","aerospace safety;avionics;telecommunication network management;user interfaces;video surveillance","Internet-enabled aircrafts;aircraft health management network;aircraft safety;aircraft-related data;avionics data;flight-critical data;manual pilot alarms;network management;network security;physical security parameters;user interface;video surveillance;weather monitoring","","0","","9","","","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The merit of NFV is challenged by control challenges related to the selection of NF implementations, discovery and reservation of sufficient network and server resources, and interconnecting both in a way which ful fills SLAs related to reliability and scalability. This paper details the role of a scalable orchestrator in charge of finding and reserving adequate resources. The latter will steer network and cloud control and management platforms to actually reserve and deploy requested services. We highlight the role of involved interfaces, propose elements of algorithmic components, and will identify major blocks in orchestration time in a proof of concept prototype which accounts for most functional parts in the considered architecture.

However, the rapid increase of link speeds and throughputs - especially in larger networks such as backbone networks - seriously constrains this approach. First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics. Flow export technologies are nowadays embedded in most high-end packet forwarding devices and are widely used for network management, which makes this approach economically attractive.","2325-5366;23255366","978-9949-9544-0-7;9789949954407","","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916403","Flow-Based Intrusion Detection;High-speed Networks;Intrusion Detection;Legal Inspection;Network Security","High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Standards;Taxonomy","computer network management;computer network security","DPI;backbone networks;deep packet inspection;flow-based intrusion detection;high-speed networks;network management;packet forwarding devices","","0","","30","","","3-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality.

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques.

Another is a misuse detection technique called Clustering. Each technique determines an intrusion warning (IW) level for each audit event. The IW levels from different intrusion detection techniques are then combined using a fusion technique into a composite IW level, 0 for normal, 1 for intrusive, and any value in between to signify, the intrusiveness. We also present the intrusion detection performance of the Chi-square and Clustering techniques","","0-7695-1212-7;0769512127","","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932187","","Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information security;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Process control;Prototypes","computer network management;security of data;statistical process control;supervisory programs;system monitoring","Clustering;Internet;anomaly detection;audit event;chi-square;computer intrusion detection;distributed host-based intrusion detection system;e-commerce systems;fusion technique;intrusion detection techniques;intrusion warning level;misuse detection technique;network security;statistical process control","","8","","16","","","2001","12 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a high percentage of alerts generated by such systems are liable to be false positives. False positives create considerable administrative overheads, since these alerts typically require manual intervention from a network administrator. In order to reduce the number of false positives, we propose a novel infrastructure approach involving what we call network quarantine channels. The network quarantine channels and associated techniques are used to perform further interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic. The network quarantine channels are used to provide a more accurate assessment of the potential attacks sent by suspicious hosts, before sending the final status of the alerts to the IDS monitor for the network administrator's response","","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198807","","Data analysis;Databases;Frequency;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication channels;telecommunication traffic","administrative overheads;detection capability;false positives;intelligent infrastructure strategy;intrusion detection systems;network quarantine channels;suspicious network traffic","","0","","41","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
