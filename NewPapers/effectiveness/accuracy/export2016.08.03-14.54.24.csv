Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security. We identify factors that are critical for the efficacy and acceptance of learning methods in security. We present directions and perspectives for successfully linking both fields and aim at fostering research on intelligent security methods.","","978-1-4577-1528-0;9781457715280","","10.1109/SysSec.2011.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092778","computer security;machine learning","Internet;Learning systems;Machine learning;Malware;Software","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","Internet;bot networks;computer security;computer systems;computer worms;machine learning;plethora;security threats","","1","","18","","","6-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior. Simulation results provide evidence the effectiveness for achieving detection of exhaustion attacks with improved detection rate.","2164-7143;21647143","978-1-4673-5117-1;9781467351171","","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416593","DDoS;Detection;Exhaustion attacks;FLS;IEEE 802.15.4;MAC Layer;Security","Batteries;Fuzzy logic;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Security;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;computer network security;fuzzy logic;personal area networks","DDoS;IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer;LR-WPAN;communication capabilities;computation capabilities;detection mechanism;distributed denial of service;exhaustion attack detection;fuzzy logic system;low rate wireless personal area network;malicious attacks;security system;sensor power;sensory resources;untrusted environments","","0","","29","","","27-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3;9781479938353","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927;10636927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework.

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers.

It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the sandboxing systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, a problem in existing sandboxing systems is the amount of overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a sandboxing system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a sandboxed application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application. We implemented the system on Linux and made a preliminary evaluation.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420266","","Control systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Invasive software;Kernel;Linux;Operating systems;Resource virtualization;Resumes;Security","Linux;parallel programming;security of data","Linux;sandboxing system;speculative security check","","4","3","24","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scalability issue is alleviated with hierarchical and decentralised approaches, but this comes at a cost of additional implementation complexity and lower algorithm quality. Introduced is a new alert correlation architecture based on Hadoop. The developed architecture allows for greater scalability whilst maintaining algorithm expressiveness and design simplicity. It incorporates alert aggregation, verification, and correlation components, which together provide for a clear and succinct view of potentially malicious activity. Each component was tested against a series of datasets that represent potential real world scenarios across a cluster of varying size. The results demonstrate that all components in the architecture have the ability to scale across many nodes in a cluster, allowing for the processing of large and complex attack scenarios in a timely manner.","","978-1-4799-8690-3;9781479986903","","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389673","Hadoop;aggregation;correlation;verification","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Scalability","data handling;formal verification;parallel processing;security of data;software architecture","Hadoop;IDS;alert aggregation;alert correlation architecture;alert verification;attack scenario;intrusion detection system","","","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Misuse detection systems use signature databases to detect known attacks. However, it is difficult to keep the database up to date with the rate of discovery of vulnerabilities. They also cannot detect zero-day attacks. By contrast, anomaly detection systems learn the normal behavior of the system and monitor its activity to detect any deviations from the normal. Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives.

Then, we can determine whether we need to perform network or security operation. We apply clustering algorithm for AID and classification algorithm for MID. The nonlinear adaptive system is trained for running MID and AID in parallel. Proposed parallel system is more lightweight and simple to operate even if the number of incident patterns is increased. Experimental results in the case where false positive is frequently caused show that our method is functional with a recognition rate of attacks less than 10%, while finding the anomaly status.

We have used mobile agents to carry intrusion alerts from consumer virtual machines to the management server where correlation takes place. Our system can detect the intrusions on virtual machines, identify the vulnerable ports, and can correlate malicious events to detect distributed intrusions in a cloud based network. Mobile agents are also used to update the signature database at virtual machines being monitored. Mobile agents, being lightweight and flexible software programs, reduce the network load by carrying intrusion-related data and code. DIDMACC provides a scalable and robust intrusion detection system which is a key requirement for cloud networks. We have validated the security of our system using Ptybull 2.0.

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1;9781424475261","978-0-7695-4107-5;9780769541075","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 17th IEEE","20040712","2004","","","88","98","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become an important part of operational computer security. They are the last line of defense against malicious hackers and help detect ongoing attacks as well as mitigate their damage. However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2169-X;076952169X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","10","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables.

Most existing models assume that the distributions for transitions between states are exponential. However, this assumption does not hold in many real cases. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models. Empirical experiments show that the semi-Markov model predicts the system behaviors with high accuracy. Furthermore, in this paper we evaluate the impact of intrinsic system deficiencies and attack behaviors on the survivability of intrusion tolerant database systems.","","978-1-4244-5879-0;9781424458790","","10.1109/ARES.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438108","Database Security;Intrusion Tolerance;Modeling and Evaluation;Semi-Markov Process;Survivability","Availability;Benchmark testing;Data security;Database systems;Degradation;Educational institutions;Humans;Information security;Predictive models","Markov processes;database management systems;reliability theory;security of data;state-space methods","ITDB;intrinsic system deficiencies;intrusion tolerant database systems;nonexponential distributions;novel quantitative measures;resilient system;semi Markov survivability evaluation model;state-space models;system behaviors","","3","","19","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality. The experimental results show that by combining our defined ROC curve-based measure, namely relative expected cost, our developed filter can achieve a better outcome in the aspect of cost consideration.","2159-1547;21591547","978-1-4577-1778-9;9781457717789","","10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269608","Computational Intelligence;False Alarm Reduction;Intelligent Decision Support and Control Systems;Intrusion detection;Performance Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Support vector machines","alarm systems;computer network security;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation","NIDS;ROC curve-based measure;cost analysis;decision quality;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network attacks;network environment;network intrusion detection system;single-algorithm performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries.

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-4498-4;9781424444984","","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier.

A formal framework for signature-based IDS event detection is developed to aid this discussion. Through this framework it is shown that, even for the simplest case of a single isolated attack, time correlation is not a sufficient approach for noncoincidently located heterogeneous sensors due to the nondeterministic nature of network propagation delays. An approach is then discussed to include additional information about the knowledge domains of the respective IDS sensors, at a per trigger level, to improve the correlation accuracy.","","0-7803-7978-0;0780379780","","10.1109/PACRIM.2003.1235911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235911","","Clocks;Computer networks;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Observability;Payloads;Propagation delay;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","handwriting recognition;safety systems;sensors;telecommunication security","correlation accuracy improvement;data volume overwhelming;event detection;heterogeneous IDS system;heterogeneous sensor;intrusion detection system;network propagation delay;signature-based IDS alert;time-based correlation","","0","","7","","","28-30 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation. Meanwhile, by on-line we can estimate continuously and refresh the value of Hurst according to the latest network traffic, and then we can get the latest traffic data and speed up the process of anomaly detection.

Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data. Experiments on KDDCup 1999 data show the substantial improvement of the detection ability of the proposed method.","pending","978-1-4577-0714-8;9781457707148","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060463","Fuzzy GNP;Genetic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Multi-Dimensional Probability Distribution;Rule Pruning","Association rules;Computers;Economic indicators;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Intrusion detection","data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;security of data;statistical distributions","KDDCupl999 data;class association rule pruning;continuous valued data;data mining;directed graph structure;evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining;genetic network programming;global search;hybrid rule pruning;intrusion detection ability;multidimensional probability distribution;node reusability;post-processing method;real network connection data;training data","","0","","16","","","13-18 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we apply a type of filtering we term IDS stream splitting, which consists of classifying each packet as either trusted or un-trusted when it is encountered between the sniffer and the IDS (within the firewall). This classification allows for fewer packets to be sent to an IDS devoted to examining un-trusted traffic. The logic of the splitter looks at each packet as part of a connection and give it a trust ranking from [0..1] using a fuzzy logic model. Initial results indicate that this approach can significantly reduce false alarm rates while increasing system up time.","","0-7803-8185-8;0780381858","","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292760","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Filtering;Fuzzy logic;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;fuzzy logic;message authentication;telecommunication traffic","IDS stream splitting;false alarms;fuzzy logic model;intrusion detection system;network attacks;network stream splitting;sniffer;system up time;trusted traffic;untrusted traffic","","0","","7","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As ICSs are used to control critical infrastructure processes such as power generation and distribution, it is vital to develop methods to detect tampering. A system employing our measurement technique could discover if an insider has made unauthorized changes to a device's logic. Our architecture also has advantages because the monitoring node is separate from the measured device.

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Miller","Department of EE & CSE, Penn State University, USA","2007 IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","20080716","2007","","","1","7","Zero-day attacks - especially those that hide the attack exploit by using code obfuscation and encryption - remain a formidable challenge to existing network defenses. Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2418434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090949","Data mining;insider attack;intrusion detection and protection;system call (SC);users' behaviors","Computers;Data mining;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-04-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood. This paper describes an agent-based framework designed to manage a set of visual analytic components in order to improve a security analyst's understanding and ability to classify the threats to the network that they govern. In the proof-of-concept system an agent selects the most effective method for event aggregation, given a particular set of events which have been generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

In particular, some are building models mimicking the mechanisms in the biological immune system (BIS) to better understand its natural processes and simulate its dynamical behavior in the presence of antigens/pathogens. Most of the AIS models, however, emphasize designing artifacts - computational algorithms, techniques using simplified models of various immunological processes and functionalities. Like other biologically-inspired techniques, such as artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and cellular automata, AISs also try to extract ideas from the BIS in order to develop computational tools for solving science and engineering problems. Although still relatively young, the artificial immune system (AIS) is emerging as an active and attractive, field involving models, techniques and applications of greater diversity","1556-603X;1556603X","","","10.1109/MCI.2006.329705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4129847","","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Buildings;Computational intelligence;Computational modeling;Immune system;Pathogens","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence","antigens;artificial immune systems;biological immune system;computational intelligence;computational models;dynamical behavior;pathogens","","93","1","67","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
