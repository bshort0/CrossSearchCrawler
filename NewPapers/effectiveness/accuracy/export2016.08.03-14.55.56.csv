In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4673-6320-4;9781467363204","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the need for dedicated Grid Intrusion Detection Systems (Grid-IDS) is motivated by giving such an example attack on a federated service protocol. A generic Grid-IDS architecture is presented as well as a concrete realization based on various Web services specifications. At the heart of the introduced Grid-IDS architecture is the correlation service, which receives the event information from sensors distributed across the federation and detects intrusions by analyzing and correlating the events. A protocol-aware correlation service is proposed, in which each service protocol is abstracted to a generic representation - a relationship of roles. Finally, based on the developed Grid-IDS and the gathered experiences, an approach towards intrusion tolerance is presented and discussed.","","978-1-4244-0974-7;9781424409747","978-1-4244-0975-4;9781424409754","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550328","Grid;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Tolerance;SOA","Access protocols;Authentication;Authorization;Banking;Europe;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National electric code;Service oriented architecture","","","","0","","36","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","2325-5552;23255552","0-7803-9569-7;0780395697","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","17","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity. Unfortunately, these strategies are not directly applicable to WSNs since ad-hoc networks are not as resource constrained as WSNs.This paper tries to develop distributed algorithms for detecting anomalous activity in information flow patterns in large-scale sensor networks.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms. To understand the implications of these constraints and to benchmark the performance of the system, we have performed a series of experiments processing multilingual documents.

It is also important, however, to automatically respond to the attack and maintain the power discharge at the normal level. In this study, we introduce a method designed to detect the defective process and to self-correct the abnormality by stopping or delaying the suspicious actions.

Most email archives, however, are protected by reusable passwords that are often weak and can be easily compromised. To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7;9781424443567","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Node misbehaviour in ad hoc network is caused by lack of cooperation and goes under the name node selfishness. A selfish node does not directly intent to damage other nodes with active attacks but it simply does not cooperate in network operation, saving battery life for its own communication. The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed. This paper we deal with misbehaving nodes in MANETs that drop packets supposed to be relayed, whose purpose may be either saving their resources or launching security attacks. We propose a new solution to monitor, detect and safely exclude the misbehaving node planned around six modules.","","978-1-4577-0588-5;9781457705885","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972464","MANET;Reputation;Security;Selfish Node;Trust","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;active attack;battery life;k-neighbourhood local reputation system;network operation;network performance;routing misbehaviour mitigation;security attack;selforganizing mobile ad hoc network;wireless mobile ad hoc network","","1","","23","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","2","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New rules are used to detect novel or known network attacks. A training and testing dataset proposed by DARPA is used to evolve and evaluate these new rules. The proof of concept implementation shows that the rule generated by GP has a low false positive rate (FPR), a low false negative rate (FNR) and a high rate of detecting unknown attacks.

Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection.

To provide secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) in this environment. To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack.","0190-3918;01903918","978-1-4244-7918-4;9781424479184","978-0-7695-4157-0;9780769541570","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599084","cloud computing;cooperative intrusion detection system;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computer crime;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Simulation","Internet;security of data;software agents","DoS attack;Internet;cloud computing networks;cloud computing region exchange;cooperative IDS system;cooperative agent;cooperative intrusion detection system framework;distributed denial-of-service attack","","26","2","10","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among many network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), open source systems have gained substantial preference due to their flexibility, support and cost effectiveness. Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration). Furthermore, the findings can be applied to other signature based intrusion detection systems for refining their performance and detection capability.","","978-1-4799-1287-2;9781479912872","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725321","Distributes Denial of Service;Network Intrusion Detection System;Network Security;Penetration Testing;Snort;Vulnerability Assessment and Defense","Availability;Computer crime;Floods;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Servers","computer network security;public domain software;transport protocols","DDoS attacks;NIDS;Snort detection capability;Snort packet handling capability;TCP flooding distributed denial of service attack;detection accuracy;hardware configurations;internal architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security;open source systems;rate filtration;signature database","","1","","26","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy. Security reports generated by GHIDS are indexed not only by local user ID, but also by grid user ID.

Computers are integral part of everyday operations. Organizations depend on them. A computer failure will have a critical impact on the organization. The term Security brings to mind all shorts of issues that refer to data protection and prevention of unauthorised access. The common motives for computer crimes could be lure for money, revenge, terrorism, fun, recognition or curiosity. Information systems can be attacked by outsiders who may penetrate a computer system or by insiders who are authorised to use the resources but misuse their authorization. An attacker may disrupt the information system of an organization (active attack) or gain access to its sensitive information (passive attack). Although no direct damage is done in a passive attack, any leak in information could have drastic repercussions for the organization. In simple words, security can be defined as: protecting information system from intended access. The goal of network management is to provide users with a quality of service. To meet this goal, network services plan involve strategic and technical planning of engineering, operations and maintenance of the network. The field of network security and management is constantly undergoing changes in technology, applications and hence the need for continually changing skills set on the part of academics.

Digital forensics is a branch of computer security that makes use of electronic evidence to build up a criminal case or for troubleshooting purposes. Advances have been made since the advent of Cloud computing in addressing issues that came with the Cloud including that of security. However, not all aspects of security are advancing. Developments in digital forensics still leave a lot to be desired in terms of standards and appropriate digital forensic tools that are applicable in the Cloud. To achieve that, standards as well as standard tools are required for successful evidence collection, preservation, analysis and conviction in case of a criminal case. This paper contributes towards addressing issues in digital forensics by presenting an algorithm that can be used in the evidence identification phase of a digital forensic process. Data in Cloud environments exist in the Internet or in networked environments and data is always accessed remotely. There is therefore at least one connection to a host that exists in a Cloud environment. In a case of a computer system that hosts a Cloud service, the number of connections from clients can be very large. In such a scenario it is very hard to identify an attacker from both active and recently disconnected connections to a host. This may require an investigator to probe all individual IP addresses connected to the host which can be time consuming and costly. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can identify and rank remote hosts that are connected to a victim host and that may be associated with a malicious activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses probabilities to identify and rank suspicious remote hosts connected to a victim host. This algorithm helps minimize the effort required of investigators to probe each IP address that is connected to a victim as connected IP addresses will be prio- itized according to their rank.","2330-9881;23309881","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641044","Cloud Computing;Digital Forensic Processes;Digital Forensics;Intrusion Detection","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","cloud computing;digital forensics;probability","Internet;cloud computing;cloud environment;computer security;digital forensic investigation;digital forensic tools;electronic evidence;evidence identification phase;individual IP addresses;malicious activity;probability;remote host ranking;remote host selection;victim host","","0","","16","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem.

This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612","","Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network","","11","","26","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is largely due to the integration of complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration. The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks. The additional problem of obscurity has resulted in increasing concealing of unauthorized access, identity thefts, privacy and security breaches of highly sensitive data, interception through the man-in-the-middle and intermediary systems.

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678;15450678","978-1-4673-1423-7;9781467314237","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming. In the numerical experiments, we point out that the payoff of the secondary users increases with the number of available jamming-free channels and is eventually limited by the behavior of primary users.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502451","","Cognitive radio;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Emulation;Frequency;Jamming;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","Markov processes;cognitive radio;jamming;stochastic games;wireless channels","Markovian game model;antijamming scenario;jamming-free channels;multichannel cognitive radio systems;stochastic zero-sum game model;zero-sum interactions","","14","","20","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a gray box since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8;9781424438358","978-0-7695-3816-7;9780769538167","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","2","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6;0780397886","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4;9781467300254","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was based on the concept of genetic optimization, an optimized algorithm was proposed, and then the definition methods of danger signals were given. After that, the danger was determined according to the changes of different variables which were represented the danger signals in computer system, and then the danger was defined at last. Finally, the two levels immune alarm response model was presented. The definition method of danger signal is more stable, robust, efficient and feasible.","","978-0-7695-3804-4;9780769538044","","10.1109/ICICTA.2009.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5287648","artificial immune;danger definition;danger theory;genetic optimization;intrusion detection","Artificial immune systems;Biology computing;Computer hacking;Computer science;Educational institutions;Genetics;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Robustness","genetic algorithms;security of data","artificial immune systems;danger signal;genetic optimization;immune alarm response model","","0","","10","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
