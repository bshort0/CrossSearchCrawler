Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","2162-8998;21628998","978-0-7695-3843-3;9780769538433","978-1-4244-5068-8;9781424450688","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.","","978-1-4673-0681-2;9781467306812","","10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493","","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","1-1 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Di Pietro","Dipt. di Informatica, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Italy","Second International Workshop on Hot Topics in Peer-to-Peer Systems","20051024","2005","","","52","61","Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.","","0-7695-2417-6;0769524176","","10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791","","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering","","12","2","23","","","21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20030225","2002","2","","1503","1508 vol.2","Traditional intrusion detection systems can be broadly classified as misuse and anomaly detectors. Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery. While encryption provides secure communication channels, it leaves the end points exposed. Our security system has the additional capability of handling insider attacks relevant in this context.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179706","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Context;Cryptography;Detectors;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Probes;Scalability","computer network management;graphs;military communication;military computing;telecommunication security","encapsulated user intent;exposed end points;insider attacks;meta-operations;operator fault recovery;reasoning framework;reference graph;scalable implementation;user level anomaly detection system;workspaces","","3","","31","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As it is used for both supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and connecting vehicles to external resources including cloud services, Internet, and user devices while improving the road traffic conditions, VANET is a Key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As such, VANET can be exposed to cyber attacks related to the wireless environment, and those of traditional information technologies systems it is connected to. However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET. In this paper focusing on attack detection, we show how using an implementation combining observation of events and incidents from multiple sources at different layers Sybil nodes can be detected regardless of the VANET architecture.","","","","10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7245674","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) security;attack detection","Communication system security;Cryptography;IP networks;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","IEEE802.11p standard;VANET;attack detection;cryptographic-centric mechanisms;cyber attacks;intelligent transportation systems;mobile ad hoc network;security analytics;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless mobile environment","","0","","24","","","5-7 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection.

As the march of cloud continues, it brings both new opportunities and new security challenges. To take advantage of those opportunities while minimizing risks, we argue that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) integrated in the cloud is one of the best existing solutions nowadays in the field. The concept of intrusion detection was known since past and was first proposed in 1980s. Since that time IDSs are evolving. However, even several efforts have been made in the area of Intrusion Detection Systems for cloud computing environment, many attacks still prevail. Therefore, the work presented in this paper proposes a multi-criteria analysis and a comparative study between several IDS architectures designed to work in cloud computing environments. To achieve this objective, in the first place we will search in the state of the art for several consistent IDS architectures designed to work in a cloud environment. Whereas, in a second step we will establish the criteria that will be useful for the evaluation of architectures. Later, using the approach of multi-criteria decision analysis MacBeth (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) we will evaluate the criteria and assign to each one the appropriate weight according to their importance in the field of IDS architectures in cloud computing. The last step is to evaluate architectures against the criteria and collecting results of the model constructed in the previous steps.","","978-1-4673-8148-2;9781467381482","","10.1109/CloudTech.2015.7336967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336967","Cloud computing;Cloud security;Intrusion detection/prevention system;Multi-criteria decision analysis","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Databases;Decision making;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","cloud computing;risk management;security of data","IDS architectures;IT service;MacBeth;cloud computing environments;intrusion detection architectures;intrusion detection systems;measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique;multicriteria analysis;multicriteria decision analysis;risk minimization;security challenges","","","","15","","","2-4 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.","","","","10.1109/EDCC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950","IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring","Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters","embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management","SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem","","","","47","","","7-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once a computer is compromised, an attacker may alter files, add new files or delete existing files. The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise. Three types of attacker action are considered: reconnaissance, password modification, and malware download. For each type of action, we evaluated the files to audit using metrics derived from the field of information theory and estimated with the empirical SSH compromise data.","","978-0-7695-3698-9;9780769536989","978-0-7695-3698-9;9780769536989","10.1109/NCA.2009.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190368","Intrusion detection systems;SSH compromise;attacker behavior;empirical analysis;filesystem data;honeypots","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Event detection;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Reconnaissance;Software tools;USA Councils","Bayes methods;authorisation;entropy;file organisation;invasive software;meta data;optimisation;probability","Bayesian metric;data auditing;empirical SSH compromise data;entropy-based metric;file evaluation;filesystem attack activity;filesystem data monitoring;honeypot;information theory;intrusion detection system;malware download;meta data;optimization problem;password modification;probability;reconnaissance action;unauthorized user","","0","","29","","","9-11 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

In this paper, we present a malicious nodes detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, Merkle tree hashing technique. In our defense techniques we have two stages. The first stage is to detect the attack, and the second stage is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature. Simulation results show this robust mechanism achieves a very high accuracy and detection rate.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396496","Denial-of-Service;Malicious Node Detection;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attacks;Security","Australia;Electronic mail;Information technology;Network coding;Routing;Security;Wireless communication","computer network security;cryptography","Merkle tree hashing technique;acknowledgement based mechanisms;destination nodes;malicious node traceback;malicious nodes detection mechanism;networks coding based mechanism;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attack;source nodes","","","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4673-0228-9;9781467302289","978-1-4673-0227-2;9781467302272","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders becoming smarter in obfuscating web requests to evade detection combined with increasing volumes of web traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-hosted and on-premise business applications have made it evident that the existing approaches of mostly static signature lack the ability to cope with novel signatures. A SQLIA detection and prevention solution can be achieved through exploring an alternative bio-inspired supervised learning approach that uses input of labelled dataset of numerical attributes in classifying true positives and negatives. We present in this paper a Numerical Encoding to Tame SQLIA (NETsQlIA) that implements a proof of concept for scalable numerical encoding of features to a dataset attributes with labelled class obtained from deep web traffic analysis. In the numerical attributes encoding: the model leverages proxy in the interception and decryption of web traffic. The intercepted web requests are then assembled for front-end SQL parsing and pattern matching by applying traditional Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This paper is intended for a technique of numerical attributes extraction of any size primed as an input dataset to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented using Two-Class Averaged Perceptron (TCAP) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TCLR) respectively.

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These metrics help derive a level of assurance that will support security management decisions, enhance effective remediation efforts, and could serve as security tool design metrics.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2075926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5570991","Confidence level;Fuzzy classifiers;scanner;vulnerability;web application","Classification algorithms;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Software","Internet;fuzzy set theory;neural nets;pattern classification;security of data;software metrics;software reliability","Web application scanners;fuzzy classification metrics;information security;scanner assessment;security management decisions;security tool design metrics;soft computing technology;vulnerability reporting","","4","","24","","2010-09-13","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Advances in computing performance, in terms of processing power and storage, have allowed the use of resource-intensive intelligent algorithms, to detect intrusive activities, in a timely manner. Naive Bayes is a statistical inference learning algorithm with promise for document classification, spam detection and intrusion detection. The attribute independence issue associated with Naive Bayes has been resolved through the development of the Average One Dependence Estimator (AODE) algorithm. In this paper, we propose the application of AODE for intrusion detection. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied and analyzed on the KDD-99 intrusion benchmark data set. With a detection rate of 99.7%, AODE outperformed Naive Bayes, which reported a detection rate of 97.3%, and a larger number of false positives.","","978-1-4244-8879-7;9781424488797","978-0-9564263-7-6;9780956426376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5749877","","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training","Bayes methods;Internet;computer network security;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;unsolicited e-mail","AODE based intrusion detection system;Internet;average one dependence estimator algorithm;computer network;document classification;intrusive activity detection;naive Bayes;resource intensive intelligent algorithm;security researcher;spam detection;statistical inference learning algorithm","","0","","23","","","21-23 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VoIP networks are a popular, low-cost alternative for telephony that offer lower rates especially for long-distance calls. Other services such as FollowMe, enhance the traditional voice-oriented nature of these networks. Consequently several security concerns such as fraud calls, are related to the high availability required by a VoIP system. Fraud calls account for an average loss of 3% to 5% of the operators' revenue. Thus the detection and prevention of the users from behaving in a non-conforming way, becomes crucial. A trustworthy and secure management and billing scheme is necessary, to guarantee the proper operation. This work proposes a behavioral control scheme for the VoIP clients. An initial training period defines the normal behavior. Then statistical analysis and t-testing is employed to extract results regarding the users' profiles, with pre-defined confidence levels. A Buffer zone creates a more flexible decision-making process. The scheme also offers the ability to configure its parameters, in order to react appropriately under different network conditions and detect possible misuses. It is implemented and its rational operation is verified via several simulation scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511103","Intrusion Detection System;T-testing;VoIP fraud detection;non-conforming behaviour;security","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Quality of service;Statistical analysis;Training","Internet telephony;decision making;statistical analysis","VoIP-based network systems;decision-making process;hypothesis testing;nonconforming behavior detection;statistical analysis;t-testing","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To test our model we use the NSL-KDD data set and empirically prove that Levy flights can upgrade the exploration of standard Binary Bat Algorithm.

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type opportunistic adversaries. This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions. Experimental results show that our algorithm has higher detection accuracy than other approaches based on outlier detection or change-point detection.","2166-0778;21660778","978-1-4673-2318-5;9781467323185","978-0-7695-4770-1;9780769547701","10.1109/SRII.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310988","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Opportunistic adversary","Automation;Business;Decision trees;Humans;Insurance;Machine learning;Training","business data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","change-point detection;countermeasure algorithm;human decision processes;imminent threats;machine-learning-based business process automation;misclassification cases;opportunistic adversaries;outlier detection;post-classification data distributions;real-world classification problems;reduced classification accuracy","","0","","20","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level.

In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

"ARSoS: An Adaptive, Robust, and Sub-Optimal Strategy for Automated Deployment of Anomaly Detection System in MANETs","Z. Zhang; F. Nait-Abdesselam; S. Djahel","LIFL, Univ. of Sci. & Technol. of Lille, Lille","2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","20080815","2008","","","606","613","While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem.

"Towards ground truthing observations in gray-box anomaly detection","J. Ming; H. Zhang; D.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1;9781457704581","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS are an effective way to detect different kinds of attacks in an interconnected network thereby securing the network. An effective Intrusion Detection System requires high accuracy and detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper.

For example, the state space may be restricted by considering only a call graph, thus reducing accuracy and precision. In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. We use Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect network intrusions. First, packets are captured from the network, RST is used to pre-process the data and reduce the dimensions. The features selected by RST will be sent to SVM model to learn and test respectively.

Most of this profile data is currently based on command-line instructions/directives executed by users on a system. With the advent and extensive usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line data can no longer fully represent user's complete behavior which is essential for effectively detecting the anomalies in these GUI based systems. Collection of user behavior data is a slow and time consuming process. In this paper, we present a new approach to automate the generation of user data by parameterizing user behavior in terms of user intention (malicious/normal), user skill level, set of applications installed on a machine, mouse movement and keyboard activity. The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized. The framework is called USim which can achieve rapid generation of user behavior data based on these templates for GUI based systems. The data thus generated can be utilized for rapidly training and testing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and improving their detection precision.","1080-241X;1080241X","0-7695-2559-8;0769525598","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612860","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data engineering;Discrete event simulation;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Keyboards;Laboratories;Mice;System testing","graphical user interfaces;security of data","IDSes;USim;anomaly detection system;graphical user interface;intrusion detection system;user behavior simulation","","1","1","25","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4673-4942-0;9781467349420","978-1-4673-4940-6;9781467349406","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems are an effective way to detect malicious connections in a computer network. To get there, they classifies the connections as normal or abnormal, using different algorithms. In this paper three methods are used, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the two-stage algorithm PCA+LDA as related works, and the Direct Linear Discriminant analysis (D-LDA) algorithm as a proposed method. The PCA step in the PCA+LDA algorithm eliminates the problem of singularity but the PCA criterion is not compatible with the LDA criterion and thus may discard the important discriminative information, unlike the D-LDA algorithm which keeps them and gets rid of the singularity problem. In this work, we propose its implementation for intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in terms of detection accuracy rate which is 97.75%.","","","","10.1109/ICoCS.2015.7483227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483227","Intrusion detection system;KDDCup99;direct linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Euclidean distance;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis","computer network security;principal component analysis","D-LDA algorithm;IT security;bank data;computer network;cyber attacks;direct LDA;direct linear discriminant analysis algorithm;governmental data;malicious connection detection;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;singularity problem;two-stage algorithm PCA-LDA","","","","9","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DSC can detect zero-day scanning worms with a high detection rate and very low false positive rate. (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of early worm warning based on local victim information.

Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance.

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.
