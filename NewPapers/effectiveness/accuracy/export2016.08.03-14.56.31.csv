AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

Mainly, some trust management basis may be exploited to fulfill new attacks. In this work, we present a holistic view on various trust management frameworks geared for MANETs, capable to handle main existing attacks deceiving trustworthiness computation to mislead trust-based network operations, referred to as trust-distortion attacks. Besides, we propose a taxonomy of main identified trust-distortion attacks based on how the trustworthiness estimation of a node about another node is distorted. Moreover, we provide a holistic classification of main evaluation metrics, which can be used to evaluate and compare such frameworks. For each framework, a unified approach is used to describe the trust model, taking each component required for trust management as a guideline.

With the introduction of additional technology within the aircraft, mere human perception may not be sufficient to make a decision. In this research work, the authors explore the possibility of implementing a smart video surveillance system (SVSS) within the aircraft that is tuned toward detecting the behavioral anomaly within the aircraft. The SVSS will generate security triggers when it detects an anomaly within the aircraft.

Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","8","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To devise effective countermeasures, it is crucial to know how attacks on these systems are performed in reality. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45 day field test with 13 observation points. These results confirm the advantages of a widely distributed monitoring setup and give some new insights into the behavior of the attackers.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857088","Honeynet;Honeypot;Nornet;SIP;STR;Sensor;Toll Fraud;VoIP;fraud;misuse;misuse detection;security","Internet;Monitoring;Registers;Security;Servers;Software;Standards","Internet telephony;security of data;signalling protocols","China;Germany;Internet;Norway;SIP-based attacks;Session Initiation Protocol;VoIP system;distributed infrastructure;distributed monitoring system;sensor nodes","","1","","24","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the developed system, home users equipped with PDAs may locally and remotely receive the alert of home intrusion with captured subject image. There are two key components developed in this system. One is the intrusion image processing (IIP) to recognize the intrusion and extract the intrusion subject. The other is the universal-plug-and-play (UPnP-based) instant messaging (UIM) The proposed IIP employs a modified three-step search (TSS) to improve the accuracy of the subject identification. Through the integrating of the two software component, intelligent intrusion detection is capable of offering a smart home security system. The implementation results show the accuracy of subject identification is about 90%~100%, depending on the granulity of the subject searching.

In this paper, an autonomic monitoring framework for the web service-enabled application software is proposed. Software resources are web service-enabled on the basis of elastic hardware resources???physical machines or virtual machines. Both of the software services and underlying hardware resources are dynamically monitored. An autonomic monitoring algorithm with self-optimized updating period and self-adaptive event-driven update is also given for the dynamic information retrieving of software services and underlying hardware resources.

Our proposal, the IBW Framework, includes an approach for security in WMN detecting and mitigating the attacks through the use of non-relational databases for the data correlation and the dissemination of intrusion information among the nodes in WMN to reduce the amount of attacks in short time. Data correlation is done from the log data of servers and distributed Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDSs & IPSs) using syslog information with a particular format. Intrusion Prevention Systems can be implemented with any kind of solution, in our case we proposed iptables.

Thus, to improve the current mitigation solution, this study intents to proposethe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the mitigation rules approach to mitigate the ICMP attack. The mitigation rules are developed specifically to mitigate the ICMP attack and to suppress the number of false alarms. Project implementation is done using Snort, which is installed in the Linux platform. For evaluation purpose, testing is carried out with live private data in identical environment, with the default rules and the proposed mitigation rules enabled in the same LAN. Experimental result shows that deployment of mitigation rules is 63.95% efficient to mitigate the ICMP attack compared to the original Snort rules.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836547","DDoS Attack;ICMP Attack;IDS;Mitigation Rules","Availability;Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Syntactics;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","Internet;Linux;computer network security;local area networks;protocols","DDoS attack;ICMP attack mitigation;IDS;Internet control message protocol attack;LAN;Linux platform;Snort;intrusion detection system;mitigation rule approach;resource availability","","0","","22","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902777","Network traffic analysis;network traffic identification;protocol reverse engineering;unsupervised information extraction","Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Redundancy","Internet;computer network management;protocols;unsupervised learning","ProWord approach;application protocols;common string;deep packet analysis rules;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram;network management system;network measurement system;network security system;ranking algorithm;traffic payload;unsupervised protocol feature word extraction;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting experts algorithm","","1","","44","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2;9781424499052","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically we perform anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529343","privacy-enhanced security data sharing","Access control;Automation;Collaboration;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Pattern analysis;Protection;Risk analysis","data privacy;security of data","anonymized packet traces;distributed security analysis;intrusion detection system alarms;network data;privacy protection;security analysis capability","","0","","32","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system. Evaluation on Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network corpus shows higher detection accuracy at 87% compare to 56% for Snort signatures. Moreover, false negative reduces to 14% compared to 78% for Snort signatures.","","978-1-4244-8647-2;9781424486472","","10.1109/SCORED.2010.5703974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703974","Signatures generation;behavioural approach;intrusion detection system;rapid malcode","","Internet;alarm systems;behavioural sciences;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;Snort signature;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network;automated malcode signatures generation;automatic signature generation technique;legitimate traffic block;malicious code;selfreplicating malicious program;signature based firewalls network intrusion detection system;signature based malcode detector;signature based tool;sound vulnerability signature;warning system","","0","","24","","","13-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets.

Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands.

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","2155-5486;21555486","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications.

Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern.

Still, significant challenges exist in design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labour intensive and complex engineering endeavour.

An organization with hundreds of workstations does not necessarily imply that it has the opportunity to form an ad-hoc computer cluster because different workstations may have different turned-on durations and these workstations may not be available at the same time depending on their users' usage. The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations. The contribution of this work is the creation of a framework that allows administrators to identify potential workstations for forming ad-hoc computer clusters of their environment.","","978-1-4799-4556-6;9781479945566","","10.1109/I4CT.2014.6914181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914181","Distributed Systems;Resource Management;Resource Monitoring;Resource Prediction","Clouds;Distributed computing;Monitoring;Organizations;Prediction methods;Workstations","workstation clusters","ad-hoc computer clusters;time 42 day;turned-on patterns;workstations uptime analysis framework","","0","","27","","","2-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357562","HTTP;TCP;big data;chat;documents;email;insider threat;machine learning;support vector machine;trust;usage patterns","Access control;Big data;Computer security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Monitoring","Big Data;authorisation;data analysis;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trusted computing","BBAC;English text exchanges;HTTP requests;actor trustworthiness;behavior-based access control;big data analytics;big data batch processing;chat messages;classifier training;clustering analysis;document trustworthiness;emails;enterprise environments;information trustworthiness;insider threat detection;interconnected systems;machine learning;mal-behavior;network connections;real-time stream processing;security events;statistical classification","","","","37","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy.

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections.

The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/65.283931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=283931","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems","computer networks;network operating systems;open systems;security of data;telecommunication network management","abuse;audit trails;heterogeneous computer networks;host-based IDS;intruder behavior;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;monitored network traffic;network-based IDS;open mode;rulebased misuse models;security;statistical anomaly;unauthorized actions;unauthorized use","","163","81","36","","","May-June 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail.

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","J. T. L. Ho; G. G. F. Lemieux","University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2;9781424437832","978-1-4244-2796-3;9781424427963","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","3","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3;9781467311083","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider the security ramifications of crowdsourcing of spectrum sensing in presence of malicious users that report false measurements. We propose viewing the area of interest as a grid of square cells and using it to identify and disregard false measurements. The proposed mechanism is based on identifying outlier measurements inside each cell, as well as corroboration among neighboring cells in a hierarchical structure to identify cells with significant number of malicious nodes. We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers.

During the operational phase each incoming network packet is evaluated by the learning algorithm and the payload is declared as normal or anomalous based on the patterns previously learnt.

The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches. Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state.

In our approach, patterns of normal and intrusive activities are learned through finite generalized Dirichlet mixture models, in the context of Bayesian variational inference. Under the proposed variational framework, the parameters, the complexity of the mixture model, and the features saliency can be estimated simultaneously, in a closed-form.

However even though market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact to overall system cost. How the synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length is presented. For a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is sub-divided into up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
