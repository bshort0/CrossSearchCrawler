In this paper we present the architecture of a system for the detection and management of emergencies in smart buildings. The designed architecture shows some novelties and key features which distinguish it from already existing solutions. Indeed, the proposed architecture exploits the existing building management systems leveraging mobile crowd sensing to collect valuable information during a crisis.

The big data processing is done through HAMR, which is a next generation in-memory MapReduce engine. HAMR has reported high speedups over existing big data solutions across several analytics algorithms. The analytics engine comprises a novel ensemble algorithm, which extracts training data from clusters of the multiple IDS alarms. The clustering is utilized as a preprocessing step to re-label the datasets based on their high similarity to known potential attacks.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset. We demonstrate why this is the case by statistical analysis of our dataset, and furthermore, present feature reduction techniques to enhance the classification performance of existing classification schemes on our dataset.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4244-8705-9;9781424487059","978-1-4244-8703-5;9781424487035","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720662","","Computer crime;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms","Internet;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;statistical analysis","Euclidean distance;Internet;anomalous message;anomaly detection;classification system;encryption;feature reduction technique;multimedia session establishment protocol;self learning system;session initiation protocol;statistical analysis","","8","1","20","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, attackers have exploited state-of-the-art techniques to evade these detection systems, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, making existing systems ineffective.

It uses improved reverse sequential hypothesis testing (RSHT) to detect portscans which are routinely used to find vulnerable hosts to compromise.

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, denial of service (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach cross layer based intrusion detection system(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

In addition to the conventional approach of human interactive proofs such as CAPTCHAs, a more recent approach of human observational proofs (HOP) has been developed to automatically distinguish web bots from human users. Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites.

Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA). This paper describes a novel BPA methodology able to automatically adapt its detection capabilities to the current measured characteristics, with a light weight process of generating a baseline profile of normal utilisation and without intervention from the IDS administrator.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, the main principle of the proposed architecture is based on: (a) the distribution which is achieved through the implementation of a local intrusion detection system on each network node, and (b) the cooperation that is guaranteed by mobile and stationary agents' collaboration. In that way we were able to have an IDS with so many interesting features such as: flexibility, distribution and cooperation, autonomy, lightweight, reactivity and fault tolerance which are extremely desired for any MANET intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-0798-7;9781467307987","","10.1109/ITNG.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209126","distributed and cooperative;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent system","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multiagent systems","computer network security;groupware;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;multi-agent systems","IDS;MANET intrusion detection system;MASID;agent-based detection process;cooperative architecture;distributed architecture;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile-stationary agent collaboration;multiagent system;network node","","2","","12","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection method based on parallel SVM is proposed and a detection model system is constructed in this paper. First, original training dataset gained from network is divided into three subsets according to the network protocol (TCP, UDP and ICMP). Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set. The experiment results show that the training time of SVM is shortened and the detection accuracy obtained by our method is exactly same as that obtained by others.","","978-1-4244-5227-9;9781424452279","978-1-4244-5228-6;9781424452286","10.1109/JCPC.2009.5420129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420129","","Data security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Parallel algorithms;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Support vector machines;Ubiquitous computing","groupware;parallel algorithms;protocols;security of data;support vector machines;ubiquitous computing","cooperative intrusion detection system;high speed network;large scale network;learning algorithm;network protocol;parallel SVM;pervasive computing;support vector machine","","0","","7","","","3-5 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates.

This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches.

Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, why six? accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the why six issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values.

RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently. On the basis of the extracted rules, the multi-feature space is projected into a two-dimensional average matching degree space.

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2;9781479950782","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the general server, once the cloud environment suffered from malicious attacks, people or companies will get caught in extreme dangers. Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs. In our system, facing a great deal of network traffic, the administrator can accurately recognize intruders' intentions and learn about the attack probabilities and network security situations.","","","","10.1109/ASIAJCIS.2013.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621650","Bayesian network;Feature Wight Matrix;alert correlation;cloud environment;intrusion detection system","Bayes methods;Correlation;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection","Bayes methods;belief networks;cloud computing;data analysis;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","Bayesian network;adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system;alert correlation matrix;alert correlation probability;alert data analysis;attack graphs;attack probability;attack techniques;cloud environment;feature weight matrix;high level attack strategy;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;malicious packets;network security;network traffic","","0","","7","","","25-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sabotaging the quality of the results retrieved by search engines can lead users to doubt the search engine provider. Spam websites can serve as means of phishing. This paper shows a spam host detection approach that uses support vector machines(SVM) for classification. We create a parallel version of standard Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to determine free parameters of the SVM classifier and apply our proposed model to a content web spamming dataset, WEBSPAM-UK2011. Our implementation of the parallel PSO is constructed on a pool of threads and each thread executes tasks associated to a particle from the swarm. Experiments showed that our proposed model can achieve a higher accuracy than regular SVM and outperforms other classifiers (C4.5, Naive Bayes). Furthermore, parallel version of standard Particle Swam Optimization(PSO) can efficiently select parameters for SVM.","","978-1-4799-3731-8;9781479937318","","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857840","Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machine;parallelism;spam host","Accuracy;Kernel;Particle swarm optimization;Sensitivity;Standards;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;Web sites;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;search engines;security of data;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;PSO;SVM;Web spamming dataset;particle swarm optimization;phishing;search engines;spam Websites;spam host classification;spam host detection;support vector machines","","0","","18","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors. Obtained models can then be enhanced with extra requirements such as resources usage limits or temporal execution bounds by means of observers.

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These technologies have support of one of famous technique known as Adhoc Network. Adhoc Networks are assortment of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and also receiving attention in the scientific community. In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account. Proposed method optimizes the routing issues by using AODV.

None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling).

However, they tend to show good performance on off-line data and their accuracy drop when they are deployed to realtime intrusion detection systems that receive data streams constantly. In other words, the problem with a conventional classifier model, when applied to realtime detection systems, is that it is likely to perform poorly against new data that is different from the patterns against which the model was trained. This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data. The performance of the system is constantly monitored and whenever it drops under a certain level of accuracy, the classifier model is retrained to learn new patterns and eliminate the obsolete ones from its knowledge. Further, the framework uses a semi rule-based approach to classification in order to make the model more understandable for human experts and facilitate the user interference in the learning process.","","978-1-4673-1420-6;9781467314206","","10.1109/CYBER.2012.6392538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392538","","Accuracy;Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;user interfaces","adaptive classification framework;classification algorithm;classifier model;cyberinfrastructure;cybersecurity;data mining method;incremental semi rule-based learning model;realtime intrusion detection system;user interference","","0","","13","","","27-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A recent survey has indicated that around 80 percent of attacks originate in the application layer.

In the algorithm, we consider the importance of nodes and the influence between nodes. Moreover, we represent the importance of nodes' topological position with bridge connection coefficient, and takes degree of interaction between nodes into account. The mutual information value of node is determined and regarded as selection condition of monitor node. In order to allocate the range of monitor node efficiently, we introduce linear threshold model in the social network and consider similarity of node is as influence edge weight. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce system cost, ensure the accuracy of intrusion detection system and improve the network performance compared with the traditional node section schemes.","","978-1-5090-1892-5;9781509018925","","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463750","Monitor node selection;mutual information;node influence;social network analysis","Bridges;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Mutual information;Routing;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","IDS;bridge connection coefficient;interaction degree;intrusion detection system;linear threshold model;monitor node selection algorithm;mutual information;node similarity;node topological position;security mechanism;social network;wireless mesh networks","","","","11","","","19-21 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, the transmission accuracy of wireless communications suffers from radio irregularities caused by obstacles such as human bodies in the environment. The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity. Moreover, the detection algorithm can be implemented in software without modifying the existing infrastructure.

Much research has been conducted in the multi-stage detection area, in order to build a framework based on an events correlation approach. This paper proposes a framework that predicts multi-stage attacks based on a different approach, which is an IP information evaluation. This approach was chosen after analysing three different multi-stage attack scenarios. This paper shows the analysis of those scenarios, detailing their steps and information hitherto unexploited in current intrusion detection systems.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0;9781479927630","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.

Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly.

"Detecting selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks","Bo Yu; Bin Xiao","Dept. of Comput., Hong Kong Polytech. Univ., China","Proceedings 20th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","20060626","2006","","","8 pp.","","Selective forwarding attacks may corrupt some mission-critical applications such as military surveillance and forest fire monitoring. In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes.

Port scanning is one of the dangerous attacks that intrusion detection tries to detect. Snort, a famous network intrusion detection system (NIDS), detects a port scanning attack by combining and analyzing various traffic parameters. Because these parameters cannot be easily combined using a mathematical formula, fuzzy logic can be used to combine them; fuzzy logic can also reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, to detect port scanning attacks. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and integrated with Snort in order to enhance the functionality of port scanning detection. Experiments are carried out in both wired and wireless networks. The results show that applying fuzzy logic adds to the accuracy of determining bad traffic. Moreover, it gives a level of degree for each type of port scanning attack.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-2201-2;9781424422012","978-1-4244-2202-9;9781424422029","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599918","","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Wireless networks","fuzzy control;security of data","fuzzy logic controller;network intrusion detection system;port scanning","","3","","16","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process steps of false positive elimination were clearly described, and additionally, two typical clustering algorithms, the K-means algorithm and the FCM algorithm, were implemented for false alerts identification and filtration. Also, we defined three evaluation indexes: the elimination rate, the false elimination rate and the miss elimination rate. Accordingly, we used DARPA 2000 LLDOS1.0 dataset for our experiments, and adopted Snort as our intrusion detection system.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current.

We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities. We find that the performance for both detectors degrades as shown by their Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves when intra-cloud live migration is initiated while VMs are under a netscan (NS) or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2014.6968968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968968","Cloud computing;anomaly detection;live VM migration","Computer crime;Conferences;Detectors;Entropy;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Vectors","cloud computing;computer network security;virtual machines","K-means;PCA;ROC curves;anomaly detection;denial-of-service attack;intracloud live migration;live intracloud virtual-machine migration;netscan;receiver operating characteristic curves;resource management;security issues;virtualized cloud environments","","2","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM.

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers.

It is challenging to construct a secure networking environment in clouds because the cloud is usually a hybrid networking system containing both physical and virtually overlaid networks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) have been widely deployed to manipulate cloud security, with the latter providing additional prevention capabilities. This paper investigates into an OpenFlow and Snort based IPS called SnortFlow, in which it enables the cloud system to detect intrusions and deploy countermeasures by reconfiguring the cloud networking system on-the-fly. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of SnortFlow and provide the guidance for the future work.","","","","10.1109/GREE.2013.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601422","","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Servers","cloud computing;overlay networks;security of data","IDS;IPS;OpenFlow-based intrusion prevention system;SnortFlow;cloud computing;cloud networking system on-the-fly;cloud security;hybrid networking system;intrusion detection systems;physical overlaid networks;secure networking environment;virtually overlaid networks","","7","","17","","","20-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Novel Approach for Single-Packet IP Traceback Based on Routing Path","N. Lu; Y. Wang; F. Yang; M.

This paper proposes a novel single-packet IP trace back approach based on the routing path to alleviate the burden of routers. Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.","1066-6192;10666192","978-1-4673-0226-5;9781467302265","","10.1109/PDP.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557","","Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches","IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing","HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path","","1","","14","","","15-17 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
