Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters. The system successfully prevented 92.96% SQL Injection attacks, 79.86% XSS attacks without impacting server operations.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019679","IPAAS;SQl injection Attack;Web application;XSS Attack","Intrusion detection;Protocols;Servers;Software;Syntactics;Training","Internet;SQL;computer crime;hypermedia;program verification","HTTP parameter type verification;HTTP stateless;IPAAS;Internet;SQL injection attacks;SQL statements;Web application attackers;Web application programming language;Web application vulnerabilities;Web applications performance;XSS;anomaly intrusion detection system;attack patterns;attacking tool;automated parameter pollution verification;browser software;client/server;code modification;code verification;input type validation vulnerabilities prevention;network based intrusion detection systems;network level;online verification;sanity checks;server operations;software vulnerabilities;syntax analyzers;unpublished vulnerabilities","","3","","21","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918856","digital world;electronic circuit;rough set","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Electronic circuits;Logic gates;Set theory","logic gates;rough set theory","artificial intelligence based approach;circuit miniaturization;decision rules;electronic circuit;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, four open source regular expression match engines are introduced, include Henry Spencer's regex library, PCRE, RE2, and TRE. An evaluation of the four libraries on expressive power, data structure, memory usage and performance is proposed. The evaluation is based on analysis of their source code and black-box testing. Also a list of benchmarks is presented to do this evaluation. The results indicate that PCRE supports more features but has worse performance than other libraries, RE2 performs well on both time and memory usage but does not support backreferences.

The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic.

One of the researches introduced a fast method to detect attacks using modified information entropy (so called Fast Entropy). Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme. In addition, we found that Dynamic AFEA can enhance detection level more than fixed (non-dynamic) one when it is equipped with Fast Entropy.","","978-1-61284-733-7;9781612847337","978-0-7695-4372-7;9780769543727","10.1109/IMIS.2011.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976144","DDoS;Dynamic Adaptive Detector;Entropy based approach;Fast Infromatin Entropy","Accuracy;Computer crime;Detectors;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring","Internet;entropy;security of data","Internet;adaptive DDoS attack detection using fast entropy approach;adaptive threshold shifting;distributed denial-of-service attacks;dynamic detection window size","","1","","11","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenges are how to increase the accuracy of detection and how to visualize and present flood attack patterns in networks for early detection. In this paper, we propose a Two-Layer density model for flood attack detection. The first density layer describes sending-density and receiving-density in analyzing Internet traffic. The second density layer describes attack-density and normal-density in analyzing local network traffic at a victim site. Several visualization techniques are used to facilitate the detection process.

But, the plug-in-and-play architecture of WMNs paves way for malicious users who could exploit some loopholes of the underlying routing protocol. A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network.

Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3919-5;9780769539195","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","4","1","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the networks the worm may consist of some list of vulnerable in particular targeted network. While the targeted hosts occurs it start propagates rapidly using the list. This factor may lead to the transactions terminal and it cannot guarantee for safety. Most detecting methods don't detect the worms in effective manner.

The stages are stable, vulnerable presence, exploit and zombie. By using this we can easily identify the worms and it can be detected. Intrusion detection method performs a major task.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8;9781424483358","978-0-7695-4214-0;9780769542140","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many studies have been done on cloud computing security issues, but research into VM security issues, especially regarding VM network traffic anomalous behavior detection, remains inadequate. More and more studies show that communication among internal nodes exhibits complex patterns. Communication among VMs in cloud computing is invisible. Researchers find such issues challenging, and few solutions have been proposed???leaving cloud computing vulnerable to network attacks. This paper proposes a model that uses Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to implement traffic redirection. Our model can capture inter-VM traffic, detect known and unknown anomalous network behaviors, adopt hybrid techniques to analyze VM network behaviors, and control network systems.

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.

Experimental results show that FHNN is faster than other methods and it is very efficient in tacking noise from majority class examples.","","978-1-4244-7506-3;9781424475063","978-1-4244-7507-0;9781424475070","10.1109/ICIE.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571319","Adaboost Algorithm;Neighborhood cleaning rule;imbalanced data;network intrusion detection;resampling methods","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Nearest neighbor searches;Sampling methods;Testing;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;sampling methods;security of data","fast hierarchical nearest neighbor;high-speed network intrusion detection system;load balancing model;resampling method","","0","","8","","","14-15 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines the spread of a class of hitlist-based worms that attempt to propagate by searching for address book files on the host system and using the host's mail program to spread to the addresses found. This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms.

However, IDSs generate a high amount of false alerts exceeding the administrator ability for analysis and omit several attacks which can threaten the network security. In this paper, a two-stage process based on data mining and optimization is proposed having as input the outcome of multiple IDSs. In the first stage, for each IDS the set of elementary alerts is clustered to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove false positives from the sets of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the second stage, we discard the meta-alerts generated by all IDSs and only those missed by one, two or most of them are left. This set is called the set of potential false negatives. In fact, at this level a meta-alerts fusion is performed to avoid the redundancy between meta-alerts collected from multiple IDSs. Finally, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify the potential false negatives either as real attacks or not. Experimental results show that our proposed process outperforms concurrent methods by significantly reducing the rate of false positives and false negatives.","","978-1-4673-8659-3;9781467386593","","10.1109/CIS.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397096","binary classification;binary optimization;clustering;false negatives;false positives;intrusion detection systems","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Redundancy;Security;Testing;Training","computer network security;data mining;optimisation;pattern classification","IDS;binary classification algorithm;binary optimization problem;computer network protection;computer network security;data mining;elementary alerts;false alerts;false negative identification;false positive identification;intrusion detection systems;meta-alert fusion;security infrastructure;two-stage process","","","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method is based on the inherent feature of the TCP protocol, that is, two communicating peers keep synchronized with each other using data acknowledgment. This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions. To these ends the Session Aggregation for Network Traffic Analysis (SANTA) dataset is proposed.

We also point out open issues in file-sharing workload characterization and suggest novel approaches to workload studies.","","0-7695-2269-6;0769522696","","10.1109/PTPSYS.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376617","","Analytical models;Fault tolerant systems;Information analysis;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Performance analysis;Protocols;Spine;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","peer-to-peer computing;performance evaluation;resource allocation","data collection;peer-to-peer file sharing network;peer-to-peer workload characterization;performance evaluation","","2","","20","","","8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Abnormal behaviors or activities on the network systems could be detected by security systems. But, conventional security systems such as anti-virus and firewall cannot be successful in many malicious actions. To overcome this problem, better and more intelligent IDS solutions are required. In this study, a hybrid approach was proposed to use to detect network attacks. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods were combined to model and detect the attacks. KNN was employed to classify the attacks and GA was used to select k neighbors of an attack sample. This hybrid system was first applied in intrusion detection field. The system provides advantages such as, decreasing dependency of full training data set and providing plausible solution for intrusion detection. The results showed that the proposed system provides better results than single system.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424302","Intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;k-nearest neighbor;network attacks","Biological cells;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Support vector machines;Training","firewalls;genetic algorithms;pattern recognition","GA;KNN methods;anti-virus;firewall;genetic algorithm;hybrid method;hybrid system;information systems;intelligent IDS solutions;intrusion detection field;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor;malicious actions;security systems","","","","33","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates. Our experiments report a very good performance with very high detection rate and low false detection rate when using carefully selected parameter values.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066459","Stepping-stone;connection chain;data mining;intrusion detection;network security","Association rules;Computer security;Cryptography;Data mining;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Timing jitter","Internet;data mining;security of data;telecommunication network routing","Internet;evasion technique;false detection rate;modified association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;network routing;stepping-stone connection detection","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present our technique, Sania, for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web applications during the development and debugging phases. Sania intercepts the SQL queries between a Web application and a database, and automatically generates elaborate attacks according to the syntax and semantics of the potentially vulnerable spots in the SQL queries. In addition, Sania compares the parse trees of the intended SQL query and those resulting after an attack to assess the safety of these spots.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4;9781479930784","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","1","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy.

Consequently, it is difficult for administrators to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. Several alert correlation methods have been proposed. However, these methods don't consider the differences in reliability among alerts reported from multiple IDSs. This paper presents a novel alert correlation approach based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which regards the alerts as evidence of network attack and combines all the evidence according to the Dempster's combination rule, inferring whether the attack has taken place. The main advantage of the approach is that it can eliminate the ambiguity and confliction in alerts and reduce the number of alerts. With the DARPA 2000 test dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can reduce more than 69% of reported alerts and decrease the false positive rate efficiently.","","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469406","D-S evidence theory;alert correlation;intrsion detection system;network security","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Data security;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Testing","computer networks;correlation methods;security of data;telecommunication security","Dempste combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;intrusion alert correlation method;intrusion detection systems;network attack","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile radio;network topology;telecommunication security","automatic retaliation;hacking;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;security mechanisms;wireless ad hoc networks","","114","4","13","","","Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-2308-8;9781424423088","978-1-4244-2309-5;9781424423095","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous fault-tolerant approaches have been proposed to effectively achieve this objective in the presence of crash failures. However, such systems struggle with transient late-timing faults -- a fault classification challenging to effectively tolerate -- that manifests increasingly within large-scale distributed systems. Such faults represent a significant threat towards minimizing soft real-time execution of streaming applications in the presence of failures. This work proposes a fault-tolerant approach for QoS-aware data prediction to tolerate transient late-timing faults. The approach is capable of determining the most effective data prediction algorithm for imposed QoS constraints on a failed stream processor at run-time. We integrated our approach into Apache Storm with experiment results showing its ability to minimize stream processor end-to-end execution time by 61% compared to other fault-tolerant approaches. The approach incurs 12% additional CPU utilization while reducing network usage by 44%.","","","","10.1109/ISORC.2016.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515618","Cloud computing;Data Prediction;Fault-tolerance;Stream Processing","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","17-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3;9781424417513","","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment.

We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device.

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391","","Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software","Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities","","0","","27","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experiment results show that this technique is superior to individual decision trees for intrusion detection in terms of classification accuracy.","2379-5352;23795352","0-7695-2405-2;0769524052","","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578909","","Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Data security;Decision trees;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Robustness","","","","3","","8","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
