This paper proposes a process for testing and validating intrusion models used in network intrusion detection. The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks. This experiment will indicate that when the testing and validation is part of the intrusion model development process, the intrusion model developer receives immediate feedback and can quickly refine the intrusion model.

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-4000-9;9781424440009","978-0-7695-3638-5;9780769536385","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","4","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavior of the system is defined in terms of a behavior set rather than using a single parameter. This facilitates greater accuracy in describing the behavior of the system and helps in reducing false-positives.

We firstly select the important features through binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and mutual information (MI) and get a dimension reduced dataset. SOM is used to cluster the dataset. PSO is used to evolve the weights for SOM to improve the clustering result.

The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4577-2027-7;9781457720277","978-1-4577-2026-0;9781457720260","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","2","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures.

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

Thus, IDS play a vital role in network security. Intrusion detection system tries to detect computer attacks by examining various data records, log audits etc. Many existing IDS such as Snort are signature based system. The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments. We observed that MLP Neural network requires large training time.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application.

Security threats could be one of the major stunning blocks on this evolution road. While system vendors and cloud tenants benefit much from sharing resources in the cloud environment, security breaches can cause more significant damages of the cloud ecosystem than personal computers. Virtualization techniques facilitate the movement of intrusion detection system to cloud-host operating systems with virtual machine management by observing behaviors of virtual machines (VMs). However, a VM-based detection system inherits the semantic gap problem: it is needed the ability to reveal (malicious) behaviors of VMs from observed data. We propose an automatic and systematic analysis framework for charactering malware behaviors using unsupervised clustering. This framework consists of three phases: (1) unsupervised clustering on behaviors of VMs, (2) supervised classification rule derivation, and (3) online system detection. Specifically, we collect and cluster system call distributions of VMs within a small period as samples, identify clusters that contain only samples from malicious VMs, and derive detection rules by extracting features of these malicious clusters. VMs that have been observed their system call distributions falling into a malicious cluster are considered to be malicious. We have integrated the presented framework with OpenStack and develop a prototype online monitoring system, called VISO. We conduct several experiments against common attacks, showing the effectiveness of VISO on clustering, classifying and detecting malicious behaviors of VMs.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396135","cloud security;clustering;virtual machine introspection","Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Malware;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;feature extraction;invasive software;pattern classification;pattern clustering;virtual machines;virtualisation","OpenStack;VISO;VM-based detection system;cloud computing;cloud-host operating systems;intrusion detection system;malicious cluster feature extraction;malware behaviors;online system detection;prototype online monitoring system;security breaches;semantic gap problem;supervised classification rule derivation;unsupervised clustering;virtual machine malicious behaviors;virtualization techniques","","","","51","","","Nov. 30 2015-Dec. 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","3","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) such as malware, rootkit, spyware, etc. are more potent to bypass the existing defense mechanisms designed for VM. To address this issue, Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) emerged as a promising approach that monitors run state of the VM externally from hypervisor. However, limitation of VMI lies with semantic gap. An open source tool called LibVMI address the semantic gap. Memory Forensic Analysis (MFA) tool such as Volatility can also be used to address the semantic gap. But, it needs to capture a memory dump (RAM) as input. Memory dump acquires time and its analysis time is highly crucial if Intrusion Detection System IDS (IDS) depends on the data supplied by FAM or VMI tool. In this work, live virtual machine RAM dump acquire time of LibVMI is measured. In addition, captured memory dump analysis time consumed by Volatility is measured and compared with other memory analyzer such as Rekall. It is observed through experimental results that, Rekall takes more execution time as compared to Volatility for most of the plugins. Further, Volatility and Rekall are compared with LibVMI. It is noticed that examining the volatile data through LibVMI is faster as it eliminates memory dump acquire time.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384310","Hypervisor;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Forensic Analysis;Rootkit;Semantic gap;Virtual Machine Introspection","Kernel;Malware;Random access memory;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","digital forensics;invasive software;public domain software;storage management;virtual machines;virtualisation","LibVMI open source tool;advanced persistent threats;captured memory dump analysis;execution time measurement;hypervisor;intrusion detection system;live virtual machine RAM dump;malware;memory forensic analysis tool;rootkit;semantic gap;spyware;virtual infrastructure privileged access;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine volatile artifact analyzers;virtualization environment","","","","28","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);Tutorials;application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","6","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1034-6;9781457710346","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine","Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines","Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine","","5","","20","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we identify properties of botnet communications that will not be obscured by these measures. This allows us to design features which can be derived by measuring these properties and used as input to an approach for detecting systems infected with a botnet client.

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as good or bad depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM learns the structure of the good and bad SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also real SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","1","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized.

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. This paper presents some results and reports the performance of generated fuzzy rules in classifying different types of intrusions.","","978-1-4244-8622-9;9781424486229","","10.1109/ITAIC.2011.6030165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030165","fuzzy classification;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Biological cells;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;security of data","DARPA data sets;Internet;anomaly based intrusion detection system;computer network;evolving fuzzy classifiers;false alarm rate;fuzzy inference engine;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithm;information security;information system;intrusive activity;intrusive behavior;network environment;prediction process;security risk","","1","","7","","","20-22 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5;0769524575","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","1","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even as the field marches forward, it does so with little understanding of the implications of publishing anonymized network data on the privacy of the networks being monitored and the utility to researchers. Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data. Addressing these challenges is essential, in our view, to ensure the continued, yet responsible, availability of network trace data to support security research.","","978-0-7695-3568-5;9780769535685","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804449","","Computer security;Data mining;Data privacy;Data security;Information security;Law;Legal factors;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Terrorism;Testing","data privacy","anonymized network data;data publishers;network data anonymization;network privacy;security research","","10","","46","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","2373-0854;23730854","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many Intrusion Detection Systems have been proposed to detect these intrusions. However, as the Internet grows day by day, there is a huge amount of data (big data) that needs to be processed to detect intruders. For this reason, intrusion detection has to be done in real-time before intruders can inflict damage, and previous detection systems do not satisfy this need for big data. Using Apache Storm, a Real time Hybrid Intrusion Detection System has been developed in our work. Apache Storm serves as a distributed, fault tolerant, real time big data stream processor. The hybrid detection system consists of two neural networks. The CC4 instantaneous neural network acts as an anomaly-based detection for unknown attacks and the Multi Layer Perceptron neural network acts as a misuse-based detection for known attacks. Based on the outputs from these two neural networks, the incoming data will be classified as attack or normal. We found the average accuracy of hybrid detection system is 89% with a 4.32% false positive rate. This model is appropriate for real time detection since Apache Storm acts as a real time streaming processor, which can also handle big data.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336370","Apache Storm;CC4 neural network;Hybrid intrusion detection;ISCX 2012 Intrusion dataset;multi-layered perceptron;real time streaming","Fasteners;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Real-time systems;Storms;Training","Big Data;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;multilayer perceptrons;real-time systems;security of data","Apache Storm;CC4 instantaneous neural network;anomaly-based detection;attack data;data classification;distributed-fault tolerant-real time Big Data stream processor;false positive rate;misuse-based detection;multilayer perceptron neural network;normal data;real-time hybrid intrusion detection system;unknown attacks","","","","10","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS). We also discuss on how the similar friendship concept could be used to address several challenges faced in MANET environment.","","978-0-7695-3324-7;9780769533247","","10.1109/IAS.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627093","Friend Mechanisms;MANET;Small World","Ad hoc networks;Centralized control;Communication system control;Data communication;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Waste materials","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MANET;QoS;autoconfiguration methods;autonomous environment;battery power;data transmission process;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;resource degradation;resource management","","4","","15","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The splits are not based on any distance or similarity measure. By introducing the idea of PDDP method to intrusion detection, the number of clusters is able to be determined automatically. PDDPC have two advantages, one is that the singular value decomposition (SVD) can be stopped at the first singular value/vector and this makes PDDPC significantly more computational advantages, the other is that no distance and similarity measure is needed to define. The results of the experiments with KDD CUP1999 data show that this scheme can improve the detection quality effectively.

That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors.

Because Skype uses both encryption and overlays, detection and blocking of Skype is non- trivial. Motivated by the work ofBiondi and Desclaux [3], we adopt the view of Skype as a backdoor and we take a forensic approach to analyze it. We share our experience in this paper. With the forensic evidence, we identify a transport layer communication framework for Skype. We further formulate a set of socket-based detection and control policies for Skype traffics. Our detection method is a hybrid between payload and non-payload inspections, with improved accuracy and version sustainability over the traditional payload-only approaches.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features.

The modified measurements with the new added ones form a set of measurements that will be used throughout the testing process. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for testing IDS in MANET. Simulators are the most common tools used for testing the IDS.

However, ATMs incur a significant significant cost overhead in the form of capital and operational costs. The problem of ATM location is further complicated as customers of one bank can use their debit cards at any other bank's ATMs. While this might attract charges, some banks often refund these charges to attract customers. Banks need to have a mechanism to quantitatively measure the benefits of managing their own ATM versus paying for services rendered to it's customers by other banks through their ATMs. Game theory is the study of strategic decision making and is an effective technique to identify the best business strategy when provided with multiple options. In this paper we propose a game theoretic model based on stochastic games to identify the best strategy to be adopted by banks for their ATM expansion. We further propose an algorithm to identify the idle locations where a bank should place an ATM should the result of the ATM game recommend that the bank should establish it's own ATM.","","978-1-4673-8492-6;9781467384926","","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395687","ATM Placement;GIS;Game Theory;Stochastic Games","Game theory;Games;Online banking;Stochastic processes;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","automatic teller machines;bank data processing;decision making;stochastic games","ATM expansion;ATM game;ATM location;ATM services;banking services;business strategy;cash deposit;cash withdrawal;stochastic game theoretic model;strategic decision making","","","","23","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Data Processing on FPGAs","J. Teubner; L. Woods","","Data Processing on FPGAs","20140702","2013","","","","","Roughly a decade ago, power consumption and heat dissipation concerns forced the semiconductor industry to radically change its course, shifting from sequential to parallel computing. Unfortunately, improving performance of applications has now become much more difficult than in the good old days of frequency scaling. This is also affecting databases and data processing applications in general, and has led to the popularity of so-called data appliancesspecialized data processing engines, where software and hardware are sold together in a closed box. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) increasingly play an important role in such systems. FPGAs are attractive because the performance gains of specialized hardware can be significant, while power consumption is much less than that of commodity processors. On the other hand, FPGAs are way more flexible than hard-wired circuits (ASICs) and can be integrated into complex systems in many different ways, e.g., directly in the network for a high-frequency trading application. This book gives an introduction to FPGA technology targeted at a database audience. In the first few chapters, we explain in detail the inner workings of FPGAs. Then we discuss techniques and design patterns that help mapping algorithms to FPGA hardware so that the inherent parallelism of these devices can be leveraged in an optimal way. Finally, the book will illustrate a number of concrete examples that exploit different advantages of FPGAs for data processing.

However, modern security systems that are applied in today's highly dynamic ICT networks, including malware scanners and intrusion detection systems, apply a kind of black-list approach, where they consider only actions and behavior that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces. We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior. We demonstrate the application of the system in a small-scale pilot case of a real utility provider.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816388","anomaly detection;event correlation;ict security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Malware;Privacy;SCADA systems;Smart grids","invasive software;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","Internet;access points;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection technique;attack patterns;black-list approach;electricity grid;intrusion detection systems;malware scanners;malware trace signatures;security level;security systems;smart grid ICT networks;smart white-list approach;system event tracking;utility provider","","2","","10","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets.

In this paper, we designed and implemented a host-based intrusion detection system, which combines two detection technologies, one is log file analysis technology and the other is BP neural network technology. Log file analysis is an approach of misuse detection, and BP neural network is an approach of anomaly detection.

Another is the lack of commercial tools to assist in the technique for software. Most SFTA research efforts have been directed at requirements or code. Performing SFTA on the design may enable application of SFTA to critical code only, thus reducing the amount of effort.

Experiment has been done on dataset in KDD-99 and the result shows that it is an effective method.","","0-7803-8406-7;0780384067","","10.1109/ICOSP.2004.1441631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1441631","","Application software;Computer bugs;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web sites","Internet;pattern classification;protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","malicious action;multiple classifiers;network intrusion detection system;pattern recognition;protocol analysis","","0","1","7","","","31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Collective intrusion detection in wide area networks","A. Nafir; S. Mazouzi; S.

We use the multi-agent paradigm to model the proposed distributed system. In this system, an agent, which plays several roles, is situated on each node of the net. The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence. Experiments on our system show its potential for satisfactory DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4799-3019-7;9781479930197","","10.1109/INISTA.2014.6873596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873596","DDoS;IDS;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Network security","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Wide area networks","Internet;computer network security;multi-agent systems;wide area networks","IDS;Internet;agent neighbouring;collective intrusion detection;data sharing;distributed denial of service;distributed system;local neighbour nodes;multiagent paradigm;satisfactory DDoS attack detection;security data;security event;wide area networks","","0","","15","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Personalized Approach Based on SVM and ANN for Detecting Credit Card Fraud","Rong-Chang Chen; Shu-Ting Luo; Xun Liang; V. C. S.

This new approach proposes to prevent fraud before initial use of a new card, even users without any real transaction data. This approach shows potential, nevertheless, there are some problems needed solving. A main issue is how to predict accurately with only few data, since it collects quasi-real transaction data via an online questionnaire system and thus respondents are commonly unwilling to spend too much time to reply questionnaires. This study employs both support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to investigate the time-varying fraud problem. The performance of ANN is compared with that from SVM. Results show that SVM and ANN are comparable in training but ANN can have highest training accuracy. However, ANN seems to overfit training data and thus has worse performance of predicting the future data when data number is small","","0-7803-9422-4;0780394224","","10.1109/ICNNB.2005.1614747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614747","","Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Consumer behavior;Credit cards;Engineering management;Logistics;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Technology management;Training data","credit transactions;fraud;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","artificial neural networks;credit card fraud prevention;online questionnaire system;personalized approach;quasi-real transaction data;support vector machines;time-varying fraud problem","","5","","27","","","13-15 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It describes the most important characteristics of network traffic, which are usually measured during their monitoring, as well as different approaches for the evaluation of network traffic properties. Current research and development in the field of network monitoring is focused on the abilities to measure various network traffic characteristics. The greatest effort is placed on the maximization of their efficiency and minimization of their impacts on the overall functionality of the network. Since there are many approaches for measuring network traffic properties, only the most commonly used ones will be discussed, i.e. active and passive measurement. The paper is concluded with some notes aimed at the future direction by which should research work proceed.","1543-9259;15439259","978-1-4799-0828-8;9781479908288","","10.1109/INES.2013.6632836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632836","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Delays;Loss measurement;Monitoring;Optimization;Routing","computer networks;monitoring;research and development;telecommunication traffic","network traffic monitoring;passive approach;research and development","","2","","24","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
