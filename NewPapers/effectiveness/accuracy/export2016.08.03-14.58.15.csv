Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","1","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a method that explores transmission vulnerabilities of the encrypted traffic allowing its detection. Hence, an experimental test bed was created to capture a diversity of traffic, which includes flows of a widely used P2P media streaming application called Goal Bit.

These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where only pure frequent episode rule is used.","","978-1-4244-3427-5;9781424434275","978-1-4244-3426-8;9781424434268","10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770028","Anomaly detection;Frequent episode rule;Internet security;Traffic data mining;weighted fuzzy matching","Association rules;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Face detection;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Web and internet services","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet anomaly detection;Internet security;data mining;frequent episode rules;machine learning;network intrusion;weighted fuzzy matching algorithm","","0","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive and vital data have a key character in organizing and storing within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. The existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the Data-Base (DB-IDS) is a necessity because enterprises awash in data often struggle to answer basic question about detecting or preventing all facet of their threat. In this paper, we propose a novel type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level) in a high-rate transaction processing. For simplicity, our model is divided into two parts; detection method at transaction level and inter-transaction level (detection with learning method, concurrently in both level). Detection method at transaction level is based on describing the expected (normal) transactions within the database applications. This is also focused on anomaly detection and used data mining to find dependency and sequence rules (the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity) in where inter-transaction level is used. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the widely used intrusion detection techniques. However, the commonly used two-class SVM algorithms are facing difficulties of constructing the training dataset. That is because in many real application scenarios, normal connection records are easy to be obtained, but attack records are not so. We propose an anomaly detection model based on One-class SVM to detect network intrusions. The one-class SVM adopts only normal network connection records as the training dataset. But after being trained, it is able to recognize normal from various attacks. This just meets the requirements of the anomaly detection. Experimental results on KDDCUP99 dataset show that compared to Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and C-SVM, our anomaly detection model based on One-class SVM achieves higher detection rates and yields average better performance in terms of precision, recall and F-value.","","","","10.1109/MSN.2015.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420931","anomaly detection;intrusion detection;one-class SVM;scaling strategy","Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Training","computer network security;support vector machines","KDDCUP99 dataset;anomaly detection model;network intrusion detection;network security problem;support vector machine;training dataset;two-class SVM algorithm","","","","31","","","16-18 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, they need a tool to determine if a host is using a network connection for something other than the intended use. A key step in developing this tool is creating statistical models to accurately identify the application protocols of sessions in a network without relying on port numbers, which conventionally identify them. This paper outlines the construction of these models. Specifically, it focuses on the methods used to build them, which included: structuring network data in a database, aggregating packet level data into sessions, and then identifying the key variables. The models employ variables such as the inter-arrival time between packets, the variance of those times, the distribution of TCP control flags and other information available from the packet headers. The paper examines the significance of these explanatory variables and attempts to determine which would be useful in a real-time implementation.","","978-1-4244-2365-1;9781424423651","978-1-4244-2366-8;9781424423668","10.1109/SIEDS.2008.4559677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559677","","Computer networks;Computer security;Design engineering;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Network servers;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;USA Councils","IP networks;Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet security;TCP control flag;TCP session classification;government computer network;network database;network traffic monitoring tool;network traffic pattern anomaly detection;packet level data aggregation;statistical approach","","1","","5","","","25-25 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose Bloom-1, a new data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a classical Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this new family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller and comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But in a multilayer information architecture, the database operation trails are cut off by middle layer service systems, which makes the operation source can be identified only by embedded audit modules. Since it is too expensive for many application systems to rebuild and embed such modules, the paper proposes an economical solution which can identify the database operation source close to the fact. The advantage of the algorithm is its support to bypass monitoring mode, which needs no change to existed application systems and is more economical than embedded audit modules.

The fundamental building blocks of this system is the concept of building chronological ordered sequence of events which represent the details of the attacks (ARP). Then by applying the three weighting models we are able to provide more realistic views of attacks. This concept of weighting, where different events are assigned different weights, serves as the basis of the alert regression profile allowing the use of thresholds. Thresholds represent the fine balance between the accuracy of the alert and its timeliness.

The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification.

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366;23255366","978-1-4799-0450-1;9781479904501","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","7","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also show how bad neighborhoods are highly concentrated at a few Internet Service Providers and discuss how our findings can be employed to improve current network and spam filters and incentivize botnet mitigation initiatives.","0163-6804;01636804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852094","","Business;Computer security;Databases;IP networks;Internet;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;information filters;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","Internet bad neighborhoods;attack prediction;botnet mitigation initiatives;malicious IP addresses;malicious activities;phishing;spam filters","","1","","16","","","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community.

The combination of feature selection using the newly proposed genetic feature selection algorithm with Support Vector Machine based classification gives better results than other exiting methods.

Based on the investigation of correlativity changes of monitored network features during flooding attacks, this paper employs statistical covariance matrices to build a norm profile of normal activities in information systems and directly utilizes the changes of covariance matrices to detect various flooding attacks. The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks. The evaluation results show that the detection approach can accurately differentiate the flooding attacks from the normal traffic.

Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the pervasiveness of internet, network security has become critical issue in every organization. Network attacks results in massive amount of loss in terms of money, reputation and data confidentiality. Reducing or eliminating the negative effects of any intrusion is a fundamental issue of network security. The network security problem can be represented as a game between the attacker or intruder and the network administrator where both the players try to attain maximum outcome. The network administrator tries to defend the attack and the attacker tries to overcome it and attack the system. Thus network security can be enforced using game theoretic approach.

The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naive Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7;9781467313667","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Song","","20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF'07)","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2819-8;0769528198","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","10","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls.

Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.","","","","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380646","Overload Control;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);kamailio;server","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Floods;Internet telephony;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;quality of service;resource allocation;signalling protocols","DDoS attack detection;DDoS attack mitigation;Hellinger distance;QoS;SIP load balancer;SIP-based voice over IP network;VOIP network security;distributed denial of service attack;open source kamailio SIP proxy server;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is a challenge because intrusion detection systems built for conventional computer systems tend to be unsuitable. They can be too demanding for resource-restricted cyber-physical systems or too inaccurate due to the lack of real-world data on actual attack behaviours. Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368559","Command injection;Cyber-physical attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decision tree;Denial of service (DoS);Intrusion detection;Mobile robots;Network security","Computer crime;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Robot kinematics;Vehicles","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;decision trees;mobile robots;security of data;telerobotics;vehicles","attack behaviours;automobiles;command injection attacks;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision tree-based detection;denial of service attacks;detection rules;disk data;drones;false positive rate;intrusion detection systems;mobile cyber-physical systems;network traffic;physical input features;physical jittering;power consumption;security;small remote-controlled robotic vehicle","","","","28","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on","20090825","2009","","","285","289","Over the past few years, anomaly detection has been an increasing concern with the rapid growth of the network security. Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming.

This information supports various intelligent behaviors of a service robot in day-to-day scenarios. This paper presents a novel probability-based approach to building a location aware system. With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system. In the experiments, three alarm sensors were employed to monitor abnormal conditions. If an intrusion was detected, the robot immediately moves to the location and transmits scene images to the user, allowing the user to respond to the situation in real time.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2277691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587583","Autonomous navigation;location aware system;received signal strength indicator;security robot;sensor network","Mobile nodes;Robot sensing systems;Security;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Zigbee;calibration;intelligent robots;mobile robots;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;safety systems;service robots","RSSI measurements;ZigBee sensor network;calibration;intelligent behaviors;location aware module;mobile robot;on-demand robotic intrusion detection system;probability-based location aware design;received signal strength indicator;service robot","","1","","26","","2013-08-28","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To exclusively discriminate illegitimate nodes, we propose a method of using multiple and multiple-angle measurements of a Wi-Fi network nodepsilas signal strength. In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate.

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","978-1-4799-2548-3;9781479925483","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","0","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters.

In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem.

So optimization methods using dynamic traffic characteristics are exploited. Our contributions lie in three folds. Firstly, a novel best classification tree is formally defined aiming to minimize the visit cost of the traffic in the slot, based on which optimization methods are exploited.
