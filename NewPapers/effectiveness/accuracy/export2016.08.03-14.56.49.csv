Therefore, designing a model to strengthen up the intrusion detection system based on the uncertain and unpredictable malicious behaviour of the adversary is computationally challenging problem. This paper presents a technique called as ZIDS i.e. Zonal-based Intrusion Detection System that uses potential of game theory in order to extracts the uncertain strategies of the malicious node.

Many research works were conducted to improve IDS's accuracy by reducing the rate of false alerts and eliminating outliers. In this paper, we propose a three-stage process to detect false alerts and outliers. In the first stage, we cluster the set of elementary alerts to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove outliers from the set of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the last stage, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify meta-alerts either as false alerts or real attacks.

Why can people not effectively detect social engineering, or more specifically, the art of deception? What can be done to augment human abilities for the task? The current findings warrant several possibilities that influence human ability to detect deception. Factors include such things as truth-bias, stereotypical thinking and processing ability. Knowing that human detection ability is limited, we propose a method to automatically detect deception that potentially assists humans.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined.

The change it advises of logically centralizing the overall network control on software platforms and applications, turns networks more and more into software-based systems. Such paradigm shift enables to build more manageable, agile and smarter data communication infrastructures. Despite the interest it is deserving on a multitude of physical and virtualized infrastructures, currently there are no systematic approaches of characterizing and comparing alternative SDN-based solutions regarding their resilience -- a characteristic of utmost importance on such critical environments. In this paper we present a tentative path to bridge this gap, by proposing a research agenda to advance resilience benchmarks for SDNs. We believe that with such class of tools and methodologies, researchers, developers and practitioners will become in a better position to advance the area and take more informed decisions.","","","","10.1109/ISSREW.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983833","Resilience Assessment;Resilience Benchmarking;Software Defined Networking","Benchmark testing;Context;Control systems;Measurement;Protocols;Resilience;Software defined networking","software defined networking;software reliability;virtualisation","SDN;data communication infrastructures;network control centralization;resilience benchmarking;software defined networking","","0","","28","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers have proposed the IDS with different techniques to achieve the best accuracy with the consolidation of Clustering and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Clustering and ANN based models give better precision rate with better accuracy where attack records are low. Nevertheless, all the features of dataset are not relevant for classifying different attacks. So, feature selection can improve the stability and accuracy of IDS. In this paper, it is proposed that IDS with the amalgamation of best efficient features selected by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the computational complexity of the system. It has been combined with the K-means clustering technique to cluster the specific groups of attacks and Artificial Neural Network to get a preeminent output by training the formulation of different base models. The model name has been defined by FP-ANK model. Investigational results have been reported on the NSL-KDD dataset where the accuracy rate associating with other models is distinct to validate the proposed system.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2015.7488089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488089","Artificial Neural Network;Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;NSL-KDD;Principal Component Analysis","Artificial neural networks;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","feature selection;neural nets;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;security of data","ANN;FP-ANK model;IDS;PCA;artificial neural network;feature selection;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;principal component analysis","","","","24","","","21-23 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Sui Song; C. N. Manikopoulos","","2006 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","1","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system.

However, effective configuration (training and tuning) is critical for deployment of such schemes in practice. As network traffic may shift over time, the ability to perform fast reconfiguration is needed to provide the level of security necessary for future applications.

We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others.

However, due to the lack of a physical line of defense, the security in such a network is a big concern. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered as one of the most effective security mechanisms in WMN. Traditionally, IDS is operated on the monitor nodes that cooperatively identify and assess intrusions by analyzing their collected network data. Therefore, most IDS mechanisms need to choose a large number of monitor nodes for good rapidity and accuracy, which increases overhead and degrades network performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic cooperative monitor node selection scheme based on social network analysis to solve the above issue. In the scheme, we choose the monitor nodes according to their influence in the network, which is evaluated by the relationship among the nodes and the analysis of mutual information. Then, the nodes with similar information are divided into the same monitor area. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce network cost compared with the traditional node section schemes.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336433","Monitor node selection;cooperative;mutual information;social network analysis","Accuracy;Bridges;Monitoring;Mutual information;Security;Social network services;Topology","security of data;social networking (online);wireless mesh networks","IDS mechanisms;WMN;dynamic cooperative monitor node selection algorithm;intrusion detection system;social network analysis;wireless broadband connectivity;wireless mesh networks","","","","16","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3;9781424469383","978-1-4244-6939-0;9781424469390","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly.

It analyzes the alerts from one or more intrusion detection system and provides a compact summarized report and high-level view of attempted intrusions which highly improves security effectiveness. Correlation component is a procedure which aggregates alerts according to certain criteria. The aggregated alerts could have common features or represent steps of pre-defined scenario attacks. Correlation approaches composed of a single component or a comprehensive set of components. The effectiveness of a component depends heavily on the nature of the dataset analyzed. The order of correlation component will affect the correlation process performance. Moreover not all components should be used for different dataset. This paper presents an agent-based alert correlation model.

First, the database of the normal patterns would be missing. Second, some new patterns would be missed in the detection process.

The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon. We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes.

Due to lack of information, it can be quite difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems to identify such attacks in progress. Cooperative intrusion detection, on the basis of information sharing, is proved as a necessary measure to detect widespread attacks by other researcher D. Frincke (2000), Polla, D. et al., (1998). This paper presents a cooperative approach for intrusion detection that provides a method for individual ID components working cooperatively to perform concerted detections. Being constructed on the basis of ID components, CoIDS can adopt both existed (usually more mature) and new ID techniques. This makes CoIDS extensible and scalable. In addition, an ID component is essentially an autonomous agent, which makes CoIDS available with certain loss of functionality even when the intrusion detection manager does not work. Its reliability is also improved because failure of one ID component will not cause any other to stop working. Furthermore, it improved the accuracy of detection for conventional intrusions by validating analysis result with data from different ID components.","0840-7789;08407789","0-7803-7781-8;0780377818","","10.1109/CCECE.2003.1226031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226031","","Autonomous agents;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Data analysis;Decision making;Internetworking;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Prototypes;Wide area networks","Internet;cooperative systems;internetworking;safety systems","Internet;autonomous agent;computer system;concerted detection;cooperative intrusion detection system;individual ID component;information sharing;internetworking;multiple host;multiple network;widespread attack detection","","1","2","13","","","4-7 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information. Computationally, SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected, directed and weighted traffic graphs up to a million nodes.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","30","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an innovative approach that coordinates distributed network traffic Monitors and attack Correlators supported by Open Virtual Switches (OVS). The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources.

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High dimensional dataset degrades the performance of learning algorithm as learning algorithm try to analyze and accommodate all the features. Feature selection technique is used as a pre-processing step to analyze and compress large data set. The main objective of feature selection technique is to identify relevant features and removes redundant features from high dimensional dataset. The main goal of feature selection technique is to reduce dimensions of dataset, improve classification accuracy, reduce computational cost, and better visualization of data. By considering only useful features, the performance of classification algorithm can be improved. To select reduced set of relevant features from set of all features, various search techniques such as complete search, random search and sequential search etc. are used. Each generated subset of features is validated using various evaluation techniques such as filter, wrapper, and hybrid approach. The main aim of any search technique is to generate optimal subset of features. A general methodology of feature selection process is summarized in this paper on the basis of search and evaluation techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent developments in feature selection techniques.

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.","","978-0-7695-2874-8;9780769528748","","10.1109/FSKD.2007.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun","data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation","data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries","","1","","18","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved require/provide model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map. The map can be used to discretely analyze the correlated attack activities which in other case may go undetected thus facilitating the multi-stage attack recognition process.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-61284-313-1;9781612843131","978-0-7695-4337-6;9780769543376","10.1109/AINA.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763386","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;SQL Injection;multi-stage attac","Correlation;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Mars;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Security","SQL;security of data;statistical analysis","SQL injection attack;SQLI activities;attack signatures;cyber crime;event based alert correlation system;knowledge based model;rule based mechanisms;statistical modeling","","0","","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes.

Host and network security are getting more critical and more complex due to the diversified and evolved ways of attack form anyplace in Internet world. Most of the technologies been developed are focusing on protecting individual systems and limited scope of network by using different diagnosis and detection approaches. Both commercial and noncommercial solutions, called IDS (intrusion detection system), usually maintain their own proprietary databases by collecting detection patterns. In general, more patterns collected and more up-to-date of the databases surely increase the capabilities of their bundled IDS solutions. However, due to the coverage limitation and late awareness, there still have new growing uncovered breaches that single IDS would not be able to catch up. The reasons are two: 1) Any one proprietary IDS is incapable of collecting so many detection patterns daily brought up in Internet world. 2) Systems under certain proprietary IDS's protection are unable to get instant notification of new detection patterns, most of which are discovered by other IDSs. In order to reduce the risks of coverage limitation and time delay of new types of attack, a joint defense service framework is been proposed, which work as human nervous system to protect every nodes within the system at all.","","0-7803-7882-2;0780378822","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297610","","Databases;Delay effects;Explosives;Humans;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Nervous system;Neurons;Protection","Internet;authorisation;database management systems;neural nets;safety systems","Internet connectivity;e-service;joint defense service framework;network intrusion detection system;neuron security;proprietary databases","","0","","5","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
