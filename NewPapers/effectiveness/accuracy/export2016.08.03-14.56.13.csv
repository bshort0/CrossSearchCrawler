Twenty-Third Annual","20080102","2007","","","97","106","Various attacks (e.g., SQL injections) may corrupt data items in the database systems, which decreases the integrity level of the database. Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a unsafe zone to isolate user's SQL queries from a safe zone of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases. Our techniques can be applied to database systems to provide multizone isolations with different levels of QoS.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412980","","Application software;Computer science;Computer security;Database systems;Delay;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","SQL;data integrity;quality of service;query processing;security of data;transaction processing","SQL injections;SQL queries;data corruption attacks;database filtering;database isolation;database system transactions;integrity level;intrusion detections systems;quality of service;recovery cost reduction;sequential analysis;uniform processing latency;unsafe zone","","1","","18","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper first presents an Internet worm monitoring system. Then, based on the idea of detecting the trend, not the burst of monitored illegitimate traffic, we present a trend detection methodology to detect a worm at its early propagation stage by using Kalman filter estimation, which is robust to background noise in the monitored data. In addition, for uniform-scan worms such as Code Red, we can effectively predict the overall vulnerable population size, and estimate accurately how many computers are really infected in the global Internet based on the biased monitored data. For monitoring a nonuniform scan worm, especially a sequential-scan worm such as Blaster, we show that it is crucial for the address space covered by the worm monitoring system to be as distributed as possible.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2005.857113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528487","Computer network security;Internet worm;early detection;network monitoring","Computer hacking;Computer science;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Societies;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;Kalman filters;authorisation;computer viruses;information filters;monitoring;telecommunication traffic","Internet worm monitoring;Kalman filter estimation;background noise;computer network security;counteraction;early detection system;early warning information;illegitimate traffic monitoring;security threat;self-propagating worm;sequential-scan worm;trend detection methodology;uniform-scan worm","","95","3","50","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results presented here are specific to residential DR but the approach is general and it could be applied to other systems within the Smart Grid and to other critical infrastructure domains. Our architecture-based analysis is different from most other approaches to analyzing complex systems in that it addresses multiple quality attributes simultaneously (e.g., performance, reliability, security, modifiability, usability, etc.) and it considers the architecture of a complex system from a socio-technical perspective where the actions of the people in the system are as important, from an analysis perspective, as the physical and computational elements of the system. This analysis can be done early in a system's lifetime, before substantial resources have been committed to its construction or procurement, and so it provides extremely cost-effective risk analysis.","0270-5257;02705257","978-1-4503-0445-0;9781450304450","978-1-4503-0445-0;9781450304450","10.1145/1985793.1985886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032507","architecture analysis;smart grid;socio-technical systems;ultra-large-scale systems","Computer architecture;Electricity;Load management;Pricing;Reliability;Security;Smart grids","demand side management;large-scale systems;risk analysis;smart power grids;software architecture","United States residential demand response system;architecture evaluation;complex system;cost-effective risk analysis;quality attributes;residential DR system;risk discovery;smart grid;socio-technical concern","","4","","14","","","21-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370;12292370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

GNP is a graph-based evolutionary algorithm and can extract many important class association rules by making use of the distinguished representation ability of the graph structures. In this paper, a probabilistic classification is proposed and combined with the class association rule mining of GNP, and applied to Network intrusion detection for the performance evaluation. The proposed method creates a joint probability density function of normal and intrusion accesses and use it to efficiently classify new access data into normal, known intrusion or unknown intrusion.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8;9781424410248","978-1-4244-1025-5;9781424410255","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","2161-4393;21614393","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","29","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8;9781457717048","978-1-4577-1702-4;9781457717024","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","15","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas. Such an application might be useful in regulating cross-boundary passage of illegal immigrants to Malaysia. Wireless sensor remote monitoring may offer advantages over current remote monitoring systems in Malaysia, which utilize satellite transmission primarily.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;game theory-based energy-theft detection;security vulnerabilities;smart grid proliferation;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;utility companies","","9","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The framework includes author behavior categories, which are the set of characteristics that remain relatively constant for a large number of messages written by the author. Specific topics include user pattern analysis, user profiling, categorization, computational linguistics, data mining, and anomaly detection. The experiments focus on applying character frequency analysis to IM messages for authorship identification and validation. This addresses the questions; can we identify an author of an IM conversation based strictly on user behavior, do different conversations with a single user look similar, do conversations with different users look different, and what is the demarcation between similar and different? Another experiment focuses on applying an instance-based learning algorithm to the character frequency of IM user messages for authorship identification and validation.

Unfortunately, deriving the signatures manually is very time consuming and difficult. Machine learning has been widely used in network data analysis. But existing studies mostly considered statistical network flow attributes such as packet size distributions, for that there arenpsilat so far efficient solutions to extract signatures based on application-level content.

Transmission and distribution substations contain cyber critical assets including remote terminal units (RTU), intelligent electronic devices (IED) such as relays, phasor measurement units (PMU) and phasor data concentrators (PDC). Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic. Network traffic is forwarded to the existing network. Additionally, the data logger architecture supports use of signature based and statistics based intrusion detection algorithms at the network appliance edge.","","978-1-4244-8947-3;9781424489473","","10.1109/PECON.2010.5697717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5697717","Data Logging;Intrusion Detection;Process Control System Cyber Security;SCADA Cyber Security","","SCADA systems;data loggers;security of data;substations","SCADA;distribution substation;intrusion detection system;network traffic;phasor measurement unit;remote terminal unit;retrofit network transaction data logger;serial communication;substation","","5","","9","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","10.1145/1185347.1185372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Engines;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Software","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","1","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which detection data is acquired at the leaves and is incrementally aggregated, reduced, and analyzed as it flows upward toward the root. Security management directives flow downward from nodes at the top. To maintain communications efficiency, the hierarchy is automatically reconfigured as needed using clustering techniques in which clusterheads are selected based on topology and other criteria.

In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions.

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture.

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks. Our method uses Random Forests to build classifiers based on which the incoming slow-read traffic can be detected at the destination.

In order to ensure high security this work focuses on multiple classifier fusion technique to increase detection rate. The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done. Decision based on threshold value and combining the classifiers result based on majority voting rule helps to increase the overall efficiency and accuracy in detecting the various categories of attack.","","978-1-4799-3826-1;9781479938261","","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915405","Fusion;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Majority Voting Rule;Multiple Classifier","","security of data;sensor fusion","detection methodologies;diversified intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;misuse based attacks;multiple classifier fusion technique;security;sensor fusion;threshold value","","0","","17","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the popular social engineering attacks is a phishing attack, exploiting humans' vulnerability in order to obtain individuals' private or credential information. Recent studies have found that the so called `phishing susceptibility' (i.e., the likelihood of being phished) is closely correlated with the individuals' personality traits. In particular, the relations between phishing susceptibility and Big Five personality traits have been analyzed via empirical studies in diverse domains. However, little prior work has proposed a mathematical model investigating the effect of an individual's personality traits on perceived trust or risk and decision performance. This work proposes a probability model using Stochastic Petri Nets in order to examine the effect of an individual human's personality traits on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance. Our results show that agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effect on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance particularly when openness and conscientiousness is very low. The developed mathematical model can be applied to predict what personality profiles in an organization are more exposed to social engineering, suggesting customized security training scenarios.","","","","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497779","perceived risk;perceived trust;personality traits;phishing susceptibility","Analytical models;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Petri nets;Resilience;Security;Uncertainty","Petri nets;computer crime;trusted computing","Big Five personality traits;customized security training scenarios;cyberspace;decision performance;human personality traits;mathematical model;modeling;neuroticism;perceived trust;phishing attack;phishing susceptibility;phishing vulnerability;probability model;social engineering attacks;stochastic Petri nets","","","","21","","","21-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under the framework of Internet worm tomography, we attempt to infer Internet worm temporal behaviors, i.e., the host infection time and the worm infection sequence, and thus pinpoint patient zero or initially infected hosts. Specifically, we apply statistical estimation techniques and propose method of moments, maximum likelihood, and linear regression estimators. We show analytically and empirically that our proposed estimators can better infer worm temporal characteristics than a naive estimator that has been used in the previous work.

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2;9789639799592","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","1","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","4","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even if a lot of research was already done on this topic, the perfect IDS has still not been found and it stays a hot and challenging area in computer security research. This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources.

As such, paper-based invoices may still be issued along with e-invoices, contradicting an important benefit of e-invoicing - paper consumption reduction. Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on. Still, an extra security mechanism is needed to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the content, as invoices may bear some value and thus become the target of a security attack. In this paper, we propose a secure NFC-based e-invoice remitting scheme using standard NFC P2P communications, and discuss how it fulfills major security requirements, including authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.

To render networks more secure, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim to recognize attacks within constraints of two major performance considerations: high detection and low false-alarm rates. It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems. IDSs are firmly entrenched on the security front but the exact role they can play and what their deployment entails must be clear to planners of security. Nine artificial neural networks (ANN) based IDS were implemented and tested with three experiments with three topologies. The results showed that: (i) in average the modular neural network (MNN) provided the best results in experiment #3; about 99.60%; (ii) in average multilayer perceptron (MLP) provided the best results in experiment #2; 74.71%; (iii) in experiment #1; the MNN provided the best results.","","978-1-4244-5106-7;9781424451067","","10.1109/ELECO.2009.5355338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355338","","Art;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-layer neural network;Network topology;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Testing","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Internet;artificial neural network;intrusion detection systems;modular neural network;multilayer perceptron","","1","","16","","","5-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since current approaches to detecting network intrusions rely on associating individual network actions the temporal distribution of an attack throughout a network makes it extremely difficult to accurately identify the intrusion. This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure.

The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network. By this resource allocation approach, the selfish attacks can be prevented in the system and thereby increase the resource utilization efficiency in the network","","978-1-78561-030-1;9781785610301","","10.1049/ic.2013.0363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119750","CRAHN;Shapley value;coalitional game theory;cognitive radio;core;selfish attacks","","ad hoc networks;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;signal detection;telecommunication security","CR;Shapley value;advanced wireless communication device;coalition game theory based resource allocation strategy;cognitive radio ad-hoc networks;cooperative communication devices;intelligent radio;multiple PU;multiple SU;resource utilization efficiency;self-centered cognitive radio;selfish attack avoidance;selfish cognitive radio node;spectrum holes;spectrum sensing","","0","","","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution.

The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection.

An SMM is expected to produce correct outcomes while scanning the input data at high rates. Furthermore the string sets that are searched for are usually large and their sizes increase steadily. Bloom Filters (BFs) are hashing data structures which are fast but their false positive results require further processing. That is, their speed can be exploited for Standard Bloom Filter SMMs (SBFs) as long as the positive probability is low. Multiple BFs in parallel can further increase the throughput. In this paper, we propose the Double Bloom Filter SMM (DBF) which achieves a higher throughput than the SBF and maintains a high throughput even for large positive probabilities. The second Bloom Filter of DBF stores a small enough subset of the positive strings such that its false positive probability is approximately zero. We develop an analytical model of the DBF and show that the throughput advantage of DBF over SBF becomes more prominent if the positive probability and the fraction of matches in the second Bloom Filter increase. Accordingly, we propose a heuristic algorithm that stores the strings that are more frequently matched in the second Bloom Filter according to localities identified in the input. Our numerical results are obtained using realistic values from an FPGA implementation and are validated by SystemC simulations.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2577033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485864","Bloom filter;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate array (FPGA);string matching","Analytical models;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Matched filters;Metadata;Throughput;Time factors","","","","","","","","2016-06-06","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform.

Raytheon is developing a system architecture and design for a perimeter security system that specifically addresses this issue for large facilities such as airports, seaports and rail facilities. The architecture uses the DoD's Architecture Framework guidelines. It employs a multi-sensor approach, including ground surveillance radars and cameras, to detect, assess and track perimeter incursions. It is designed to operate 24/7 in all weather conditions. A command and control center provides timely and accurate situational awareness to facility security personnel responsible for monitoring and managing incidents. Mobile communications also provide situational awareness to first responders in the field. The architecture supports integration with existing security systems, such as access control and closed circuit television, to centralize security monitoring for the entire facility. This architecture is the basis for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Perimeter Intrusion Detection System for four airports, including John F. Kennedy International. Raytheon's system engineering process as applied to the perimeter security application is described, with focus on the key early process phases of threat analysis, operational concept generation, system requirements analysis, and system architecture and design development. Key technical parameters, including probability of detection and nuisance alarm rate, that drive the system design and cost are also discussed.

We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository.

However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely attack signature, resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature.

But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy.

This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0;9781424450190","978-1-4244-5020-6;9781424450206","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","4","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

However, flow monitoring is, by design, susceptible to anomalies that generate a large number of flows, such as Distributed Denial-Of-Service attacks. This paper aims at getting a better understanding on how a flow monitoring application reacts to the presence of massive attacks. We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments. We conclude that the observed changes in the flow data might cause unwanted effects in monitoring applications. Furthermore, our results show that our model can help to parametrize and dimension flow-based monitoring systems.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211908","","Analytical models;Computer crime;Educational institutions;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Probes","IP networks;computer network management;computer network security","DDoS attack effect;IP network monitoring;dimension flow-based monitoring systems;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow data;network management","","6","","22","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most current intrusion detection systems focus on hybrid supervised and unsupervised machine learning technologies. The related work has demonstrated that they can get superior performance than applying single machine learning algorithm in detection model. Besides, with the scrutiny of related works, feature selecting and representing techniques are also essential in pursuit of high efficiency and effectiveness. Performance of specified attack type detection should also be improved and evaluated. In this paper, we incorporate information gain (IG) method for selecting more discriminative features and triangle area based support vector machine (TASVM) by combining k-means clustering algorithm and SVM classifier to detect attacks. Our system achieves accuracy of 99.83%, detection rate of 99.88% and false alarm rate of 2.99% on the 10% of KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set. We also achieve a better detection performance for specific attack types concerning precision and recall.","","978-0-7695-3940-9;9780769539409","978-1-4244-5667-3;9781424456673","10.1109/ICFN.2010.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431864","KDD CUP 1999;intrusion detection system;k-means;machine learning;support vector machine;triangle area feature represention","Cities and towns;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Microcomputers;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set;SVM classifier;attack type detection;information gain method;intentional attacks;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering algorithm;personal computer system;single machine learning algorithm;triangle area support vector machine;unsupervised machine learning technology","","4","","13","","","22-24 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But for large-scale network intrusion detection problem, since solving a support vector machine is a typical quadratic optimization problem, which is influenced by the dimension and quantity of examples, many problems arise. KDDCUP'99 was used as the experiment dataset in this paper. A feature selection technology based on Fisher score was presented and used to construct a reduced feature subset of KDDCUP'99 dataset. SVM was used as a classifier. Experiment was run. The experiment results show, using Fisher score combined with SVM to select the important features is an effective method to reduce the dimension of the example feature space, and the classification accuracy has not dramatically decreased comparing to the original feature space.","","1-4244-0462-2;1424404622","","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149722","","Buildings;Data communication;Diversity reception;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Pattern classification;Statistics;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","security of data;support vector machines","Fisher score;feature selection technology;large-scale network intrusion detection problem;optimization problem;support vector machine","","4","","12","","","25-27 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
