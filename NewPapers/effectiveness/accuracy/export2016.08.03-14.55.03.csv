However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1092-1648;10921648","978-1-4244-1587-8;9781424415878","978-1-4244-1588-5;9781424415885","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","13","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel idea of correlating discovered short sequential patterns based on intrusion prerequisite and intrusion intention is proposed to build long sequential patterns. As to the on-line part of intrusion behavior forecast system, it employs inference engine developed in this paper to forecast intrusion behavior based on intrusion preludes and to discover forecast rules.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","2166-9570;21669570","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6666573","","Cognitive radio;Noise;Principal component analysis;Probability;Resilience;Security;Sensors","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","CRAWDAD data repository;catastrophic performance degradation;cognitive radio networks;denial of service;genuine node failures;intelligent jamming;multidimensional cooperative spectrum sensing technique;multiple criteria analysis technique;nonparametric Bayesian inference method;physical layer;primary user emulation;spectrum holes;spectrum usage efficiency","","0","","16","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9;9781457713859","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","4","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","3","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning.

Anomaly detection systems have success in exposing new attacks, commonly referred to as `zero' day attacks, yet have high false positive rates. False positive events occur when an activity is flagged for investigation yet it was determined to be benign upon analysis. Computational power and valuable resources are wasted when the irrelevant data is processed, data flagged, analyst alerted, and the irrelevant data is finally disregarded. In an effort to make intrusion detection systems more efficient the false positive rate must be reduced.

A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time.

"Correlated Differential Privacy: Hiding Information in Non-IID Data Set","T. Zhu; P. Xiong; G. Li; W.

Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2368363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949097","Correlated Dataset;Differential Privacy;Non-IID Dataset;Privacy Preserving;Privacy preserving;correlated dataset;differential privacy;non-IID dataset","Correlation;Couplings;Data privacy;Histograms;Noise;Privacy;Sensitivity","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;iterative methods","correlated data releasing mechanism;correlated data set;correlated differential privacy solution;correlated information;correlated iteration mechanism;correlated levels;correlated sensitivity;data mining;data release;influential privacy notion;information hiding;iterative method;non-IID data set;privacy guarantee;privacy preserving;privacy violation;traditional global sensitivity","","0","","17","","2014-11-06","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","2","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed.

Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","978-1-4244-2067-4;9781424420674","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","5","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These cyber devices may be tightly coupled with the physical processes they control and human induced failures risk dire real-world consequences. Dynamic virtual honeypots are effective tools for observing and attracting network intruder activity. This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices. The AB system alerted on 100% of the monitored emulated devices.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2014.2304633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750078","Industrial control;intrusion detection;network security","Control systems;Emulation;Monitoring;Operating systems;Ports (Computers);Security;XML","XML;control engineering computing;security of data;sensors","AB;anomaly behavior system;campus grid;collaborative usage scenario;cyber-physical system security;deceptive virtual hosts;ettercap XML output;honeyd configuration;human induced failures risk;industrial control network administrators;network entity information gathering;network intruder activity;network stack behaviors;physical processes;real-world consequences;self-configuring honeypots;sensor network","","2","","39","","2014-02-27","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders.

In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation.

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs.

In this paper we introduce FloTracker that is an online log-free host-based root-cause analysis detection engine, with instantaneous forensics capabilities. FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such a centralized approach is not flexible nor is it robust. For example, it is very hard to find an appropriate system to which the user can upload information during a disaster, and the centralized server may be down because of overload or has been physically destroyed. We must consider a distributed and dynamic architecture for the system.

We demonstrate that VNF characterization is vital for optimizing VNF performance, as well as efficient utilization of infrastructure resources.

Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a repuation system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4244-7834-7;9781424478347","","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949798","","Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling;Pattern recognition;Peer to peer computing","computer network security;multi-agent systems;telecommunication traffic","autonomous multiagent design;computer network protection;flow-based ID;flow-based intrusion detection;malicious network activity classification;malicious traffic;network attack classification;signature-based ID","","2","2","17","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, recent countermeasures are focusing on after intrusion such as an incident response. We previously proposed a system in order to support network administrators performing incident responses. However, our previous system uses only anomaly detection technique to detect signs of cyber attacks so that we may overlook some signs. In addition, we bother with a lot of unimportant detection reports including many false positives. Our previous system deals with detected malware one by one. Such behavior cannot cope with various situations of incidents. As a solution, this paper proposes an incident response support system based on seriousness of infection. The system combines various types of detection techniques and raises the large number of detection report. To manage detection reports, we define Infection Suspicious Level (ISL) that represents degree of suspicious about malware infection. By assigning ISL to all network segments, the system performs appropriate monitoring, analysis, and takes countermeasure semi-automatically based on ISL. The proposed system can raise a number of detection reports, reduce the false positive problem, and provide several strategies against attack.","","","","10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427090","","Access control;Electronic mail;IP networks;Malware;Monitoring;Servers","invasive software","ISL;anomaly detection technique;cyberattacks;incident response support system;infection seriousness;infection suspicious level;intrusion prevention;malware detection","","","","12","","","13-15 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour.

Since each device in the network has measurement and estimation limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. The system decides whether user authentication (or IDS input) is required and which biosensors (or IDSs) should be chosen, depending on the security posture.

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7;9781467326247","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","38","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems. We have collected real user behavior data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct these feature vectors. These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors. We have tested our technique with various feature vector parameters and conclude that these feature vectors can provide unique and comprehensive user behavior information and are powerful enough to detect masqueraders","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652076","","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","GUI based systems;computer system illegitimate activity;graphical user interface;impersonation attack;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;support vector machine;user identification","","6","","34","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are then able to extract the highly popular files and identify worm/malware files within them with high accuracy.","","978-1-4244-9719-5;9781424497195","978-0-7695-4322-2;9780769543222","10.1109/EUC.2010.133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703577","Detection;Peer-to-Peer;Worm","","Internet;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","Gnutella P2P network;Internet;malware detection;passive worm detection;peer-to-peer networks;security threats","","0","","17","","","11-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it also brings new challenges for security and access control, especially in IaaS clouds. The introduction of virtualization layer increases new security risks which should be restricted and confined by more stringent access control techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines. A VMM-based access control mechanism is designed to confine the VM's behaviors in a fine-grained manner. Ihac is implemented and evaluated in iVIC platform. The experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective and efficient.","","","","10.1109/UCC.2014.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027606","IaaS cloud;hybrid access control;virtual machine","Authorization;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;virtual machines","IaaS clouds;Internet;RBAC;VMM;authorization;cloud computing;hybrid access control framework;iHAC;permission transition model;resource sharing;role-based access control;security risk;type enforcement model;virtual machine;virtualization layer","","0","","19","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed.

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Hidden Markov Model based on Viterbi algorithm to detect distributed denial of service attacks in data communication networks.

Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced ice age) that allows us to imitate the Internet.

The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2517321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383218","Smart city;attack detection;chance discovery;software-defined networking;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Access control;Base stations;Hierarchical systems;Sensors;Smart cities;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;smart cities;software defined networking;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks","UCON technology;WSN hierarchical security framework;advanced persistent threat detection;chance discovery technology;dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism;high-level attacks;isolated defense component;low-level attack detection;network function virtualization;resource consumption;resource-restrained wireless sensor network;smart cities;smart services;software defined networking;sophisticated attacks;unknown attack detection;usage control technology","","","","35","","2016-01-14","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950;08858950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","6","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The paper shows how synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length. In other word, for a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is subdivided in to up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters. Synergistic radar technology can be applied to buried, surface, wall and roof applications. This intrusion location capability also applies to each of these applications","","0-7803-5965-8;0780359658","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891162","","Cameras;Coaxial cables;Costs;Intrusion detection;Radar;Radio broadcasting;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Security;Space technology","access control;radar applications;radar signal processing","camera pre-set positioning accuracy;individual sensitivity level;intrusion location capability;outdoor security;synergistic radar technology;temporary sub-zone disabling","","2","","7","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new outlier detection algorithm called Weighted Distance Based Outlier Detection (WDBOD) algorithm to detect the intruders in wireless environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the detection accuracy and reduces the false alarm rate.","","978-1-4577-0588-5;9781457705885","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972372","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET);Weighted Distance Based Outlier Detection (WDBOD)","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Support vector machines","computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing","MANET;intelligent system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;outlier detection algorithms;weighted distance based outlier detection algorithm;wireless environment","","0","","18","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection engine of the system is based on the incremental mining of fuzzy association rules from network packets, in which membership functions of fuzzy variables are optimized by a genetic algorithm. The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection. Moreover, a mechanism for dynamic firewall updating is embedded in the proposed system for the function of eliminating suspicious connections when necessary.","2158-9178;21589178","978-1-4244-8095-1;9781424480951","978-0-7695-4190-7;9780769541907","10.1109/ISPA.2010.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634386","Fuzzy association rules;anomaly detection;genetic algorithm;membership functions;online incremental mining","Association rules;Biological cells;Databases;Floods;Genetics;IP networks;Intrusion detection","computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","LAN;anomaly traffic;firewall update;flooding attack;fuzzy association rules;genetic algorithm;incremental mining;online response system","","0","","18","","","6-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Commonly this task is performed by antivirus software tools that rely on prior explicit knowledge of the worm's code, which is represented by signatures. We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality.","2161-4393;21614393","0-7803-9490-9;0780394909","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716409","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Classification tree analysis;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Laboratories;Magnetic heads;Software tools","decision trees;invasive software;neural nets;pattern classification","artificial neural networks;classifications techniques;computer worm detection;decision tree;k-nearest neighbors","","2","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
