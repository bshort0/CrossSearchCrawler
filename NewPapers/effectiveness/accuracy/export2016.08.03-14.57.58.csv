Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","2164-4357;21644357","978-1-4673-5137-9;9781467351379","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These problems lead to defense systems requiring various detection methods in order to identify attacks. Moreover, DDoS attacks can mix their traffics during flash crowds. By doing this, the complex defense system cannot detect the attack traffic in time. In this paper, we propose a behavior based detection that can discriminate DDoS attack traffic from traffic generated by real users. By using Pearson's correlation coefficient, our comparable detection methods can extract the repeatable features of the packet arrivals.

In the past decades, these systems were isolated and use proprietary software, operating systems, and protocols. In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained. Cost - Benefit analysis is done for the various attack detection methods and the ROC curves are also plotted.","","978-1-4673-5037-2;9781467350372","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528514","Attack Detection;Classification;Cost-Benefit Analysis and ROC Curve;Intrusion Detection;Layered Approach","Accuracy;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","Bayes methods;cost-benefit analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;trees (mathematics)","CFS;DoS;IDS;J48;KStar;Naive Bayes;Probe;R2L;ROC curves;RandomSubspace;RotationForest;U2R;correlation based feature selection;cost-benefit analysis;data near BalancedND;enhanced attack detection methods;feature selection;information assets;intrusion detection systems;layered approach;multiclass classifier;multiple learning based classifiers;ordinal class classifier;random forest;random tree;security infrastructure;security systems;system administrators","","1","","7","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, we introduce a component called a dynamic threat profiler that periodically learns the changing nature of threats in a network. We model and prove the efficacy of the threat-aware signature based intrusion detection approach for obtaining network-specific useful alarms. We also present our architecture and discuss its internal functions. Finally, we present our experiments based on various threat scenarios and the results obtained, which show that network-specific useful alarms formed 95 percent of the alarms that were generated using our model, when compared with the traditional signature-based detection engine where useful alarms form only 30 percent of the generated alarms.","","978-0-7695-3189-2;9780769531892","978-0-7695-3189-2;9780769531892","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561330","","Cities and towns;IP networks;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Protocols;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","mobile computing;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dynamic threat profiler;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network-specific useful alarms;signature based detection engine;threat-aware signature","","1","","14","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3;9781479923533","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved.

This paper concerns detecting DoS attacks using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The key idea is to train SVMs using already discovered patterns (signatures) that represent DoS attacks. Using a benchmark data from a KDD competition designed by DARPA (U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), we demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate classifiers can be constructed by using SVMs to detect DoS attacks. Further, we also perform feature ranking of the DARPA intrusion data to identify the key features that are important to DoS detection.","","0-7803-7810-5;0780378105","","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206607","","Computer crime;Computer science;Detectors;Humans;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Internet;security of data;support vector machines","DARPA defense advanced research projects agency;Internet accessibility;Internet complexity;Internet openness;SVM support vector machines;denial of service attacks detection;information system security;intrusion data;legitimate users","","13","","36","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A specific attack called Wormmhole attack enables an attacker to record packets at one location in the network, tunnels them to another location, and retransmits them into the network. In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route. The destination node detects the wormhole if the hop difference between neighbours of the nodes exceeds the acceptable level. Our simulation results shows that the WHOP is quite excellent in detecting wormhole of large tunnel lengths.","","978-1-4577-0311-9;9781457703119","","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5893822","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Synchronization","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;synchronisation","MANET routing;WHOP;clock synchronisation;directional antenna;hound packet;malicious activity;routing protocol;wormhole attack detection protocol","","9","","15","","","25-27 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do so, two feedforward neural networks architectures (one for non fuzzified data, the other for fuzzified data) are suggested, and their behaviors in detecting the attacks are studied.

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality.

In a general sense, the proposed system is a co-located sensor network, in which the monitored variable is the health of the network being monitored. A three level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (intrusion detection systems) are attached to each node of the MANET, collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the difference between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which fuses the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Likewise, cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager node, which fuses the cluster-level indexes into a network-level anomaly index. Due to network mobility, cluster membership and cluster heads are time varying. The paper describes: (1) clustering algorithms to update cluster centers; (2) machine learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes; (3) a statistical scheme for fusing the anomaly indexes at the cluster heads and at the manager. The statistical scheme is formally shown to increase detection accuracy under idealized assumptions. These algorithms were implemented and tested under the following conditions. Routing schemes: AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing) and OLSR (optimized link state routing); mobility patterns: random walk mobility model and reference point group mobility at various speeds; types of attacks: traffic flooding denial-of-service and black hole. For performance evaluation we determined the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) for various operational conditions at the nodes, cluster heads and manager. The overall res- - ults confirm the effectiveness of the infrastructures and algorithms described in the paper, with detection accuracy generally improving as we move up in the hierarchy, i.e. detection accuracy at the cluster level is higher than at local level, while network-level detection outperforms cluster-level detection","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605939","","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic heads;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services;wireless sensor networks","(optimized link state routing;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;black hole;cluster head;cluster membership;cluster-level anomaly index;colocated sensor network;computer attacks;data collection;data processing;data transmission;distributed anomaly;intrusion detection;local anomaly indexes;machine learning algorithms;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobility patterns;network mobility;random walk mobility model;receiver operating characteristics;reference point group mobility;statistical scheme;three level hierarchical system;traffic flooding denial-of-service","","10","","21","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also attackers make greater use of encrypted protocols to hide from detection and to hinder investigations. Currently, most security systems (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and firewalls) cannot effectively analyze encrypted traffic. This results in blind spots, which can put the security of a whole environment at risk. In this paper, we propose a system that is capable of investigating encrypted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. In the first step the private RSA key of the RDP server is used to decrypt the TLS/SSL layer of the RDP stream. In the second step our system extracts all relevant information (e.g., keystrokes and transferred files) from the RDP connection. This information makes it possible to reconstruct the behavior and the activities of an attacker with a high accuracy. For the evaluation of our approach we performed a scan of 231,025 internet facing RDP systems and revealed that over 95 % of the RDP connections to these systems can be decrypted with our system.","","","","10.1109/PDP.2016.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445394","RDP;Remote Desktop Protocol;analyze RDP;decrypt TLS/SSL;reconstruct user activities","Ciphers;Data mining;Protocols;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;cryptographic protocols;firewalls;public key cryptography","IDS;Internet;RDP connections;TLS/SSL layer;encrypted network connections;encrypted protocols;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;private RSA key;remote desktop protocol traffic;security systems;transferred data confidentiality","","","","11","","","17-19 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the affirmative results, this technique can serve beyond the detection of Denial of Service (DoS) and with sufficient development; an automated defensive solution can be achieved.","","978-1-4244-5726-7;9781424457267","978-1-4244-5727-4;9781424457274","10.1109/ICCSN.2010.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437603","ARIMA;Denial of Service;Forecasting;Intrusion Detection;Network Security","Alarm systems;Communication system software;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Pattern matching;Physics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Web services;autoregressive moving average processes;computer network security","ARIMA based network anomaly detection;Web service;automated defensive solution;automated network management software;autoregressive integrated moving average technique;denial of service;early warning system;potential attacks detection;software as a service","","6","","8","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics. Simulation of these classification models has been performed using 10-fold cross validation.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate. We examine a number of tradeoffs in choosing the threshold values by simulating network traffic.

In this paper, an efficient intrusion detection model is introduced. The model uses intelligent techniques to detect intrusions. Two different architectures are introduced. The first architecture represents the level of sensor node, sink node, and base station. The second architecture represents the levels of sensor and sink nodes. This work proposes two intrusion detection algorithms, one uses a supervised learning mechanism to be used on the level of the sensor node and the other uses an unsupervised learning mechanism to be used on the levels of both the sink node and base station. The output of the algorithms is a set of detection rules which are structured in the form of binary tree. The introduced algorithms provided a high detection accuracy using less number of selected features, compared to previous work for intrusion detection, which decreases the complexity and the processing time. The proposed learning algorithms used only 10% of the data for training. An enhancement for J48 classification algorithm is also introduced which decreases the size of the algorithm's decision tree and makes it suitable to be used for intrusion detection in WSNs.","","978-1-4799-8660-6;9781479986606","","10.1109/NGMAST.2015.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373249","Classification;Clustering;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks Security;feature selection","Base stations;Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Unsupervised learning;Wireless sensor networks","decision trees;security of data;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","J48 classification algorithm;base station;binary tree;decision tree;distributed intrusion detection system;intelligent techniques;sensor node;sink node;unsupervised learning mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","8","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem, called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection, the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs. However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom filters--which were originally designed for encoding binary membership information--are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter, we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2536618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431999","Computational efficiency;approximation algorithms;compression algorithms.","Arrays;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Memory management;Random access memory","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS.

Energy consumption data can be hidden and altered through cyber-attacks that are characterized by the unauthorized access to the application database and digital tampering of smart meters. The development of cost-efficient algorithms to address these types of non-technical losses also targets the reduction of commercial losses because the full protection of an information system is very expensive. Thus, this work proposes a strategy to detect non-technical losses using a multivariate control chart that establishes a reliable region for monitoring the measured variance. After the detection of non-technical losses, a pathfinding procedure based on the A-Star algorithm is able to locate the consumption point with the non-technical loss. Moreover, a geographical information system application displays the consumption point that is the target of the cyber-attack.

In this system, a wireless webcam attached with a hyperbolic mirror is used to capture the omnidirectional scene at health care centers.

Current research focuses concentrate on how to effective reduce high false alarm rate and usually ignore the fact that the poor quality data for the modeling of normal patterns as well as the high computational cost make the current anomaly detection methods not act as well as we expect. Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the data reduction mechanisms would greatly improve the performance of TCM-KNN and make it be a good candidate for anomaly detection in practice.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267564","Anomaly Detection;Data Reduction;Network Security;TCM-KNN Algorithm","Computational efficiency;Conferences;Costs;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Testing","data mining;data reduction;genetic algorithms;security of data;telecommunication security","computational cost;data mining scheme;data reduction mechanism;filter based feature selection methods;genetic algorithm;instance selection;network anomaly detection scheme","","3","","15","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the practical use of defensive mechanisms such as CAPTCHAs and spam filters, attackers and defenders exchange 'victories,' each celebrating (temporary) success in breaking and defending. In this paper, since most of these defensive mechanisms depend on a single algorithm as a defence mechanism, we present a confusion matrix that helps to understand how a defensive mechanism performs a correct/incorrect classification. Specifically, the expected results, of a defensive mechanism from the confusion matrix, lead to categorising defensive mechanisms into two main categories: Assertive and Predictive defensive mechanisms. Moreover, the predicted results of a predictive defensive mechanism can be divided into two types: Interactive and non-Interactive defensive mechanisms. The result of this categorization scheme is useful to interested parties such as researchers, defensive mechanism designers and developers, as a tool to classify a defensive mechanism. Also, the view of interactive defensive mechanisms (IDMs) is important and useful, since it provides a consistent and clear understanding of the problem of IDMs in a system. Having such a view enables various interested parties, such as researchers, defensive mechanism design and defensive mechanism developers, to work from the same reference point, which is as unambiguous as possible.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396478","categorization;defensive mechanism;interactive defensive mechanism;non-interactive defensive mechanisms;security","CAPTCHAs;Classification algorithms;Computers;Filtering algorithms;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Security","information filters;matrix algebra;pattern classification;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","CAPTCHA;IDM;appropriate categorisation;assertive defensive mechanism;categorization scheme;confusion matrix;defence mechanism;defensive mechanism design;defensive mechanism developer;incorrect classification;interactive defensive mechanism;predictive defensive mechanism;secure defensive mechanism;spam filter;system resource","","","","32","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties.

One of the major concerns of the development is its latency delay. Host-based IDS systems inspecting log files provided by operating systems or applications need more time to analyze log content. It demands a large number of computer resources, such as CPU time and memory. Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS. It is a self-organized and self-training system. Furthermore, we discover cooperative attacks submitted by users at the same time by using data mining and forensic techniques.","","0-7803-7882-2;0780378822","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297623","","Application software;Computer displays;Data mining;Delay;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Real time systems","computer crime;data mining;real-time systems;safety systems","data mining;forensic techniques;host-based real-time intrusion detection system;intelligent monitor;user profile","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both hardware accelerated and parallel software-based NIDS solutions, based on commodity multi-core and GPU processors, have been proposed to overcome these challenges. This work explores new parallel opportunities afforded by many-core processors for high performance, scalable and inexpensive NIDS. We exploit the huge many-core computational power by adopting a hybrid parallel architecture combining data and pipeline parallelism. We also design a hybrid load balancing scheme, using both ruleset and flow space partitioning. Furthermore, the proposed design leverages particular features of the processor to break the bottlenecks. We have integrated the open source NIDS Suricata into our proposed design and evaluated its performance with synthetic traffic. The prototype exhibits almost linear speedup and can handle up to 7.2 Gbps traffic with 100-bytes packets.","","978-1-4799-1640-5;9781479916405","","10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665196","load balancing;many-core;network intrusion detection system;parallel","Data structures;Engines;Instruction sets;Load management;Protocols;Tiles","","","","4","","29","","","21-22 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The TCP traffic dynamic behaviour, which is represented by a TCP/IP fluid-flow model, can be captured by the observer in the router level. A smooth control signal for the observer based on the fast TSM strategy is obtained and directly used to estimate the additional traffic dynamic in TCP/IP networks. The effectiveness and capability of the proposed methodology are evaluated in Network Simulator.","","","","10.1109/ICIT.2015.7125071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7125071","","IP networks;Internet;Manifolds;Mathematical model;Observers;Protocols;Quality of service","Internet;observers;queueing theory;telecommunication control;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;variable structure systems","FTSM observer;Network Simulator;TCP traffic dynamic behaviour;TCP/IP fluid-flow model;TCP/IP network anomaly traffic detection;fast terminal sliding mode observer;queue dynamics;router level;smooth control signal","","1","","26","","","17-19 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel entropy-based DDoS attack detection approach by constructing entropy vectors of different features from traffic flows, modeling normal patterns using clustering analysis algorithm, and then detecting deviations from the created models. Compared to traditional work, our method differs by selecting more comprehensive features to construct clustering models, and setting detection thresholds automatically based on the traffic models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only outperform traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy, but also show certain availability in actual application environment.","","978-1-4673-8659-3;9781467386593","","10.1109/CIS.2015.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397119","DDoS attack detection;clustering;flow entropy","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Measurement;Training;Training data","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DDoS attack detection;clustering analysis algorithm;clustering technique;distributed denial-of-service;entropy-based approach;flow entropy;network security;traffic volume-based method","","","","14","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, mobile network access underscores the need for energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a new way to improve the throughput and to reduce the energy consumption of an anomaly-based intrusion detection system for probing attacks. Our framework implements the same classifier algorithm in software (C++) and in hardware (synthesizable VHDL), and then compares the energy efficiency of the two approaches. Our results for a decision tree classifier show that the hardware version consumed only 0.03% of the energy used by the same algorithm in software, even though the hardware version operates with a throughput that is 15 times that of the software version.","2159-3469;21593469","978-1-4799-3763-9;9781479937639","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2014.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903406","FPGA;anomaly-based detection;decision tree classifier;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Power demand;Power measurement;Software;Support vector machine classification;Vectors","decision trees;hardware description languages;pattern classification;power aware computing;radio networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decision tree classifier;energy consumption;energy efficiency analysis;mobile network;network protection;software classifier algorithm;software-based network security;synthesizable VHDL","","1","","15","","","9-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
