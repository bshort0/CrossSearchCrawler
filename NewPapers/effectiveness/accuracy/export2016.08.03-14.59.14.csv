As the heart of modern air traffic control, it will play an essential role in the protection of two billion passengers per year, in addition to being crucial to many other interest groups in aviation. The inherent lack of security measures in the ADS-B protocol has long been a topic in both the aviation circles and in the academic community. Due to recently published proof-of-concept attacks, the topic is becoming ever more pressing, particularly with the deadline for mandatory implementation in most airspaces fast approaching. This survey first summarizes the attacks and problems that have been reported in relation to ADS-B security. Thereafter, it surveys both the theoretical and practical efforts that have been previously conducted concerning these issues, including possible countermeasures. In addition, the survey seeks to go beyond the current state of the art and gives a detailed assessment of security measures that have been developed more generally for related wireless networks such as sensor networks and vehicular ad hoc networks, including a taxonomy of all considered approaches.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2365951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940209","ADS-B;NextGen;air traffic control;air traffic management;aviation;broadcast;security;wireless","Aircraft;Jamming;Protocols;Radar;Security;Surveillance;Wireless communication","air traffic control;broadcasting;protocols","ADS-B protocol;ADS-B security;air traffic control;automatic-dependent surveillance-broadcast protocol security;communication protocol;next-generation air transportation systems;sensor networks;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless networks","","3","","118","","2014-10-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Additionally, the IDSs can perform other functions like intrusion prevention (IPS), including proactive functions. A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time. The paper also makes an analysis of the features used to classify data in order to define which of them are really relevant for each class of attack defined in our experiments.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546735","Artifitial Neural Network;Internet Security;Intrusion Detection System;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Support vector machines;Training","","","","11","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As use of these devices becomes more widespread, the need to protect them becomes more important. In this research, the RF-DNA fingerprinting method is examined to protect these devices using their physical layer attributes. In particular, the traditional method of using parametric features such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis is challenged with the use of non-parametric features mean, median, mode and linear regression coefficient estimates. With careful analysis of variables, a 71% reduction in features is achieved while attaining >94% correct classification rate at an 8 dB lower SNR than using traditional parametric features.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357472","","Authentication;Linear regression;Performance evaluation;Signal to noise ratio;Training","Internet of Things;regression analysis;security of data","Internet connected devices;Internet of Things technologies;RF-DNA fingerprinting method;Z-Wave fingerprinting;building control;device interoperability;equipment monitoring;health care;kurtosis;linear regression coefficient estimation;median;mode;nonparametric features mean;nonparametric statistical feature;parametric statistical feature;physical layer attributes;skewness;smart energy;variance","","","","17","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such solution to the problem. There are many research works focused in the area of signature based anomaly based IDS. Based on these malicious activities there is a need of addressing a new or modified versions of IDS algorithm.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a potential network security solution for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and information resources. A fast and effective IDS for mobile networks that does not violate the user's privacy or the network's QoS is required. This paper offers a set of flow-based features that can be utilized for mobile network traffic as a prerequisite for a privacy-aware and QoS-robust IDS. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used for reduction of the features. Twelve features in six groups, which represent the user data in mobile traffic, were extracted and evaluated for IDSs. The evaluation process achieved a F-measure weighted average equal to 0.834, and the experimental time was equal to 12.9 seconds. The accomplished measurements have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed set of features.","","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500483","Internet of Things (IoT) security;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs);feature extraction;mobile traffic","Feature extraction;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunications","mobile communication;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PCA;QoS;flow-based features;intrusion detection system;mobile network traffic;mobile networks;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile traffic;network security;principal component analysis;security risks;threat detection systems;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done.

Data mining has shown great potential in extracting valuable knowledge from large databases. However, current data mining algorithms and tools are costly and several are too complex in their operations when dealing with large databases. In recent years, agents have become a popular paradigm in computing, because its autonomous, flexible and provides intelligence. Embedding agents in the current data mining processes and tools are believed to be able to solve the obstacle. One of the most important process in data mining is data preprocessing. It is reported that 60% of the data mining project is on preprocessing. Data preprocessing involves integration, selection, cleaning and transformation of data set that will be used for mining. This paper focuses on an agent-based preprocessing framework. The aims is to provides an auto preprocessing a set of new data, which suite to data mining novice user. The proposed agent based preprocessing framework consists of seven agents: user interface agents, coordinator agent, identify agent, CleanMiss agent, CleanNoisy agent, transformation agent and discretization agent. User interface agent is designed in such a way to provide interface suite to novice users. Coordinator agent is responsible for coordinating and cooperating with all other agents to achieve the goals. Identify agent responsible to provide an adaptive user data cleaning profiling. CleanMiss agent, CleanNoisy agent, transformation agent and discretization agent provide various types of techniques autonomously, which ended with proposing the best cleaning techniques from various types of techniques to keep in the preprocessing profile.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6214-6;9781467362146","","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Access Logs;Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Electronic Health Records;Healthcare Security;Insider threats","Context;Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","LDA;ROA model;RTA;RTAD;anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;anomalous user detection;anomaly detection framework;attacker characteristics;feature extraction;healthcare;hospital audit logs;information systems;insider threat detection;k-NN algorithm;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;model formalization;outlier detection;random object access model;random record access;random topic access detection;random topic access model;random users;statistics;strategy development;topic summarization;user roles;workflow knowledge","","0","","13","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, an increased accuracy is needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to find optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a reasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization service, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the infrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an adaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical location estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about solving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models.

It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.","","978-1-4244-3782-5;9781424437825","978-4-9904-2590-6;9784990425906","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045945","Command sequence;Customized grammar;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Masquerade detection;N-gram;Self signature;Uniqueness;Unix","Application software;Computer applications;Computer industry;Data security;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines","Unix;authorisation;grammars;statistical analysis","Greenberg data;IDS;Schonlau data;Unix command sequence;anomaly detection;command frequency;command sequence grammar;customized grammars;firewall;masquerade detection;misuse-based intrusion detection;self signature approach;statistical methods","","1","","18","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security model in wired networks is not suited for WSNs because of their energy constraints. In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS. The simulation results show that our ADS is able to achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283101","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Gene expression;Hidden Markov models;Mathematics;Predictive models;Programming profession;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","genetic algorithms;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;time series;wireless sensor networks","GEP-ADS algorithm;GEP-based lightweight anomaly detection scheme;WSN trust;energy constraint;energy consumption;gene expression programming;intrusion detection scheme;routing attack;security model;simulation result;time series method;traffic prediction model;wired network;wireless sensor network reliability","","0","","16","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead. We have developed a prototype that was evaluated in AODV-enabled networks using the ns-2 network simulator.","","0-7695-2342-0;0769523420","","10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443525","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Data security;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;knowledge based systems;minimisation;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","knowledge-based techniques;minimisation;mobile ad hoc networks;network topologies;real-time intrusion detection;secure routing protocol","","12","","14","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some redundant sample points and noisy points are firstly removed in this paper according to the distance in high-dimensional feature space. And K-nearest neighbor algorithm guarantees sample points removed is the noise points. Then the remaining sample points provide an SVM with high quality samples that likely to carry most of the support vectors(SVs) such that they maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. Because different network protocols have different attributes, which must affect the detection effect. This paper proposes cooperative network intrusion detection based on SVMs. Three types of detecting agents are generated according to TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol.

Meanwhile, due to the unstable wireless channel in WSNs, the packet loss rate during the communication of sensor nodes may be high and vary from time to time. It poses a great challenge to distinguish the malicious drop and normal packet loss. In this paper, we propose a channel-aware reputation system with adaptive detection threshold (CRS-A) to detect selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. The CRS-A evaluates the data forwarding behaviors of sensor nodes, according to the deviation of the monitored packet loss and the estimated normal loss. To optimize the detection accuracy of CRS-A, we theoretically derive the optimal threshold for forwarding evaluation, which is adaptive to the time-varied channel condition and the estimated attack probabilities of compromised nodes. Furthermore, an attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme is developed to collaborate with CRS-A for stimulating the forwarding cooperation of compromised nodes and improving the data delivery ratio of the network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CRS-A can accurately detect selective forwarding attacks and identify the compromised sensor nodes, while the attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme can significantly improve the data delivery ratio of the network.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2526601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401098","Wireless sensor network;channel-aware;packet dropping;reputation system;routing;selective forwarding attack;wireless sensor network","Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Packet loss;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","CRS-A;WSN;adaptive aware detection;adaptive detection threshold;attack-tolerant data forwarding scheme;channel aware detection;forwarding packets;information integrity;monitored packet loss;selective forwarding attacks;sensor nodes;time-varied channel condition;wireless channel;wireless sensor networks","","","","35","","2016-02-08","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic.

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as safe or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic in the dark.","2330-9881;23309881","978-1-4577-1481-8;9781457714818","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, the LR attack considering the attack and defense is modeled by bilevel optimization. Game-theoretic approaches are developed to model the interaction of the attacker and defender for two scenarios for defending critical measurements and for defending critical substations. The attack and defense interaction is modeled by a zero-sum game if only the load curtailment is considered in the utility functions. And it can be modeled by a non-zero-sum game if both the load curtailment and the associated attack cost and defense cost are considered. The proposed approach is tested based on a representative IEEE 14-bus system, and optimal defense strategies are derived in different scenarios.

However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Carrier cloud;Machine type communications (MTC);mobile cloud networking;network function virtualization (NFV)","Logic gates;Machine-to-machine communications;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Object recognition;Protocols;Radio access networks;Servers","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","3GPP;LightEPC framework;MTC;NFV;cloud computing;cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks;machine type communications;network function virtualization;network node failures","","7","","27","","2014-09-22","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an architecture and approach for leveraging the virtualization technology at the core of cloud computing to perform intrusion detection security using hypervisor performance metrics. Through the use of virtual machine performance metrics gathered from hypervisors, such as packets transmitted/received, block device read/write requests, and CPU utilization, we demonstrate and verify that suspicious activities can be profiled without detailed knowledge of the operating system running within the virtual machines.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

The handover process, consisting of discovery, registration, and packet forwarding, has a large overhead and disrupts connectivity. With increased handover frequency and smaller access point dwell times in vehicular networks, the handover causes a large degradation in performance. This paper proposes a predictive handover protocol, using a combination of a Kalman filter and an online hidden Markov model, to minimize the effects of prediction errors and to capitalize on advanced handover registration. Extensive simulated experiments were carried out in NS-2 to study the performance of the proposed protocol within a variety of traffic and network topology scenarios.

Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems.

Therefore, in this study, we use a semi-supervised method to address the problem of the limitation of labelled data. S4VM is a semi-supervised method which can work with both labelled and unlabelled data. This method is used in this study to detect anomalies in flow traffic. The results show that S4VM has high accuracy when a large proportion of data is unlabelled. Although the accuracy of S4VM is slightly less than supervised learning, this method reduces the cost of labeling data, as only a small number of labelled flows are required.

Extracting log message formats is an important and necessary step to achieve the goal. However, it is time-consuming and costly to automatically and efficiently extract log message formats from massive network and security logs of many different types, which are generated by the increasing number of network and security devices and services used in large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose log template extraction (LTE), an approach that is semantics aware of network and security logs to address the problem. LTE first cleans log messages and then clusters the cleaned log messages based on the DBSCAN algorithm. At last it infers message templates by LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm. We evaluate our work on massive amount of network log messages collected from a large production network. Experimental results show that LTE approach infers and gets multiple log message formats at the same time with more than 90% accuracy and 100% recall.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357664","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Reverse engineering;Security","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;computer network security;pattern clustering","DBSCAN algorithm;LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm;LTE;large-scale network environments;log template extraction;network anomaly diagnosis;network format extraction;security log message;semantics aware","","","","23","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose Predictive Mutual Information (PMI), a hybrid measure of relevance not only is based on MI but also accounts for predictability of signals from one another as in KCCA. We show that PMI has more improved feature detection capability than MI and KCCA, especially in catching suspicious coincidences that are rare but potentially important not only for subsequent experimental studies but also for building computational predictive models which is demonstrated on two toy datasets and a real intrusion detection system dataset.","1051-4651;10514651","978-1-4244-7542-1;9781424475421","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.1060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597870","","Accuracy;Biomedical measurements;Correlation;Entropy;Joints;Kernel;Mutual information","correlation theory;entropy;feature extraction;operating system kernels;security of data;statistical analysis","KCCA;PMI;feature selection algorithm;information entropy;intrusion detection system;kernel canonical correlation analysis;nonlinear correlation measure;predictive mutual information","","2","","9","","","23-26 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results.

In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.","1091-0050;10910050","978-1-4673-1374-2;9781467313742","","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965","NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection","Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data","KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory","","1","","17","","","15-18 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has multiple tasks, which consist of multiple network services aiding the execution of a task. An emerging track of security research has focused on event prioritization and correlation to rank the criticality of events and reduce the number of low-level events. To prioritize and correlate events, the ongoing tasks in an enterprise network are identified, as the goal of network operators is to protect ongoing tasks when a security breach occurs. The prioritization of an event depends on the criticality of an ongoing task that is potentially threatened by the event. Additionally, in order to support network operators, we correlate all events that target the same task. A particular task may depend on multiple network services and involve multiple network devices. So, if one network service becomes unavailable, other network services will be affected over time since they Unfortunately, dependency details are often not documented and are difficult to discover by relying on human expert knowledge. In order to solve this problem, a network dependency analysis based on network traffic is conducted. We rely on pattern mining techniques to discover tasks in a monitored enterprise network. A formal description of the identified tasks is provided and events are prioritized and correlated based on this model.

Anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems have the advantage of being able to detect unknown attacks; they look for patterns that deviate from the normal behavior. We have proposed an approach of anomaly intrusion detection system by using Gaussian mixture model. This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements. Experimental results show that this method is able to reducing the missing alarm. Moreover, this model is a fast method for detecting the unknown attacks.","","978-0-7695-3407-7;9780769534077","","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682192","Anomaly detection;Gaussian Mixture Model;Intrusion Detection;Pattern Matching","Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Maximum likelihood detection;Phase detection;Probability distribution;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Gaussian distribution;maximum likelihood detection;security of data","Gaussian mixture model;Gaussian probability distribution;anomaly intrusion detection system;computer network;maximum likelihood detection;security threat","","2","","9","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
