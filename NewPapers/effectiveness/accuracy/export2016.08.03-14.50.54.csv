However, most of recent approaches can not generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms in environments with noise. In this paper, we present a signature generation algorithm, namely CCSF (color coding signature finding), for polymorphic worms based on color coding. CCSF divides n sequences into m groups and each group contains 20 sequences. Firstly, CCSF generates signatures for each group by adopting color coding and filters them. Then all reserved signatures are clustered to get rid of redundant substrings. In this approach, signature can be generated without any fragment in environments with noise, and it can be used in IDS (intrusion detection system) to detect polymorphic worm. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiment results show distinct advantages in generating accurate signatures over other existed approaches.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198721","","Atherosclerosis;Character generation;Clustering algorithms;Colored noise;Communications Society;Computer worms;Information science;Intrusion detection;Noise generators;Working environment noise","invasive software","CCSF;automated signature generation approach;color coding signature finding;intrusion detection system;polymorphic worm;worm signatures","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Still, the interest of STM has not yet been demonstrated for reactive applications that require bounded response time for some of their operations. We propose to support such applications by allowing the developer to annotate some transaction blocks with deadlines. Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves the chance of a transaction meeting its deadline when its progress is hampered by conflicts.","1530-0889;15300889","978-1-4244-9232-9;9781424492329","978-1-4244-9231-2;9781424492312","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958224","Contention Management;Scheduling;Transactional Memory","Games;Instruction sets;Linux;Optimized production technology;Rendering (computer graphics);Reservoirs;Runtime","Linux;concurrency control;multi-threading;scheduling;shared memory systems;transaction processing","Deadline-Aware Scheduling;Linux scheduler;Software Transactional Memory;concurrency control;conservative execution;parallel programs;thread migration;transaction execution strategy","","1","","25","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks.

The presented system considered the time dimension and built many different classifier models to obtain an accurate analysis of intruders. The obtained results give more focusing and deep understanding of the intruders' behavior during the different time periods and illustrate the shrinking and expansions of intruders' classes over the time slices (the migrations of intruders from one segment to another), The temporal analysis of intruders can help in taking an appropriate decision against specific type of attacks (decisions must be suitable with the intruder behaviour).

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture.

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed.

The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.","","978-1-4673-1937-9;9781467319379","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119","Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting","Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model","","0","","32","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002;15506002","978-1-4244-8078-4;9781424480784","978-0-7695-4131-0;9780769541310","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al.

However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark. Extensive experimental outcome indicates that the proposed BMPNN outperforms other state-of-the-art learning algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and model robustness at an affordable computational cost.","2161-4393;21614393","0-7803-9490-9;0780394909","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716408","Artificial Neural Network;Generalization Variance;Learning Bias;Network Intrusion Detection","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Power system security","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication security","adaptive boosting techniques;boosted modified probabilistic neural network;computer networks;distributed computer systems;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security techniques;semiparametric learning model","","1","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks. Experimental results with three types of neural network architectures clearly show that the optimization of a wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226620","Feature selection;K-means;information gain ratio;intrusion detection systems;neural networks.;wireless networks","","feature extraction;neural net architecture;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;transport protocols;wireless LAN","MAC layer DoS attack;TCP/IP header;feature reduction;hybrid model;k means classifier;lower level protocol frames;network resources;neural network architecture;optimal set;wireless feature set;wireless intrusion detection system","","9","","26","","2009-08-28","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2503399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360925","Bayesian network;cybersecurity;incident prediction;industrial control system (ICS);multiple models;risk assessment","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Industrial control;Risk management","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion detection alarm of the networked system. In such a setting, a question of particular interest to the system administrator is: What is the quantitative security assurance of the networked system?

Current systems implementing intrusion detection processes observe traffic at several data collecting points in the network but analysis is often centralized or partly centralized. These systems are not scalable and suffer from the single point of failure, i.e. attackers only need to target the central node to compromise the whole system. This paper proposes an anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system where analysis is run at each data collecting point using a naive Bayes classifier. Probability values computed by each classifier are shared among nodes using an iterative average consensus protocol.

However, ZigBee protocol has multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present an Anomaly Behavior Analysis System (ABAS) for ZigBee protocol to be used in SBs.

There are some limitations such as reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect sensor nodes. These limitations mostly affect the security of wireless networks. Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for detecting and monitoring selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks.

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead","1072-4451;10724451","0-7695-2732-9;0769527329","","10.1109/MICRO.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841","","Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime","authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring","anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics","","2","","27","","","9-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such approach introduces a single point of failure and uses huge bandwidth for transferring audit data from the data sources to the matching engine. Our approach decomposes an extended infinite state machine, an operational representation of an attack signature, into multiple cooperative finite state machines that enable distributed signature engines to match the signature. We describe the decomposition methodology and the distributed matching algorithm and illustrate them using several example multi-stage attacks in tactical networks.

The impact of attacker behaviors on the effectiveness of a behavior-rule intrusion detection design is investigated. Using HEs, DAPs and SEMs as examples, it is demonstrated that a behavior-rule based intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives for a high detection probability to cope with sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure applications.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some tools and systems are available for the security of digital information. From these tools and systems intrusion detection system is an important method. It is necessary to design good intrusion detection system which will give good accuracy rate, less error rate, which will take minimum time and memory in the performance of the system. This paper presents the two techniques of intrusion detection system. Working of these techniques are based on neural network. For feature extraction in first technique, we are using principal component analysis (PCA) method. In second technique, we are using Bayesian for noise reduction and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for feature extraction.

Using optimal error bounds developed for extended Kalman filters as the comparison basis, we show how wireless signal strength measurements can be used to reliably detect intruders whose true position tracks are far removed from their claimed tracks. We show how the system is immune to malicious attacks that adjust transmitted signal strengths in attempts to circumvent the intrusion detection algorithms. We compare our results with earlier work that utilized static position information as a means for intrusion detection, showing how verification errors determined via tracking can be an order of magnitude smaller. Contrary to the static case, we also show how position verification via tracking is viable in the case where only one access point is within range of the mobile device. Our work outlines the theoretical underpinning of position verification via nonlinear tracking, in addition to providing detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the verification performance.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288932","","Australia;Communication system security;Communications Society;Global Positioning System;Information security;Intrusion detection;Position measurement;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Kalman filters;Monte Carlo methods;filtering theory;mobile radio;nonlinear filters;telecommunication security","Monte Carlo simulations;error verification;extended Kalman filters;location verification;static position information;tracking verification;wireless intrusion detection;wireless signal strength measurements","","6","","23","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DDoS attacks are difficult to be quickly detected. In this paper, we introduce a system that only extracts several important attributes from network traffic for DDoS attack detection in real computer networks. We collect a large set of DDoS attack traffic by implementing various DDoS attacks as well as normal data during normal usage. Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods. Only using several attributes also improves the efficiency in terms of attributes constructing, models training as well as intrusion detection.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-3309-4;9781424433094","","10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757464","Bayesian networks;C4.5;DDoS attack detection;Intrusion detection system;attribute selection","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;DDoS attacks;attribute selection;;distributed denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system","","3","","16","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also briefly outline the design and functions of our SPADE-based multi-agent system, demonstrating its effectiveness at automating multi-path data mining tasks. This code ingests a PCAP, semi-autonomously pre-processes it and feeds it into Weka for processing/mining using several different algorithms.
