A Game Theoretic Approach to Efficient Mixed Strategies for Intrusion Detection,Y. Liu; H. Man; C. Comaniciu,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA. Email: yliu@stevens.edu",2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications,20061211,2006,5,,2201,2206,"As information technology evolves, and as more intrusion detection (ID) techniques are developed, security architects face the problem of effectively integrating various detection techniques to improve overall detection performance while maintain a high level of efficiency in network operation. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.",1550-3607;15503607,1-4244-0355-3;1424403553,1-4244-0355-3;1424403553,10.1109/ICC.2006.255097,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492,,Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads,,,,2,,19,,,6-Jun,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Magnitude and complexity of attacks is continuously growing with every minute development in World Wide Web. There are plenty of web attack detection techniques but they cannot fully comprehend the required degree of security for complex web applications. The reasons include static nature of attack detection mechanism, lack of expressiveness in attack detection rules, and absence of reasoning capability to detect unanticipated ways an attack can be launched. To cater these issues, a formal approach is required that has more expressiveness and equipped with reasoning. These traits are fully adhered to by the Semantic techniques. This paper introduces an approach for utilizing Semantic techniques in web application security. This has never been introduced previously to the best of our knowledge.

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) P<sub>X</sub> based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences. The obtained results are compared with a version of the game in which the pmf P<sub>X</sub> is perfectly known to both the analyst and the adversary.",0018-9448;00189448,,,10.1109/TIT.2014.2325571,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824190,Hypothesis testing;adversarial signal processing;counter-forensics;cybersecurity;game theory;multimedia forensics;source identification,Forensics;Games;Multimedia communication;Nash equilibrium;Testing;Training,game theory;statistical testing,binary hypothesis testing game;decision error;first order statistics;game asymptotic equilibrium;game-theoretic framework;null hypothesis;probability mass function;test sequence,,3,,37,,6/2/2014,Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade.

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous processes may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Switching between processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the processes during the detection process, under reliability constraints.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup.

The feasible Nash equilibrium of the game is reviewed and an analytical framework for the rational attacker and defender is provided for a given set of resources with different security values under some constraints on the attack and monitor resources. In the numerical analysis, it can be shown that by having multiple resources to be attacked and/or monitored simultaneously provides a kind of diversity which helps to improve the belief update of the defender.",2163-0771;21630771,978-1-4673-6048-7;9781467360487,,10.1109/APCC.2013.6765968,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6765968,Game theory;M2M;access control;cloud;intrusion detection,Bayes methods;Games;History;Intrusion detection;Logic gates;Monitoring,authorisation;cloud computing;game theory,IDS;Nash equilibrium;access control system;defender;distributed M2M gateways;distributed M2M local cloud platform;intrusion detection game;intrusion detection system;machine-to-machine system;multistage Bayesian game;rational attacker,,0,,7,,,29-31 Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. Our starting point in this paper is an overall strategy for network resilience, which draws on existing or under development mechanisms, that can be used to maintain acceptable levels of operation in the event of challenges. A crucial part of this strategy is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a new approach to challenge identification that goes beyond current techniques for attack, anomaly or fault detection. We describe our proposed approach in the context of known network challenge scenarios and identify the gaps in the state of the art that our work is filling.

Toward Realistic and Artifact-Free Insider-Threat Data,K. S. Killourhy; R. A. Maxion,"Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2007. ACSAC 2007. Twenty-Third Annual",20080102,2007,,,87,96,"Progress in insider-threat detection is currently limited by a lack of realistic, publicly available, real-world data. For reasons of privacy and confidentiality, no one wants to expose their sensitive data to the research community. Data can be sanitized to mitigate privacy and confidentiality concerns, but the mere act of sanitizing the data may introduce artifacts that compromise its utility for research purposes. If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy. We establish that two of the three sanitization strategies actually alter the results of the experiment. Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the third sanitization strategy addresses these concerns, indicating that realistic, artifact-free data sets can be created with appropriate tools and methods.",1063-9527;10639527,978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604,,10.1109/ACSAC.2007.31,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412979,,Application software;Assembly;Banking;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data privacy;Detectors;Laboratories;Postal services,data privacy;security of data,artifact-free data sets;artifact-free insider-threat data;data confidentiality;data privacy;data sanitization artifacts;insider-threat detection;sensitive data,,1,,13,,,10-14 Dec. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Eng., Syracuse Univ., NY, USA",19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium,20050418,2005,,,41a,41a,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors' locations play a critical role in many applications. Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.",1530-2075;15302075,0-7695-2312-9;0769523129,,10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861,,Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks,Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks,,11,,42,,,04-08 April 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it.

NRE: Suppress Selective Forwarding attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks,B. Cui; S. J. Yang,"Department of Computer Engineering, Rochester Institute of Technology, New York 14623-5603, USA","Communications and Network Security (CNS), 2014 IEEE Conference on",20141229,2014,,,229,237,"Selective Forwarding (SF) attacks impact the data transmission integrity by not forwarding a subset of received packets from time to time. The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.",,,,10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490,,Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks,,1,,21,,,29-31 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Detecting web application attacks with use of Gene Expression Programming,J. Skaruz; F.

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.",1089-778X;1089778X,978-1-4244-2958-5;9781424429585,978-1-4244-2959-2;9781424429592,10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190,,Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server,SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data,SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming,,2,,15,,,18-21 May 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

By casting the problem in a game-theoretic framework and by exploiting the parallelism between the attacker's goal and optimal transport theory, we introduce the concept of security margin defined as the maximum average per-sample distortion introduced by the attacker for which the two sources can be distinguished ensuring arbitrarily small, yet positive, error exponents for type I and type II error probabilities. Several versions of the problem are considered according to the available knowledge about the sources. We compute the security margin for some classes of sources and derive general bounds assuming that the distortion is measured in terms of the mean square error between the original and the attacked sequence.

Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System,Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; K. Salamatian,"Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC),20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.",1530-1346;15301346,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942,Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort,Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV,feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data,MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component,,0,,19,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Taha; K. kim,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science Technology and Research, Abu Dhabi, UAE",IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,20160715,2016,46,8,1796,1806,"Botnets, which consist of remotely controlled compromised machines called bots, provide a distributed platform for several threats against cyber world entities and enterprises. Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset.

Intrusion detection in real-time database systems via time signatures,V. C. S. Lee; J. A. Stankovic; S. H. Son,"Dept. of Comput.

Sixth IEEE",20020806,2000,,,124,133,"The authors describe a method for intrusion detection applied to real time database systems. The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

This paper presents NetViewer, a network measurement approach that can simultaneously detect, identify, and visualize attacks and anomalous traffic in real-time by passively monitoring packet headers. We propose to represent samples of network packet header data as frames or images. With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that scene change analysis can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies. We also show that motion prediction techniques can be employed to understand the patterns of some of the attacks.

Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

Understanding transactional memory performance,D. E. Porter; E.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system.

QTL: An efficient scheduling policy for 10Gbps network intrusion detection system,Bo Song; Weibing Yang; Mingyu Chen; Xiaofang Zhao; Jianping Fan,"Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2010 IEEE Symposium on",20100812,2010,,,190,195,"Broad network bandwidth and deep inspection impose great challenge for the capability of 10Gpbs network security monitoring. Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.",1530-1346;15301346,978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548,,10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727,LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate,Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors,Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data,Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring,,0,,21,,,22-25 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks.

For this purpose, under deep analyzing the association between attack intention and network configuration information, a network security situation evaluation method based on attack intention recognition was proposed. Unlike traditional method, the evaluation method was based on intruder. This method firstly made causal analysis of attack event and discovered intrusion path to recognize every attack stages, then realized situation evaluation based on the attack stages. Lastly the method recognized the attack intention of next stage to forecast network security situation based on achieved attack stages, combined with vulnerability and network connectivity.

The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments.

Intrusion detection using k-Nearest Neighbor,M. Govindarajan; R. Chandrasekaran,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Annamalai University, Annamalai Nagar, Tamil Nadu, India",2009 First International Conference on Advanced Computing,20100112,2009,,,13,20,"Data mining is the use of algorithms to extract the information and patterns derived by the knowledge discovery in databases process. Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

We have designed a multi-point defense and recovery system to defeat remote exploits. We used a checkpoint based approach to recover server applications under attack. It takes a snapshot of the application's context and memory state before it handles the next request. If the request turns out to be malicious, the system can discard the malicious request and rollback the application's state to a known good one through checkpointing.

Towards dynamic self-tuning for intrusion detection systems,S. i. Kim; N. Nwanze; J. Kintner,"Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, USA",International Performance Computing and Communications Conference,20110106,2010,,,17,24,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems pattern the normal activity and are attractive in that new, never-seen attacks can be detected. In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.",,978-1-4577-1034-6;9781457710346,,10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563,dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine,Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines,Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols,HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine,,5,,20,,,8-8 Sept. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations.

For this reason, intrusion detection has to be done in real-time before intruders can inflict damage, and previous detection systems do not satisfy this need for big data. Using Apache Storm, a Real time Hybrid Intrusion Detection System has been developed in our work. Apache Storm serves as a distributed, fault tolerant, real time big data stream processor.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

Detecting Malicious Javascript in PDF through Document Instrumentation,D. Liu; H. Wang; A. Stavrou,,2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks,20140922,2014,,,100,111,"An emerging threat vector, embedded malware inside popular document formats, has become rampant since 2008. Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks.

The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various. In the illustrative example, the number of attributes is reduced greatly and the detection is in a high precision for the attacks of DoS and Probe, a low false positive rate in all types of attacks.",,978-1-4244-5821-9;9781424458219,,10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497340,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497340,FCM;data mining;intrusion detection,Availability;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Probes,data mining;pattern clustering;security of data,DoS attack;FCM;Probe;data mining techniques;fuzzy c-means clustering;intrusion detection approach;optimal attribute set;reduction algorithm;redundant attribute set,,2,,18,,,21-24 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Improving cyber-security of smart grid systems via anomaly detection and linguistic domain knowledge,O. Linda; M. Manic; T. Vollmer,"University of Idaho, Idaho Falls, USA","Resilient Control Systems (ISRCS), 2012 5th International Symposium on",20120924,2012,,,48,54,"The planned large scale deployment of smart grid network devices will generate a large amount of information exchanged over various types of communication networks. The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack.

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

Network-based and Attack-resilient Length Signature Generation for Zero-day Polymorphic Worms,Z. Li; L. Wang; Y. Chen; Z. Fu,"Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA",2007 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols,20071105,2007,,,164,173,"It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at the edge network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent the worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.",1092-1648;10921648,978-1-4244-1587-8;9781424415878,978-1-4244-1588-5;9781424415885,10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847,,Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic,invasive software;telecommunication security,attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature,,13,,40,,,16-19 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
An improved Hidden Markov Model for anomaly detection using frequent common patterns,A. Sultana; A. Hamou-Lhadj; M. Couture,Software Behavioural Analysis Research Lab Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Concordia University,2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),20121129,2012,,,1113,1117,"Host-based intrusion detection techniques are needed to ensure the safety and security of software systems, especially, if these systems handle sensitive data. Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.",1550-3607;15503607,978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529,978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512,10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527,Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training,hidden Markov models;security of data,HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior,,3,,30,,,10-15 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign.

Sci. & Software Eng., Melbourne Univ., Melbourne, VIC","Network Operations and Management Symposium Workshops, 2008. NOMS Workshops 2008. IEEE",20080502,2008,,,321,327,"Millions of users divulge their personal information on phishing web sites, which causes over a billion dollars loss every year. Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism.

This paper includes an overview of several IDS implementations. Many approaches based on hidden Markov models and various forms of finite state automata have been proposed to solve problem of detecting anomaly intrusion, a security attack in which an intruder assumes the identity of a legitimate user. It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units.

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates.

Behavior-based intrusion detection in encrypted environments,R. Koch; M. Golling; G. D. Rodosek,"Univ. der Bundeswehr Munchen, Neubiberg, Germany",IEEE Communications Magazine,20140715,2014,52,7,124,131,"In recent years the Internet has evolved into a critical communication infrastructure that is omnipresent in almost all aspects of our daily life. This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.",0163-6804;01636804,,,10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852093,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852093,,Encryption;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Payloads;Telecommunication network management,Internet;computer network security;cryptography,Internet;behavior-based intrusion detection;data exfiltration;encrypted communication;encrypted environments;malicious activity detection,,0,,13,,,14-Jul,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

Inst., Univ. of Bradford, Bradford, UK",2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications,20100601,2010,,,753,759,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are considered as essential mechanisms to ensure reliable security. Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved cause and effect model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph.

BrowserGuard: A Behavior-Based Solution to Drive-by-Download Attacks,F. H. Hsu; C. K. Tso; Y. C. Yeh; W. J. Wang; L. H. Chen,National Central University,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,20110728,2011,29,7,1461,1468,"Along with an increasing user population of various web applications, browser-based drive-by-download attacks soon become one of the most common security threats to the cyber community. A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.",0733-8716;07338716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164,Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security,Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages,Web sites;security of data,BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site,,7,,36,,,11-Aug,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal can be integrated in classification tasks.

Multigrade security monitoring for ad-hoc wireless networks,M. T. Creti; M. Beaman; S. Bagchi; Zhiyuan Li; Yung-Hsiang Lu,,2009 IEEE 6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems,20091117,2009,,,342,352,"Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.",2155-6806;21556806,978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135,,10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981,,Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks,ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels,MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols,,0,,19,,,12-15 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS.

Most previous work studies these two classes of issues separately. In this paper, we propose a framework of combining intrusion detection and continuous authentication in MANETs. In this framework, multimodal biometrics are used for continuous authentication, and intrusion detection is modeled as sensors to detect system security state. We formulate the whole system as a partially observed Markov decision process considering both system security requirements and resource constraints. We then use dynamic programming-based hidden Markov model scheduling algorithms to derive the optimal schemes for both intrusion detection and continuous authentication.

Database Isolation and Filtering against Data Corruption Attacks,M. Yu; W. Zang; P. Liu,"Western Illinois Univ., Macomb","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2007. ACSAC 2007. Twenty-Third Annual",20080102,2007,,,97,106,"Various attacks (e.g., SQL injections) may corrupt data items in the database systems, which decreases the integrity level of the database. Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a unsafe zone to isolate user's SQL queries from a safe zone of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases.

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks. Our method uses Random Forests to build classifiers based on which the incoming slow-read traffic can be detected at the destination.

The challenge is that one cannot predict the attack mechanism that will cause the modified behavior or when and how the target's behavior will diverge. Thus, if one restricts one's sensors to a particular aspect of the system or looks for specific malicious behavior, one is likely to miss the attack. This paper describes an approach for simultaneously examining multiple network and host abstraction layers to discover anomalous behavior and then correlating anomalies to determine whether an attack is taking place and, when applicable, select an automatic response.

We minimize the communication overhead by clustering the sensor measurements and merging clusters before sending a description of the clusters to the other nodes. In order to evaluate our distributed scheme, we implemented our algorithm in a simulation based on the sensor data gathered from the Great Duck Island project. We demonstrate that our scheme achieves comparable accuracy compared to a centralized scheme with a significant reduction in communication overhead",,1-4244-0410-X;142440410X,1-4244-0411-8;1424404118,10.1109/ICCS.2006.301508,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085803,,Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Energy consumption;Fault diagnosis;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Software engineering;Wireless sensor networks,fault diagnosis;wireless sensor networks,Great Duck Island project;clustering;data gathering;distributed anomaly detection algorithm;fault diagnosis;intrusion detection;wireless sensor network,,43,,14,,,Oct. 2006,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
Network traffic behavior analysis by decomposition into control and data planes,Basil AsSadhan; Hyong Kim; J. M. F.

IEEE International Symposium on",20080603,2008,,,1,8,"In this paper, we analyze network traffic behavior by decomposing header traffic into control and data planes to study the relationship between the two planes. By computing the cross-correlation between the control and data traffics, we observe a general 'similar' behavior between the two planes during normal behavior, and that this similarity is affected during abnormal behaviors. This allows us to focus on abnormal changes in network traffic behavior. We test our approach on the Network Intrusion Dataset provided by the Information Exploration Shootout (IES) project and the 1999 DARPA Intrusion detection Evaluation Dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab. We find that TCP control and data traffic have high correlation levels during benign normal applications.

IDS Alert Correlation in the Wild With EDGe,E. Raftopoulos; X. Dimitropoulos,"ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,20141127,2014,32,10,1933,1946,"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) produce a large number of alerts, which overwhelm their operators, e.g., a deployment of the popular Snort IDS in the campus network of ETH Zurich (which includes more than 40 thousand hosts) produces on average 3 million alerts per day. In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.",0733-8716;07338716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257,Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort,Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses,invasive software,EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware,,0,,36,,9/17/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazine

We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against attackers with varying degrees of sophistication.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces noise due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process.

Early statistical anomaly intrusion detection of DOS attacks using MIB traffic parameters,Jun Li; C. Manikopoulos,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society",20030923,2003,,,53,59,"We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a <sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background.

Detecting Spam Zombies by Monitoring Outgoing Messages,Z. Duan; P. Chen; F. Sanchez; Y. Dong; M. Stephenson; J. Barker,"Florida State Univ., Tallahassee, FL","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE",20090602,2009,,,1764,1772,"Compromised machines are one of the key security threats on the Internet; they are often used to launch various security attacks such as DDoS, spamming, and identity theft. In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.",0743-166X;0743166X,978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128,978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135,10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062096,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062096,,Aggregates;Condition monitoring;Error analysis;Internet;Power generation economics;Probability;Recruitment;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis;Unsolicited electronic mail,IP networks;Internet;electronic messaging;probability;security of data;statistical testing;unsolicited e-mail,DDoS;IP addresses;Internet;SPOT;U.S. campus network;compromised machines;identity theft;outgoing messages monitoring;security attacks;security threats;sequential probability ratio test;spam zombie detection system;spam zombies detection;spamming activity;statistical tool,,0,3,13,,,19-25 April 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper contributes with the proposal of an on-the-fly statistical technique that can detect and distinguish faulty data from malicious data in a distributed sensor network. Detecting faults and attacks is essential to ensure the correct semantic of the network, while distinguishing faults from attacks is necessary to initiate a correct recovery action. The approach uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the error/attack-free dynamics of the environment and the dynamics of error/attack data.

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored.

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.",,978-1-4799-0078-7;9781479900787,,10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175,Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling,Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors,Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing,IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources,,0,,20,,,26-28 Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept.

This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic.

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters.

In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.",,978-1-4799-3078-4;9781479930784,,10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318,Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security,computer network security,OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks,,1,,17,,,24-27 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a uncompromised router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology.

In this paper, an efficient intrusion detection model is introduced. The model uses intelligent techniques to detect intrusions. Two different architectures are introduced. The first architecture represents the level of sensor node, sink node, and base station. The second architecture represents the levels of sensor and sink nodes. This work proposes two intrusion detection algorithms, one uses a supervised learning mechanism to be used on the level of the sensor node and the other uses an unsupervised learning mechanism to be used on the levels of both the sink node and base station. The output of the algorithms is a set of detection rules which are structured in the form of binary tree. The introduced algorithms provided a high detection accuracy using less number of selected features, compared to previous work for intrusion detection, which decreases the complexity and the processing time.

CSE '09. International Conference on",20091009,2009,2,,817,822,"Trusted and reliable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) rely on the accurate and rapid detection of anomalies. However, the security model in wired networks is not suited for WSNs because of their energy constraints. In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system.

We first identify worm characteristics through their behavior, and then classify worm detection algorithms based on the parameters used in the algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

Flexible Intrusion Detection Systems for Memory-Constrained Embedded Systems,F. M. Tabrizi; K. Pattabiraman,"Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.",,,,10.1109/EDCC.2015.17,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950,IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring,Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters,embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management,SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem,,,,47,,,7-11 Sept. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets since neither source nodes nor destination nodes have the knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a malicious nodes detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, Merkle tree hashing technique. In our defense techniques we have two stages. The first stage is to detect the attack, and the second stage is to find the malicious nodes.

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior.

Making DPI Engines Resilient to Algorithmic Complexity Attacks,Y. Afek; A. Bremler-Barr; Y. Harchol; D. Hay; Y. Koral,"Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,,2016,PP,99,1,1,"This paper starts by demonstrating the vulnerability of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) mechanisms, which are at the core of security devices, to algorithmic complexity denial of service attacks, thus exposing a weakness in the first line of defense of enterprise networks and clouds. A system and a multi-core architecture to defend from these algorithmic complexity attacks is presented in the second part of the paper. The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack). Still, under normal traffic its running-time is worse than classical AC implementations. To overcome this problem, we introduce <formula formulatype=inline> <img src=/images/tex/35781.gif alt={\rm MCA}^{2}> </formula>Multi-Core Architecture to Mitigate Complexity Attacks, which dynamically combines the classical AC algorithm with our compressed implementation, to provide a robust solution to mitigate this cache-miss attack.

RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now.

An Approach of Discovering Causal Knowledge for Alert Correlating Based on Data Mining,F. Xuewei; W. Dongxia; H. Minhuan; S. Xiaoxia,"Beijing Inst. of Syst.

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers.

Our results show that the proposed model has achieved higher accuracies and detection rates of classification, where detection known worms are at least 98.30%, with classification error rate 1.70%, while the unknown worm detection rate is about 97.99%, with classification error rate 2.01%.",,978-1-4799-0137-1;9781479901371,,10.1109/PICICT.2013.20,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545938,Artificial Neural Network;Behavior-Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Decision Tree;Multi Classification;Nave Bayes;Worms,Accuracy;Adaptation models;Artificial neural networks;Grippers;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training,data mining;invasive software;pattern classification,WDMAC model;adaptive worm detection model;behavior-anomaly detection approach;classification error rate;computer system;data mining techniques;malware threats;multiclassifiers;perilous systems;unknown worm detection rate,,1,,14,,,15-16 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

The experiment results on the standard testing dataset validate the effectiveness of the FILMID based intrusion detection model.",2160-133X;2160133X,978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723,978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730,10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370708,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370708,Inductive reasoning;Intrusion detection model;Machine learning;Network security,High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control,learning by example;security of data;telecommunication security,fast inductive learning;high-speed network;intrusion detection model;machine learning,,2,,8,,,19-22 Aug. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
An efficient network intrusion detection method based on information theory and genetic algorithm,T. Xia; G. Qu; S. Hariri; M. Yousif,"Internet Technol. Lab., Arizona Univ., Tucson, AZ, USA","PCCC 2005. 24th IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference, 2005.",20050705,2005,,,11,17,"The Internet has been growing at an amazing rate and concurrent with the growth, the vulnerability of the Internet is also increasing. Though the Internet has been designed to withstand various forms of failure, the intrusion tools and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, exposing the Internet to new threats. To make networked systems reliable and robust it becomes highly essential to develop on-line monitoring, analysis and quantification of the behavior of networks under a wide range of attacks and to recover from these attacks. In this paper, we present a hybrid method based on information theory and genetic algorithm to detect network attacks. Our approach uses information theory to filter the traffic data and thus reduce the complexity. We use a linear structure rule to classify the network behaviors into normal and abnormal behaviors. We apply our approach to the kdd99 benchmark dataset and obtain high detection rate of 99.25% as well as low false alarm rate of 1.66%.",1097-2641;10972641,0-7803-8991-3;0780389913,,10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460505,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1460505,,Condition monitoring;Filtering theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic communication;Information filtering;Information filters;Information theory;Internet;Intrusion detection;Robustness,Internet;authorisation;benchmark testing;computer network reliability;filtering theory;genetic algorithms;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,Internet;filtering;genetic algorithm;information theory;intrusion detection method;kdd99 benchmark dataset;network attack detection;on-line monitoring;system reliability;traffic data;vulnerability,,5,,19,,,7-9 April 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publication
