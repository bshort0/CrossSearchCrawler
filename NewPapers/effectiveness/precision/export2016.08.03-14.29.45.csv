But it is difficult because of the differences of ability of each engineer. To solve this problem, we grouped failure modes in existing FMEA results by type.

We present experiments on three weeks of syslogs from Sandia's 512-node Spirit Linux cluster, showing one algorithm that localizes 50% of faults with 75% precision, corresponding to an excellent false positive rate of 0.05%.

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate.

Generally, access control mechanisms deal with allow or deny a based rule (for access to a file) which even extends to role based access control in some cases. This directly implies that access protection mechanism is generally tightly coupled with almost all operating systems. Still, intrusion is a common phenomenon.

"Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules","Z. A. Othman; E. E. Eljadi","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822;21556822","978-1-4577-0753-7;9781457707537","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","2","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to design and develop reliable and secure network services, rapid detection and quick response to these attacks are major concern. In practice, there is no scheme that completely detects or prevents the DDoS attack. Predicting number of zombies in a DDoS attack is helpful to suppress the effect of DDoS attack by filtering and rate limiting the most suspicious attack sources or improve DDoS response system. In this paper, we present machine learning approach based on support vector machine for regression to predict the number of zombies in a DDoS attack. MATLAB implementation of support vector machine for regression and datasets generated using NS-2 network simulators running on Linux platform are used for training and testing. SVM for regression with various kernel function and other parameters are compared for their prediction performance using mean square error (MSE).

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706;10636706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","6","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer.

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector. Our experience suggests that static analysis is a viable option for automated integrity property derivation, and it can have very low false positive rate (1 out of 141,280 in our Linux kernel case study) and very low false negative rate (about 0.013%).","","978-1-4673-0683-6;9781467306836","978-1-936968-32-9;9781936968329","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144814","integrity modeling;invariants detection;static analysis;tools","Analytical models;Hardware;Software","Linux;operating system kernels;program assemblers;program diagnostics;source coding","Linux kernel 2.4.32;array sensitivity;assembly code handling;automated integrity property derivation;commodity operating systems kernel;dynamic invariant detector;false alarms;field sensitivity;integrity models;pointer analysis;program runtime behavior modeling;runtime attestation;runtime integrity;static analysis-based global invariant detection tool;static source code analysis","","0","","34","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The collected system calls are treated as signals which are used to reconstruct the system's phase space. Then, by using the well-established techniques from dynamical system theory, we quantify the amount of complexity of the system's (program's) behavior.

Machine learning is an efficient approach to prevent the intrusion and classify the network attacks. This study highlights the combined power of filter approaches in intrusion detection framework. Feature selection technique removes the redundant features and builds a time consuming better-performed intrusion detector framework. This study presents a cross-breed type feature selection approach using duo filter schemes for intrusion detection. In this framework feature selection technique eliminate the irrelevant features to reduce the time complexity and build a better model to predict the result with a greater accuracy and Bayesian network based classification model has been built up to predict the types of attacks. The experiment shows that the proposed framework exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy which is 97.2746% and keeps the false positive rate at a lower rate of 0.008. The model shows better performance in terms of accuracy than other leading state-of-the-arts frameworks like Boosted DT, Hidden NB, KNN and Markov chain.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920  1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

To do that, we propose two different aggregation strategies: fixed prefix and variable prefix. The motivation for doing that is to reduce the number of entries in the bad neighborhood list, thus reducing memory storage requirements for intrusion detection solutions.

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction.

Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies.

When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification.

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations.

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8;0769521088","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Use of the new format is demonstrated in a method to create new datasets that retain more information than a simple network capture.

When a cyber security incident occurs, the critical question that security administrators are concerned about is: What has happened? Cyber situation assessment is critical to making correct and timely defense decisions by the analysts. STIX ontology, which was developed by taking advantage of existing cyber security related standards, is used to represent cyber threat information and infer important features of the cyber situation that help decision makers form their situational awareness. However, due to the widespread application of information technology, security analysts face a challenge in information overload. There are still huge volumes of low level observations captured by various sensors and network tools that need to be used to derive the high level intelligence queries such as potential courses of action and future impact. Therefore, identification of the relevant cyber threat information for a specific query is a crucial procedure for cyber situation assessment. In this paper, we leverage the STIX ontology to represent cyber threat information in a logical framework. In order to recognize specific situation types and identify the minimal and sufficient information for answering a query automatically, we propose an information relevance reasoning mechanism based on situation theory.

Unfortunately, these methods don't achieve a high performance of learning.

Second, a general behavior perception model is proposed for the unified framework based on hidden Markov random field. Spatial Markovianity is introduced to model the spatial context of distributed network behavior and stochastic interaction among interconnected nodes.

However, they do not directly detect intrusion, but they only monitor the attack symptoms. Therefore, no assumption can be made on the outcome of the attack, no assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML.

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-3-8007-3092-6;9783800730926","978-3-00-024883-2;9783000248832","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","2","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed technique depends much on the series of data corresponding to particular feature. The proposed method can accurately classify and differentiate normal (NORM) and abnormal heartbeats. Abnormal heartbeats include left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), ventricular premature contractions (VPC) and atrial premature contractions (APC).

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3;9781424460373","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","24","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the early stages of deployment, the intrusion and security problems have not been seriously considered, although they could have a negative impact on VoIP deployment. In the paper, SIP intrusion detection and prevention requirements are analyzed and an IDS/IPS architecture is proposed. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5;1424401445","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","18","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4244-2958-5;9781424429585","978-1-4244-2959-2;9781424429592","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server","SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data","SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming","","2","","15","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these classifiers work offline, since full-flow statistics are not available until a flow is finished. Therefore, it is usually too late to take actions for online deployment. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0;9780769533360","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Suricata includes multi-threading to improve processing speed beyond Snort. Previous work comparing the two products has not used a real-world setting. We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its  backbone in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed. Our methodology should be useful for comparing other intrusion-detection products.","","978-1-4673-0867-0;9781467308670","","10.1109/WAINA.2012.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185110","Snort;Suricata;computer networks;intrusion detection;performance","Accuracy;Engines;Instruction sets;Operating systems;Random access memory;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;multi-threading;public domain software;storage management;telecommunication traffic","Snort system;Suricata intrusion-detection system;computer-network monitoring;detection engines;malicious packets;memory requirements;multithreading;open-source improvement;red-teaming product;snort intrusion-detection systems;speed requirements","","4","","11","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent advances in Ethernet-based technology have taken this industry from shared 10 Mbps LAN segments to switched 100 Mbps LANs followed by 1 Gbps backbones for metropolitan area networks (MANs) and more recently 10 Gbps Ethernet technology for use in wide-area networks (WANs). Up until now, intersubstation communications typically have been provided by a SONET/SDH communication infrastructure. Although well understood and widely deployed, this legacy approach is not optimized for data traffic and requires protocol mapping and/or translation at both ends of the interface. The more recent trend of migrating towards voice over IP services combined with the advent of low-cost gigabit Ethernet switches and low-cost long-haul fiber optics has made it possible to deploy native Ethernet networks in wide-area applications. This paper looks at the new capabilities in substation automation, protection, and control made possible by native intersubstation Ethernet. Analysis is made of the current capabilities of this technology and state of the art tools available for Ethernet network management. The paper also examines application examples such as: Ethernet-based POTT protection schemes and synchrophasor data collection infrastructure.

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security.","","978-1-4577-0855-8;9781457708558","","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990290","","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Transportation","particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines;transportation","KDD dataset;improved SVM model;intrusion detection;kernel principal component analysis;particle swarm optimization;support vector machine;transportation information security systems","","3","","8","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In dealing with class imbalance in this paper Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to the training dataset. A feature selection method based on Information Gain is presented and used to construct a reduced feature subset of NSL-KDD dataset.

The outcomes of the game are quantified by specifying players' preferences and by assigning numbers to reflect these preferences. Examining players' best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the NE notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players' bounded rationality. The QRE results are more realistic and show that the solution of the game might be significantly different than the corresponding NE solution.

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","3","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A graphical user interface (GUI) with enhanced usability is also proposed. Previous MCMC and HMM-based methods are known to suffer performance impairments, degraded tracking and recognition accuracy, and higher computation costs when challenged with appearance and trajectory changes such as occlusion, interaction, and varying numbers of moving objects. This paper proposes a cost reduction method for the MCMC approach by taking moves, i.e., birth and death, out of the iteration loop of the Markov chain when different moving objects interact. For stable and robust tracking, an ellipse model with stochastic model parameters is used.

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate).

We derive simulated distributions of the posterior probability of exploit given the observation of a series of alerts and bounds on the posterior uncertainty given a particular distribution of the model parameters. Knowledge of such bounds introduces the novel prospect of a confidence versus agility tradeoff in IDS administration.

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done.

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604","Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator","Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","2","","31","","2014-12-18","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on the angle detection accuracy of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme, which is one of primary factors for rapid establishment of FSO links. The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data. The simulation results indicate that this new method can provide high-precision positioning of the laser beams, and the maximum angle detection error of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme can be less than 0.054 (0.94 mrad).","0733-8724;07338724","","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2360313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915668","Fisheye lens calibration;fisheye lens calibration;free space optical link;high-accuracy angle detection;spot location;ultra-wide field-of-view acquisition;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition","Accuracy;Imaging;Interpolation;Laser beams;Lenses;Measurement by laser beam;Optical fiber communication","calibration;laser beams;lenses;optical communication equipment;optical images;optical links;optical projectors;photodetectors","Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter;centroid locating algorithm;fisheye lens calibration algorithm;fisheye lens projection model;free-space optical links;high-accuracy angle detection;high-precision laser beam positioning;incident angle;incident beam imaging spot;integrated optics;natural neighbor interpolation algorithm;ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition scheme","","1","","21","","2014-10-02","Dec.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","2158-6985;21586985","978-1-4244-6356-5;9781424463565","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","4","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we develop a new method of model enforcement based on the JVM tool interface (JVMTI), which introduces few changes to JVM.

For instance, system events tracking lacks completeness of intrusion propagation, while dynamic taint tracking is not feasible to be deployed due to significant runtime overhead. Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the has-been-infected execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

In this work color images of melanoma are imparted to classify them among malignant and benign classes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized by Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO). As a part of the preprocessing step, an illumination compensation based segmentation algorithm is deployed. The segmentation process is followed by the proposed iterative dilation method to remove noise from a lesion. Some prominent features calculated from the segmented image based on asymmetric lesion-behavior, border irregularity, color variations and spanned diameter. Finally, these feature vector applied as an input to SVM classifier, which is used to distinguish malignant from benign samples of skin lesions.

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

NextGen will greatly increase the NAS capacity, efficiency, safety, flexibility, and environmental protection. Aviation Security is one of the core components in NextGen. Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking. IAS uses a multi-layered, cross-component, and multi-planed (data plane and control plane) structure.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.","0738-100X;0738100X","978-1-4244-6677-1;9781424466771","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522352","I/O access control;Virtual machine;smart phone security;virtual machine monitor","Access control;Batteries;Degradation;Equations;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Secure storage;Security;Smart phones","","","","0","","23","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","2","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The anonymity network Tor is often misused by hackers and criminals in order to remotely control hacked computers. In this paper we present our methodology for detecting any connection to or from Tor network. Our detection method is based on a list of Tor servers. We process the network traffic and match the source and destination IP addresses for each connection with Tor servers list. The list of Tor servers is automatically updated each day and the detection is in the real time. We applied our methodology on campus live traffic and showed that it can automatically detect Tor connections in the real time.

Every professional knows that the only way to secure completely a private network is to make it unreachable. However, even if this solution was undertaken for many years, nowadays it is not possible to close private network especially for business purpose. Thus security management becomes an important issue that must be considered carefully. This research concentrates on one particular aspect: where the networks becomes more complex (number of machines, number of users, number of connections....), making them more vulnerable to various kinds of complex security attacks. Therefore the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) require more advanced models to deal with these requirements. Multi-agent system (MAS) is suggested to provide powerful for the modeling and development of complex systems for detecting attacks. This can be done by depending on decomposition of the system into several interacting and autonomous entities called agents.

We construct a process expression for each function to describe its behaviour. Without constructing automata or introducing nondeterminacy, we use algebraic properties and algorithms to obtain a global process expression by combining the process expressions derived from each function.

In Deauth-DoS attack an attacker sends a large number of spoofed de-authentication frames to the client (s) resulting in their disconnection. Existing solutions to mitigate Deauth-DoS attack rely on encryption, protocol modifications, 802.11 standard up gradation, software and hardware upgrades which are costly. In this paper we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the Deauth-DoS attack in Wi-Fi network which does not suffer from these drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge ML based techniques have never been used for detection of Deauth-DoS attack. We have used a variety of ML based classifiers for detection of Deauth-DoS attack enabling an administrator to choose among a host of classification algorithms.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is intended for hardware implementation and could be included in the network interface, switch or firewall. Efficient implementation in software on a network host is also possible. Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. Results of a preliminary study are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437798","","Computer networks;Counting circuits;Filters;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;security of data;telecommunication security","anomaly detection system;anomaly packet identification;bit-pattern hash function;firewall;high-bandwidth network;machine learning;network interface;network intrusion detection;network traffic","","4","","26","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes.

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5;0769524575","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data.

Email: toelle@fgan.de","MILCOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE Military Communications conference","20070212","2006","","","1","7","This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow","2155-7578;21557578","1-4244-0617-X;142440617X","1-4244-0618-8;1424406188","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733","","Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology","Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security","IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities","","1","2","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857;10609857","978-1-4577-1349-1;9781457713491","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of between-class imbalance is a challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry, because of its critical influence on the performance of learning systems. Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters. Experimental results with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, on well known Intrusion Detection data set, support the usefulness of our approach.","","978-1-4673-2678-0;9781467326780","","10.1109/INTECH.2012.6457778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457778","Classification;Clustering;Imbalanced data;Intrusion Detection System;Nearest Opposing Pairs;Sample Selection","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Sampling methods;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;security of data","MLP;SS;classifier performance;imbalanced data distribution;intrusion detection based sample selection;learning systems;multilayer perceptron architecture","","0","","25","","","18-20 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","1","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented. NS-3 simulation platform has been used to carry out performance analysis of these hierarchical routing protocols.

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is near continuous wave (CW) performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3;0780385063","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present Fates, an anomaly-based NIDS designed to alleviate the two challenges. Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network.

Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify subsets of samples and subsets of features that jointly specify anomalous clusters. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect botnet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.","1551-2541;15512541","","","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324326","Bonferroni approximation;Gaussian Mixture Model;botnet;dependence tree;group anomaly detection;network intrusion detection;p-value","Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Joints;Peer-to-peer computing","invasive software;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","GAD scheme;anomalies clusters detection;anomalous clusters;anomalous data samples;botnet detection;data batch;feature dependency structure;group anomaly detection problem;low-dimensional feature subsets;low-dimensional subset;network intrusion detection;peer-to-peer flow clusters;real world network traffic flow data;statistical dependencies;test independence","","","","14","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs.

Data mining is to identify valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in massive data. It is demanding to apply data mining techniques to detect various intrusions. This paper presents an approach to detect intrusion based on data mining frame work. In the framework, intrusion detection is thought of as clustering. The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various. In the illustrative example, the number of attributes is reduced greatly and the detection is in a high precision for the attacks of DoS and Probe, a low false positive rate in all types of attacks.","","978-1-4244-5821-9;9781424458219","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497340","FCM;data mining;intrusion detection","Availability;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Probes","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","DoS attack;FCM;Probe;data mining techniques;fuzzy c-means clustering;intrusion detection approach;optimal attribute set;reduction algorithm;redundant attribute set","","2","","18","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through the usage of such methods the attackers are able to evade existing security systems and prevent a comprehensive detection of the malicious activities. Therefore, it is often necessary to perform a manual investigation of complex attacks, to identify all steps and malicious activities that belong to an attack. One main objective of an investigation is to correlate existing events and reveal relations between different activities, to get a comprehensive overview of the attack. Due to the fact that the correlation is often done manually, this process is complex and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a new automated correlation approach that uses the tainting concept to identify related log events. The approach uses meaningful attributes as taint sources and a taint policy to propagate the taint to related events. For the identification of the correlations, it is also possible to use meta-information sources to support the correlation process. Furthermore, the tainting based approach allows to visualize the correlation results in a taint graph, which simplifies the traceability. We successfully evaluated the proposed approach with log events from a simulated attack where real world attack methods and tools were used. With the new approach it was possible to identify all events that recorded the malicious activities of the attacker and the created taint graph allowed a comprehensive retracing of the attack. Thus, the correlation approach can support investigations in an effective way, because it reduces the complexity of event correlation and the needed time.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502851","Attack Tracing;Event Attribute Tainting;Event Correlation;Event Tainting","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Correlation;IP networks;Manuals;Security","telecommunication security","analyzed attacks;attack tracing;event correlation;malicious activities;revealed attacks;security systems;taint graph","","","","13","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157;07303157","978-0-7695-3726-9;9780769537269","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","1","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

In this paper, we propose a new expert system, being able to automatically detect the origin of attack in single and multi-stage attacks, with no human involved in the investigations. The main nobility of our forensics system is the development of an expert system based on fuzzy logic, which uses multiple sources to detect the origin of attack and systems involved in it, and then automatically creates evidences. This system is able to indicate the time, origin and scenario of the attack. Experimental results show that our system can detect the origin of attack in single and multi-step attacks and provide useful and comprehensive information for future investigation.","","","","10.1109/ICCKE.2015.7365863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365863","buffer overflow;intrusion detection;network forensics;security","Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Reliability","computer network security;digital forensics;expert systems;fuzzy logic","buffer overflow attack;complex multistage intrusions;digital evidence analysis;digital evidence collection;digital evidence correlation;digital evidence detection;digital evidence document;digital evidence examination;digital evidence identification;expert system;fuzzy logic;multistage attacks;network attack origin forensics;single attacks","","","","21","","","29-29 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1;9781424475261","978-0-7695-4107-5;9780769541075","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

This algorithm clusters large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical values effectively. The intrusion detection system based on this algorithm can deal with massive unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and anomaly and even can detect unknown attacks.

How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation.

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","978-0-7695-3185-4;9780769531854","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network.

This includes better automated extraction of rules parameters as well as bootstrap aggregation for generalization. Experimental results show that such optimization gives a smaller number of rules, while the accuracy increases in comparison to existing approaches. In particular, it showed an accuracy of 98% when using only 39 rules. In our research we contribute to forensics science by increasing awareness and bringing more comprehensive fuzzy rules.

As a result, anomaly or learning based intrusion detection mechanisms have been developed to cope with such attacks. Among variety of anomaly detection approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are known to be two of the best machine learning algorithms to classify normal from abnormal behaviors. In this paper a hybrid anomaly-based intrusion detection method is proposed that is based on these two methods. These methods are trained in supervised way. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of proposed approach: First, a feature selection technique using the entropy of features is used for extracting optimized information from KDD data set and second, a novel method is proposed to combine the results of these two learning based methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid approach by using the KDD dataset. The simulation results show that which features of KDD are better to distinguish the normal from abnormal traffics. Also these results show the detection precision of the DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L attacks by using our method are 99%, 100%, 100% and 100% respectively.","","978-1-4673-2072-6;9781467320726","","10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483122","Anomaly detection;Intrusion detection;MLP;SVM;feature selection","Entropy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Mathematical model;Support vector machines;Training","multilayer perceptrons;security of data;support vector machines","DoS attack;KDD data set;MLP;R2L attack;SVM;U2R attack;entropy;feature selection technique;hybrid anomaly based intrusion detection method;learning based intrusion detection mechanism;learning based method;machine learning algorithm;multilayer perceptron;probe attack;support vector machine","","0","","11","","","6-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Common challenges for IDS are large amount of data to process, low detection rate and high rate of false alarms. Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) based IDS with network traffic profiling is tested on Panjab University - Intrusion DataSet (PU-IDataSet). This IDS is known as alpha-FST-Beta IDS. The training connections are first categorized on the basis of protocol and service features. This categorization is named as alpha profiling. It increases the scalability and reduces the time complexity of IDS. Large feature set of network traffic dataset is reduced using ensemble of three feature selection techniques. Beta profiling is used to reduce the size of training dataset. Various parameters like accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate, false negative rate, precision, F1-score and detection time is used to evaluate the performance. The results obtained encourage the integration of this system in intrusion detection models.","","978-1-4673-8251-9;9781467382519","","10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453280","Feature Selection Technique;Intrusion Detection System;Network Traffic Profiling;Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine;PU-IDataSet;Sampling","Intrusion detection;Neurons;Protocols;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Time complexity;Training","computational complexity;feature selection;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F1-score;IDS time complexity;OS-ELM based IDS;PU-IDataSet;Panjab University - Intrusion DataSet;alpha profiling;alpha-FST-Beta IDS;behavioral profile;beta profiling;feature selection technique;intrusion detection system;malware detection;network activities;network traffic profiling;online sequential extreme learning machine;performance analysis;protocol;service features","","","","16","","","21-22 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

The observation is that network protocols often have short meaningful status codes saved at the beginning of server responses upon client requests. A successful intrusion that alters the behavior of a network application server often results in an unexpected server response, which does not contain the valid protocol status code. This can be used to verify the result of the intrusion attempt. We then extend this method to verify the result of attacks that still generate valid protocol status code in the server responses. We evaluate this approach by augmenting Snort signatures and testing on real world data.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees.

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels.

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware.

Although the identity and security of a node can be verified through various security mechanisms are not always suitable to improve the wireless network performance and fault node cannot be easily recover from the blasts. In this paper, I propose to use distributed detection algorithm to efficiently measure the performance of networks and handle those blasts in accurate and separate manner. In extension to distributed detection algorithm a three separate intrusion detection system is proposed to detect these types of blasts efficiently with good accuracy. Local monitoring algorithm is proposed to detect the multiple blasts. After detecting these blasts the blaster nodes are eliminated. The simulation result shows better performance of our proposed system. I evaluated our techniques through two test beds in two different networks.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.","","","","10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering","Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining","","0","","24","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) encompass one field of classification that has proven to yield high accuracy and has recently seen increased widespread use, however, the required computational intensity places a challenge on computer architects to design a hardware structure capable of performing real-time classifications while maintaining low power consumption. This paper proposes the first ever fully pipelined, floating point based, multi-use reconfigurable hardware architecture designed to act in conjunction with embedded processing as an accelerator for multiclass SVM classification. Several tasks, involving an extensive sample set of over 100,000 classifications, are evaluated for speed and accuracy against the same suite running on both an Intel Core i7-2600 system with lib SVM and an Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU.

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9;9781479964529","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","4","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","24","3","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks.

The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols.

Anomaly detection systems have success in exposing new attacks, commonly referred to as `zero' day attacks, yet have high false positive rates. False positive events occur when an activity is flagged for investigation yet it was determined to be benign upon analysis. Computational power and valuable resources are wasted when the irrelevant data is processed, data flagged, analyst alerted, and the irrelevant data is finally disregarded. In an effort to make intrusion detection systems more efficient the false positive rate must be reduced. This paper proposes a model for reducing false positives using data mining techniques by combining support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and Naive Bayes.","","","","10.1109/SECON.2016.7506774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506774","Data-Mining;Decision Trees;False Positives;Intrusion Detection System;Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machines","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Vegetation","Bayes methods;computer network security;data mining;decision trees;support vector machines","data-mining techniques;decision trees;false positives;host packets;intrusion detection systems;malicious activities;naive Bayes;network packets;off-line analysis;support vector machines","","","","","","","March 30 2016-April 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of enterprises are striving to reduce their computing cost through the means of virtualization. This demand of reducing the computing cost has led to the innovation of cloud computing. With the increasing number of companies resorting to employ resources in the cloud, the protection of the users' data is becoming a significant issue of concern. This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network. The data captured will undergo intense data mining through clustering and then performing classification using BOAT algorithm to detect the presence of intruders on the cloud. The mining approach will consider various attributes of the data to scrutinize the user behaviour.","","978-1-4799-6895-4;9781479968954","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014762","BOAT algorithm;Cloud computing;anomaly-detection;centralized resources;data mining;intrusion detection;security","Boats;Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Decision trees;Intrusion detection","cloud computing;cost reduction;data mining;security of data;virtualisation","BOAT algorithm;anomaly-based IDS implementation;cloud computing;cloud environment;computing cost;data mining;enterprises;intrusion detection;security threats;virtualization","","0","","32","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","evasive attack;intrusion detection;protocol mimicry;protocol structure;state transition","Inspection;Intrusion detection;MIMICs;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","security of data","IDS-IPS;MimicHunter framework;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;firewall;information theft events;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network based intrusion;network security audit;network security devices;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7;9781467326247","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed.

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend.

IEEE 34th Annual 2000 International Carnahan Conference on","20020806","2000","","","29","34","There is a new trend in the outdoor security market that demands more precision in identifying the crossing area of an intruder. Often called intrusion location capability, this capability also presents inherent features such as; more accuracy in camera pre-set positioning, temporary disabling of sub-zone and individual sensitivity level per sub-zone. However, even though the market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact on the overall system cost. The paper shows how synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length. In other word, for a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is subdivided in to up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters. Synergistic radar technology can be applied to buried, surface, wall and roof applications. This intrusion location capability also applies to each of these applications","","0-7803-5965-8;0780359658","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891162","","Cameras;Coaxial cables;Costs;Intrusion detection;Radar;Radio broadcasting;Radio frequency;Radio transmitters;Security;Space technology","access control;radar applications;radar signal processing","camera pre-set positioning accuracy;individual sensitivity level;intrusion location capability;outdoor security;synergistic radar technology;temporary sub-zone disabling","","2","","7","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers.

The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

Information about potentially privacy violating rules can subsequently be used to tune the IDS rule sets, with the objective to minimise the expected amount of data privacy violations during normal operation.

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the widely used intrusion detection techniques. However, many ANN-based methods are faced with unsatisfactory results and low detection precision. A new intrusion detection method by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is proposed. PNN divides inputs into two groups, normal and abnormal. Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time.

We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic).

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association.

By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early 1990s into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of deep packet inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2321898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814316","Flow export;IPFIX;Internet measurements;NetFlow;network monitoring","Data analysis;Electronic mail;High-speed networks;Internet;Telecommunication congestion control;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;data analysis;protocols;telecommunication traffic","IPFIX;Internet measurements;NetFlow;data analysis;data collection;data loss;deep packet inspection approach;flow analysis;flow data artifacts;flow monitoring;high-speed networks;packet capture;packet observation;packet-based traffic analysis;protocols;sound flow measurements;traffic monitoring","","18","","97","","2014-05-12","Fourthquarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The framework uses unsupervised learning at runtime, can perform fast anomaly detection on the fly, and can quickly adapt to system load fluctuations and user behavior shifts.

Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM. Based on several models with different measures, fuzzy logic makes the final decision of whether current behavior is abnormal or not.

In this paper we describe the UNISON middleware architecture, which seeks to provide such functionality in the form of loosely-coupled, distributed publish/subscribe messaging, distributed key-value data persistence, and basic local component control. Taken in isolation, the individual parts of UNISON encompass features already present in existing systems and infrastructures, however, UNISON combines these into a consistent whole, providing data storage/distribution and messaging/control in a simple, light-weight and unified fashion. We have prototyped UNISON as a self-standing middleware platform, and have used the resulting prototype to support a (similarly prototypical) generic, autonomous cyber defence system from DST Group's HINDER project. We discuss our experiences with UNISON in the context of this system.

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling.

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6;9781467364256","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2339-0;0769523390","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","8","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In determining the risk of taint propagation, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path for assisting a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and estimate the losses of associated taint sources.

Our approach verified the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine (FSM) to appropriately reflect the real situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment.

As a consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy consumed by the device. In this perspective, this paper aims to spot malware covertly exchanging data using two detection methods based on artificial intelligence tools, such as neural networks and decision trees.

Besides the increasing data rate, the advent of programmable networks necessitates efficient solutions for supporting packet processing tasks in an adaptive way. Introducing a modification of a protocol or any new protocol in such a flexible infrastructure implies a novel management approach incorporating network monitoring equipment with reconfigurable architecture. The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring. We present the architecture focusing on the system-level integration of specific packet processors. The integration of processing building blocks into one high performance system has great challenges. These are primarily related to specific, limiting factors of system resources - which we discuss also in this paper.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140417","100 Gbit/s Ethernet;Field Programmable Gate Array;network management;network monitoring;reconfigurable hardware;traffic analysis","Computer architecture;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Monitoring;Protocols;Synchronization","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;field programmable gate arrays;firmware;packet switching;parallel architectures;protocols;reconfigurable architectures","C-GEP;FPGA-based custom hardware platform;adaptive network management;field programmable gate array;firmware;high performance networking;multipurpose network;network monitoring equipment;packet processing;programmable networks;protocol;reconfigurable architecture;reconfigurable hardware;specific packet processor;system level integration","","1","","19","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, binary protocol reverse engineering has been a new challenge in recent years for approaches that traditionally have dealt with text-based protocols rather than binary protocols. In this study, the authors propose a novel approach called PRE-Bin that automatically extracts binary-type fields of binary protocols based on fine-grained bits. First, a silhouette coefficient is introduced into the hierarchical clustering to confirm the optimal clustering number of binary frames. Second, a modified multiple sequence alignment algorithm, in which the matching process and back-tracing rules are redesigned, is also proposed to analyse binary field features. Finally, a Bayes decision model is invoked to describe field features and determine bit-oriented field boundaries. The maximum a posteriori criterion is leveraged to complete an optimal protocol format estimation of binary field boundaries. The authors implemented a prototype system of PRE-Bin to infer the specification of binary protocols from actual traffic traces. Experimental results indicate that PRE-Bin effectively extracts binary fields and outperforms the existing algorithms.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452480","","","Bayes methods;reverse engineering","Bayes decision model;automatic binary protocol reverse engineering;back-tracing rules;binary field boundaries;binary field features;binary protocols;binary-type fields;bit-oriented field boundaries;bit-oriented format extraction approach;fine grained bits;optimal clustering number;optimal protocol format estimation;protocol message format extraction;silhouette coefficient;target protocol specifications;text-based protocols","","","","","","","4 14 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Examples of those parameters include, but are not limited to time stamp information, attack type, source and destination IP addresses, direction of alert and network application type. In this paper we propose a novel framework for mining alerts of NIDS output report log for automatically predicting the severity of attack revealed by those alerts using data mining classification techniques. Our framework automatically detects the attack severity using the type of the suspicious traffic detected by NIDS as a feature. Hence it can save the time spent to manually analyze the log file of NIDS in order to categorize various types of captured suspicious traffic in view of the detected severity of attack. Moreover, it can help the network security administrator to create policy rules that take immediate action against the detected network attack based on its predicted severity. The experimental results show that our approach can correctly predict the severity of attack for more than 99.2% of alerts samples included in log output report of the deployed NIDS.","","","","10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492742","data mining;log file alerts;network intrusion detection","Cleaning;Communication networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training","","","","","","29","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the contrary, BIOS of new computer systems (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices, and other embedded systems) can be easily upgraded using a flash or capsule mechanism which can add new vulnerabilities either through malicious code, or by accidental incidents, and deliberate attack. The recent attack on Iranian Nuclear Power Plant (Stuxnet) [1:2] is an example of advanced persistent attack. This attack vector adds a new dimension into the information security (IS) spectrum, which needs to be guarded by implementing a holistic approach employed at enterprise level. Malicious BIOS upgrades can also cause denial of service, stealing of information or addition of new backdoors which can be exploited by attackers for causing business loss, passive eaves dropping or total destruction of system without knowledge of user. To address this challenge a capability for verification of BIOS integrity needs to be developed and due diligence must be observed for proactive resolution of the issue.

Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one. This means that the presented implementation architecture is immune to algorithmic complexity attacks","","0-7695-2565-2;0769525652","","10.1109/DEPCOS-RELCOMEX.2006.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024042","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;Databases;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","cryptography;invasive software;string matching","IT security safeguards;Karp-Rabin algorithm;Snort IPS signatures;Witty worm;algorithmic complexity attacks;denial of service attacks;hash tables;network intrusion prevention system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;resource-efficient string matching algorithm;time-efficient string matching algorithm","","4","1","28","","","25-27 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-8178-1;9781424481781","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many established outlier detection methods are designed to search for low-density objects in a static data set of vectors in Euclidean space. For trend detection, high volume events are of interest and the data set is constantly changing. These two problems appear to be very different at first. However, they also have obvious similarities.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mathematical transformation algorithms have proven effective at interpreting multilingual, unstructured data, but high computational requirements of such algorithms prevent their widespread use. The rate of computation can be vastly increased with field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms. To understand the implications of these constraints and to benchmark the performance of the system, we have performed a series of experiments processing multilingual documents.

It is very important to find the structure from big data. In this paper, we focus on the neral network algorithm, Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Maps (GHSOM). GHSOM is considered that it can provide structured clustering. However, the hierarchical growing mechanism of GHSOM is faulty. This paper proposes a new enhanced GHSOM, called sGHSOM. sGHSOM solves the issue of the growing mechanism in GHSOM. We use the KDD Cup 1999 Data as the benchmark for estimating the performance of sGHSOM. The experiment results show that sGHSOM has a higher precision than GHSOM on classification. Furthermore, this paper uses actual measured DNS queries to show that sGHSOM can visualize the structure of DNS queries in time series exactly for detecting infected computers comparing with GHSOM.","","","","10.1049/cp.2015.0756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446888","Classification;DNS;GHSOM;KDD Cup;Structured Clustering;Time Series","","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data;self-organising feature maps;time series","DNS queries;GHSOM enhancement;KDD Cup 1999 Data;data mining technologies;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;intrusion detection;neural network algorithm;sGHSOM;structured clustering;time series","","","","","","","21-23 Sept. 2015","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Due to improve the performance of existing intrusion detection methods which are implemented in the kernel of operating system, this paper focuses on the negative selection algorithm using maximum entropy model to avoid the degeneration caused by the valueless repetition of system calls.

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We identify several principles for designing usable access control systems and introduce the usable mandatory integrity protection (UMIP) model that adds usable mandatory access control to operating systems. The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in the face of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection. We also discuss our implementation of the UMIP model for Linux using the Linux Security Modules framework, and show that it is simple to configure, has low overhead, and effectively defends against a number of network-based attacks.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2848-1;0769528481","","10.1109/SP.2007.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223222","","Access control;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Permission;Power system security;Protection;Usability","Linux;authorisation;systems analysis","Linux security module framework;mandatory usable access control system;network-based attack;operating system;usable mandatory integrity protection","","10","","24","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4;9781467300254","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8;9781457717048","978-1-4577-1702-4;9781457717024","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","15","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within this framework, it becomes possible to quantify, e.g., the robustness of a user's proof of authorization to possible perturbations in the system, how close an unauthorized user is to satisfying a particular policy, and relative top-k style rankings of the best users to carry out a particular task. To this end, we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions for assessing the robustness of authorization decisions, and develop criteria under which these types of functions can be composed with one another.

Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic.

In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture.

The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done.

"Effect of personality traits on trust and risk to phishing vulnerability: Modeling and analysis","Jin-Hee Cho; Hasan Cam; A.

One of the popular social engineering attacks is a phishing attack, exploiting humans' vulnerability in order to obtain individuals' private or credential information. Recent studies have found that the so called `phishing susceptibility' (i.e., the likelihood of being phished) is closely correlated with the individuals' personality traits. In particular, the relations between phishing susceptibility and Big Five personality traits have been analyzed via empirical studies in diverse domains. However, little prior work has proposed a mathematical model investigating the effect of an individual's personality traits on perceived trust or risk and decision performance. This work proposes a probability model using Stochastic Petri Nets in order to examine the effect of an individual human's personality traits on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance. Our results show that agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effect on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance particularly when openness and conscientiousness is very low. The developed mathematical model can be applied to predict what personality profiles in an organization are more exposed to social engineering, suggesting customized security training scenarios.","","","","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497779","perceived risk;perceived trust;personality traits;phishing susceptibility","Analytical models;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Petri nets;Resilience;Security;Uncertainty","Petri nets;computer crime;trusted computing","Big Five personality traits;customized security training scenarios;cyberspace;decision performance;human personality traits;mathematical model;modeling;neuroticism;perceived trust;phishing attack;phishing susceptibility;phishing vulnerability;probability model;social engineering attacks;stochastic Petri nets","","","","21","","","21-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection analysis which we perform is based on features extraction from network packets dumps and it employs a behavioral and statistical analysis of communications' progress in time and packet index domain. There were performed experiments in four scenarios simulating traffic shaping, traffic policing and transmission on unreliable network channel to make properties of direct attacks and obfuscated attacks as various as possible.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

However, trustworthiness of documents and actors is not explicitly measured, leaving actors unaware of how latest security events may have impacted the trustworthiness of the information being used and the actors involved. This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357562","HTTP;TCP;big data;chat;documents;email;insider threat;machine learning;support vector machine;trust;usage patterns","Access control;Big data;Computer security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Monitoring","Big Data;authorisation;data analysis;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trusted computing","BBAC;English text exchanges;HTTP requests;actor trustworthiness;behavior-based access control;big data analytics;big data batch processing;chat messages;classifier training;clustering analysis;document trustworthiness;emails;enterprise environments;information trustworthiness;insider threat detection;interconnected systems;machine learning;mal-behavior;network connections;real-time stream processing;security events;statistical classification","","","","37","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","32","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257","Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort","Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses","invasive software","EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware","","0","","36","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail.

Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder.

However even though market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact to overall system cost. How the synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length is presented. For a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is sub-divided into up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters.

Many research works were conducted to improve IDS's accuracy by reducing the rate of false alerts and eliminating outliers. In this paper, we propose a three-stage process to detect false alerts and outliers. In the first stage, we cluster the set of elementary alerts to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove outliers from the set of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem.

Nevertheless, all the features of dataset are not relevant for classifying different attacks. So, feature selection can improve the stability and accuracy of IDS. In this paper, it is proposed that IDS with the amalgamation of best efficient features selected by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the computational complexity of the system. It has been combined with the K-means clustering technique to cluster the specific groups of attacks and Artificial Neural Network to get a preeminent output by training the formulation of different base models.

IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines.

Intrusion Detection Systems are deployed to detect infections, but they raise many correlated alerts for each infection, requiring a large manual investigation effort. This paper presents a novel method with a goal of determining which alerts are correlated, by applying Neural Networks and clustering, thus reducing the number of alerts to manually process. The main advantage of the method is that no domain knowledge is required for designing feature extraction or any other part, as such knowledge is inferred by Neural Networks. Evaluation has been performed with traffic traces of real bot binaries executed in a lab setup. The method is trained on labelled Intrusion Detection System alerts and is capable of correctly predicting which of seven incidents an alert pertains, 56.15% of the times. Based on the observed performance it is concluded that the task of understanding Intrusion Detection System alerts can be handled by a Neural Network, showing the potential for reducing the need for manual processing of alerts. Finally, it should be noted that, this is achieved without any feature engineering and with no use of domain specific knowledge.","","","","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2016.7502344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502344","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Neurons;Training","invasive software;neural nets;pattern clustering","bot malware infections;enable botmaster;form botnets;intrusion detection alerts;intrusion detection systems;neural network;pattern clustering","","","","","","","13-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event. We evaluate various machine learning methods as disturbance discriminators and discuss the practical implications for deploying machine learning systems as an enhancement to existing power system architectures.","","","","10.1109/ISRCS.2014.6900095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900095","SCADA;Smart grid;cyber-attack;machine learning","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Protocols;Relays;Smart grids","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system faults;security of data","cyber-attack discrimination;machine learning;power system architectures;power system disturbance;power system operators","","3","","37","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.","","978-1-4244-2113-8;9781424421138","978-1-4244-2114-5;9781424421145","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593135","Frequency pattern (FP);Information security;Intrusion Detection;System-call sequence;Tree pattern (TP)","Aquaculture;Automation;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent control;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","data mining;security of data","FP;TP;computer intrusions;computer system;frequency patterns;information security;intrusion detection;operating system;sequential mining;short sequence model;system-call sequences;tree patterns","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2136-3;0769521363","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","16","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission.

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8;9781467302418","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","2","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization.

In behavior-based approaches to anomaly detection, the model of normal behavior is constructed from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns. Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Quantitative results are given for the recognition ability of contiguous-bits matching together with permutations.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2003.817026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262509","","Artificial immune systems;Biological systems;Computer science;Detectors;Distributed processing;Intrusion detection;Iron;Object detection;Pattern matching;Random variables","evolutionary computation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","anomalous pattern detection;anomaly detection;partial matching rule;pattern recognition;positive pattern detection;r-chunk rule","","47","1","69","","","Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","31","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion of a physical object (or human) will disrupt the radio-frequency magnetic field and can be detected by observing the change in radio attenuation. This gives the basis for the radio tomographic imaging technology, which has recently been developed for passively monitoring and tracking objects. Due to noise and the lack of knowledge about the number and the sizes of intruding objects, multiobject intrusion detection and localization is a challenging issue. This paper proposes an extended variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) algorithm in treating this problem. The extended VB-GMM algorithm applies a Gaussian mixture model to model the changed radio attenuation in a monitored field due to the intrusion of an unknown number of objects and uses a modified version of the variational Bayesian approach for model estimation. Real-world data from both outdoor and indoor experiments (using the radio tomographic imaging technology) have been used to verify the high accuracy and the robustness of the proposed multiobject localization algorithm.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2432038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105967","Gaussian mixture model;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);Multiple object localization;multiobject localization;physical intrusion detection;radio tomographic imaging;variational Bayesian;variational Bayesian (VB)","Attenuation;Bayes methods;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Tomography","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;indoor radio;mixture models;object detection;object tracking;radiofrequency imaging;variational techniques","VB-GMM algorithm;indoor experiment;low-data-rate wireless network;multiobject intrusion detection;multiobject intrusion localization;object tracking;outdoor experiment;physical intrusion detection;radio attenuation;radio tomographic imaging technology;radiofrequency magnetic field;variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model algorithm","","0","","42","","2015-05-12","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior.

For the structural-cluster approach, protein structural segments are grouped into different structural clusters using multiple structural alignments and unsupervised clustering algorithms. The support vector machine (SVM) has shown superior classification performance in various bioinformatics applications because of its strong generalization capability. In order to overcome disadvantages of building one SVM over the whole sample space, the clustering support vector machine (CSVM) was proposed to predict distance matrices, torsion angles, and secondary structures for backbone -carbon atoms of protein sequence segments.

In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on KDD 99 database which is considered a de facto benchmark for evaluating the performance of intrusions detection algorithm. All binary-classes are tested and our proposed approach obtains a realistic performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","","978-1-4799-5147-5;9781479951475","","10.1109/FSKD.2014.6980966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980966","","Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Resource management;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","decision making;least squares approximations;security of data;statistical analysis;support vector machines","IDS;KDD 99 database;OA-LS-SVM;binary-classes;de facto benchmark;decision making;intrusion detection system;optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine;performance evaluation;statistical framework","","0","","25","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While popular systems like Snort are used in many network locations, comprehensive deployment across Tier-1 service provider networks is costly due to the need for high-speed monitors at many network ingress points. Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces. The duration of prediction effectiveness is an issue for ML approaches and more so in resource intensive network applications.

There are three main factors that make ad hoc networks more vulnerable: (a) nodes can overhear other nodes announcements, (b) nodes can lie about their location, and (c) nodes can avoid detection and isolation by moving. As a result, malicious nodes can fake their position and this way obstruct the routing. In this work, we explain how location and topology related malice can affect the security of wireless ad hoc networks.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN). Therefore, IIDS is able to detect the intrusions/attacks both from the outer Internet and an inner LAN.

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

Evolution is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, in which the genotypes are treated as genetic regula- tory networks.

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918856","digital world;electronic circuit;rough set","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Electronic circuits;Logic gates;Set theory","logic gates;rough set theory","artificial intelligence based approach;circuit miniaturization;decision rules;electronic circuit;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We contribute to both theory and practice of this phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that precisely explains it and using extensive experiments to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype by commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with very low location errors of 0.75 m in average (with a deployment spacing of 0.6 m).","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2429657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7112553","Critical state;device-free;passive RFID tag;tracking","Couplings;Dipole antennas;Inductance;Interference;RFID tags","object detection;object tracking;radio tracking;radiofrequency identification;telecommunication security","RFID reader;Twins passive RFID tags;Twins-based intrusion detection;active RFID tags;critical state phenomenon;device-free object tracking;device-free solution;interference model;intruders;localization systems;motion detection method;moving object detection;noncooperative object monitoring;sensors;tracking systems","","1","","33","","2015-05-25","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network. The experiments show good detection quality and illustrate the usefulness of adapting to normality.","1545-0678;15450678","0-7695-2328-5;0769523285","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437175","","Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Electronic mail;Face detection;Indexing;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Testing","IP networks;data mining;data structures;pattern clustering;real-time systems;telecommunication security","ADW ICE;IP network;KDD data set;anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering;data mining techniques;data structures;grid-based index;real-time anomaly detection","","1","","15","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many studies have been done on cloud computing security issues, but research into VM security issues, especially regarding VM network traffic anomalous behavior detection, remains inadequate. More and more studies show that communication among internal nodes exhibits complex patterns. Communication among VMs in cloud computing is invisible. Researchers find such issues challenging, and few solutions have been proposed???leaving cloud computing vulnerable to network attacks. This paper proposes a model that uses Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to implement traffic redirection.

However, IDSs generate a high amount of false alerts exceeding the administrator ability for analysis and omit several attacks which can threaten the network security. In this paper, a two-stage process based on data mining and optimization is proposed having as input the outcome of multiple IDSs. In the first stage, for each IDS the set of elementary alerts is clustered to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove false positives from the sets of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the second stage, we discard the meta-alerts generated by all IDSs and only those missed by one, two or most of them are left. This set is called the set of potential false negatives. In fact, at this level a meta-alerts fusion is performed to avoid the redundancy between meta-alerts collected from multiple IDSs. Finally, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify the potential false negatives either as real attacks or not. Experimental results show that our proposed process outperforms concurrent methods by significantly reducing the rate of false positives and false negatives.","","978-1-4673-8659-3;9781467386593","","10.1109/CIS.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397096","binary classification;binary optimization;clustering;false negatives;false positives;intrusion detection systems","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Redundancy;Security;Testing;Training","computer network security;data mining;optimisation;pattern classification","IDS;binary classification algorithm;binary optimization problem;computer network protection;computer network security;data mining;elementary alerts;false alerts;false negative identification;false positive identification;intrusion detection systems;meta-alert fusion;security infrastructure;two-stage process","","","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance.

To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","3","","31","","2012-12-21","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is a challenging task because of the difficulty in understanding multiple attribute spaces and displaying in physical three dimension space. Frequently, the transfer function is designed based on mapping one or two dimensional space to color properties (RGB) and opacity (A). We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. We compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. We apply a semi-automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space.

In this paper we survey and classify the solutions that have been proposed in the literature for this attack and propose a decentralized scheme for intrusion detection based on the theory of diffusion of innovations.

In the past decades, these systems were isolated and use proprietary software, operating systems, and protocols. In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

These honest neighbors prevent false accusations, and also allow manager if it is wrongly misbehaving, but if manger repeats its misbehaving then it will lose its management degree.","","978-1-4244-6708-2;9781424467082","","10.1109/UMEDIA.2010.5543917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543917","","Authentication;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","computer network management;computer network security;groupware;open systems","collaborative honest neighbour;distributed architecture;hierarchical architecture;hybrid architecture;intrusion detection system;management degree;zone manager","","0","","12","","","5-6 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a new alert correlation method to automatically extract multi-step attack scenarios. This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets. Our experiments show our approach can effectively construct multi-step attack scenarios and give high level view of intruder intentions.","","978-1-4244-9494-1;9781424494941","","10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929072","Alert correlation;attack graph;multi-step attack","Correlation;Data mining;Humans;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Sensors","security of data","IDS generated alerts;alert correlation method;alert winnowing phase;automatic attack scenario;correlation rule definitions;domain knowledge;meta alerts;multiphase process;multistep attack graph;multistep attack scenarios","","1","2","26","","","4-7 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development of cost-efficient algorithms to address these types of non-technical losses also targets the reduction of commercial losses because the full protection of an information system is very expensive. Thus, this work proposes a strategy to detect non-technical losses using a multivariate control chart that establishes a reliable region for monitoring the measured variance. After the detection of non-technical losses, a pathfinding procedure based on the A-Star algorithm is able to locate the consumption point with the non-technical loss. Moreover, a geographical information system application displays the consumption point that is the target of the cyber-attack.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well.

Neural networks method is a promising technique which has been used in many classification problems. The neural network component will implement the neural approach, which is based on the assumption that each user is unique and leaves a unique footprint on a computer system when using it. If a user's footprint does not match his/her reference footprint based on normal system activities, the system administrator or security officer can be alerted to a possible security breach.

Sensitive and vital data have a key character in organizing and storing within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. The existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the Data-Base (DB-IDS) is a necessity because enterprises awash in data often struggle to answer basic question about detecting or preventing all facet of their threat. In this paper, we propose a novel type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level) in a high-rate transaction processing. For simplicity, our model is divided into two parts; detection method at transaction level and inter-transaction level (detection with learning method, concurrently in both level). Detection method at transaction level is based on describing the expected (normal) transactions within the database applications. This is also focused on anomaly detection and used data mining to find dependency and sequence rules (the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity) in where inter-transaction level is used. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. Simulation and implementation experiments in Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI) revealed the accuracy of our models. The experiment results demonstrated the true positive detection rate is higher than 0.8, and the false positive detection rate is lower than 0.1 choosing appropriate ranges for support and confidence thresholds. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4673-6987-9;9781467369879","","10.1109/InfoSec.2015.7435514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435514","Data Mining;Database Security;Intrusion Detection System;State machine;Transaction Rules","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","Big Data;data mining;database management systems;security of data","DB-IDS;MCI;access control;anomaly detection;authentication;big data transaction;confidence thresholds;data mining;database transaction level;dependency rules;encryption;enterprise organizations;enterprises;high-rate transaction processing;intertransaction level;malicious behaviors detection;mobile telecommunication company of Iran;multilayered database intrusion detection system;sequence rules;specification-based detection","","","","16","","","15-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is because in many real application scenarios, normal connection records are easy to be obtained, but attack records are not so. We propose an anomaly detection model based on One-class SVM to detect network intrusions. The one-class SVM adopts only normal network connection records as the training dataset. But after being trained, it is able to recognize normal from various attacks. This just meets the requirements of the anomaly detection.

This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naive Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7;9781467313667","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time. At last, the scheme was built in the company's test environment, then the test environment was attacked by penetration test which is to simulate the act of hacking, the feasibility and function of it are verified by the testing.","","","","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502282","Cloud computing;Cloud security;Correlation analysis;Secure Management Scheme;Vulnerability scan","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Correlation;Information security;Servers","Big Data;cloud computing;security of data","Big Data;Nagios;Nikto security tool;Sandcat security tool;Splunk;cloud computing security;correlation analysis;hacker attack detection;information security;regular network security self-testing;secure management scheme;system log collection;test environment;vulnerability scan","","","","27","","","9-10 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163","domain adaptation;flow-based classification","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training","cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols","confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature","","6","","29","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","1","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once authenticated and associated with the access point, the user can easily move around in the transmission range of the access point without losing data or network connection enjoying bandwidths of the order of multiples of 10 Mega bytes. On the negative side, these wireless LANs tend to have fuzzy boundaries, making it easy for an intruder to capture these transmission signals with a receiving device fitted with a sensitive antenna.

This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

So from security perspective, to identify the attack in its initial stage and to minimize the impact of attack, it is important to detect scanning activities in a network. We have mainly considered TCP flow because most of the Internet application uses it as a transport protocol. Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host. The proposed method provides a generic solution to SYN scan (half open), connect scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan and null scan.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

Although encryption helps to increase network security level, it is not sufficient to protect against malicious intruders. An intrusion detection scheme is proposed in this paper based on cross layer feature collection from the medium access control (MAC) and network layers. The proposed method employs an hierarchical configuration that avoids using a clustering algorithm and, instead, sequentially activates the promiscuity (ability to sniff all packets transmitted by nodes within radio range) of the node based on its location in the network. The node in this case acts as a pseudo cluster head (PCH) that collects data from its neighboring nodes in each quadrant in the field and then uses this information to calculate an anomaly index (AI) in each quadrant. The mechanism uses a C4.5 decision tree to learn the network behavior under blackhole attack and is able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to 97% accuracy. The presented approach is twofold - it is energy efficient and has a high degree of intrusion detection with low overhead.","","978-1-4673-8450-6;9781467384506","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430139","","Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","access protocols;cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","C4.5 decision tree;MANET;anomaly index;blackhole attack;clustering algorithm;cross layer intrusion detection;hierarchical configuration;intrusion detection scheme;medium access control;mobile ad hoc network;network security level;pseudocluster head;pseudoclustering scheme;wireless network","","","","15","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining has shown great potential in extracting valuable knowledge from large databases. However, current data mining algorithms and tools are costly and several are too complex in their operations when dealing with large databases. In recent years, agents have become a popular paradigm in computing, because its autonomous, flexible and provides intelligence. Embedding agents in the current data mining processes and tools are believed to be able to solve the obstacle. One of the most important process in data mining is data preprocessing. It is reported that 60% of the data mining project is on preprocessing. Data preprocessing involves integration, selection, cleaning and transformation of data set that will be used for mining. This paper focuses on an agent-based preprocessing framework. The aims is to provides an auto preprocessing a set of new data, which suite to data mining novice user. The proposed agent based preprocessing framework consists of seven agents: user interface agents, coordinator agent, identify agent, CleanMiss agent, CleanNoisy agent, transformation agent and discretization agent. User interface agent is designed in such a way to provide interface suite to novice users. Coordinator agent is responsible for coordinating and cooperating with all other agents to achieve the goals. Identify agent responsible to provide an adaptive user data cleaning profiling.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, an increased accuracy is needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to find optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a reasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization service, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the infrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an adaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical location estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about solving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models. We demonstrate the usability of our approach in a real-world environment and analyse Geolocation for the first time in Europe.

Some redundant sample points and noisy points are firstly removed in this paper according to the distance in high-dimensional feature space. And K-nearest neighbor algorithm guarantees sample points removed is the noise points. Then the remaining sample points provide an SVM with high quality samples that likely to carry most of the support vectors(SVs) such that they maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. Because different network protocols have different attributes, which must affect the detection effect. This paper proposes cooperative network intrusion detection based on SVMs. Three types of detecting agents are generated according to TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol.

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

Web applications are under siege from cyber criminals seeking to steal confidential information and disable or damage the services offered by these application. Therefore, additional steps must be taken to ensure data security and integrity of the applications. In this paper we propose an innovative solution to filter the SQL injection attack using SNORT IDS. The proposed detection technique uses SNORT tool by augmenting a number of additional SNORT rules.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do so, we designed a three-phase approach. It is composed of the cloning of the target client's infrastructure to perform the subsequent audit operations on a clone, followed by the analysis of network access controls to determine the network accessibilities in the cloned infrastructure. Using evaluation traffic we modeled and generated, the last phase of the approach, presented in this paper, focuses on executing attack campaigns following an optimized algorithm. The NIDS alerts are analyzed and evaluation metrics are computed.

The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the detection protocol, different nodes play different roles, and use different monitor schemes. Virtual cluster head and monitor nodes are elected. Monitor nodes monitor cluster head, and report to virtual cluster head. Virtual cluster head broadcasts abnormal cluster head to all member nodes, and initiates a new cluster head election. Member nodes are monitored by their cluster head. Simulation shows that, the detection protocol can real-time predict traffic attacks, and consume less energy.

These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","6","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the on-going discovery of runtime software vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, it is critical to be able to gauge the integrity of a Cloud server as it operates. In this paper, we propose scoped invariants as a primitive for analyzing the software system for its integrity properties. We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism. The violation of this property demonstrates that the attacker only needs to modify a single byte in the Global Descriptor Table to achieve his goal.","","978-1-4244-9405-7;9781424494057","978-0-7695-4302-4;9780769543024","10.1109/CloudCom.2010.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708514","Xen;integrity modeling;invariants detection;tools","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Servers;Software;Software measurement","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;virtual machines","Xen virtual machine manager;cloud computing security;cloud server;global descriptor table;runtime integrity;scoped invariant perspective;software vulnerabilities","","2","","28","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","17","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application.

The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise.

To enhance security in <i>ad hoc</i> networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of other nodes without central authorities. An information-theoretic framework is presented, to quantitatively measure trust and build a novel trust model (FAPtrust) with multiple trust decision factors. These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

The automation system usually contains a rather accurate time source, which could be used to derive the time base for all system components, including the above-mentioned security mechanisms. A number of standard protocols exist for time synchronization. It will be shown that these protocols do not fulfill the necessary security requirements.

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4673-0228-9;9781467302289","978-1-4673-0227-2;9781467302272","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders becoming smarter in obfuscating web requests to evade detection combined with increasing volumes of web traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-hosted and on-premise business applications have made it evident that the existing approaches of mostly static signature lack the ability to cope with novel signatures. A SQLIA detection and prevention solution can be achieved through exploring an alternative bio-inspired supervised learning approach that uses input of labelled dataset of numerical attributes in classifying true positives and negatives. We present in this paper a Numerical Encoding to Tame SQLIA (NETsQlIA) that implements a proof of concept for scalable numerical encoding of features to a dataset attributes with labelled class obtained from deep web traffic analysis. In the numerical attributes encoding: the model leverages proxy in the interception and decryption of web traffic. The intercepted web requests are then assembled for front-end SQL parsing and pattern matching by applying traditional Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This paper is intended for a technique of numerical attributes extraction of any size primed as an input dataset to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented using Two-Class Averaged Perceptron (TCAP) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TCLR) respectively.

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type opportunistic adversaries. This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions.

However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant.

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions. The FASTER (Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration) project aims at introducing a complete methodology to allow designers to easily implement a system specification on a platform which includes a general purpose processor combined with multiple accelerators running on an FPGA, taking as input a high-level description and fully exploiting, both at design time and at run time, the capabilities of partial dynamic reconfiguration. The goal is that for selected application domains, the FASTER toolchain will be able to reduce the design and verification time of complex reconfigurable systems providing additional novel verification features that are not available in existing tool flows.","","978-1-4673-2570-7;9781467325707","978-1-4673-2571-4;9781467325714","10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322881","","Computer architecture;Context;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Runtime;Schedules;Software","customer satisfaction;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","FASTER project;FASTER toolchain;FPGA;Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration project;complex reconfigurable systems;customer satisfaction;customer tracking;design time reduction;general purpose processor;hardware accelerators;hardware adaptation;high-level description;market trends;partial dynamic reconfiguration;performance efficiency;power efficiency;product lifetime;smart technologies;software adaptivity;system specification;technology trends;user applications;verification time reduction","","1","","14","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system is evaluated by DARPA dataset. The connections selected from DARPA is preprocessed and feature range is converted into [-1, 1].

In particular, many anomaly detection systems employ CFGs. Unfortunately, typical CFG-based systems rely on inaccurate or impractical heuristics. For example, the state space may be restricted by considering only a call graph, thus reducing accuracy and precision. In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems. We anticipate this technique can be used to detect jump-based return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks on the Linux platform.","2325-6648;23256648","","","10.1109/DSNW.2013.6615519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615519","","Flow graphs;Malware;Monitoring;Programming;Radiation detectors","Linux;flow graphs;security of data","BARLEY;CFG;Linux platform;ROP attacks;anomalous behavior;anomaly detection systems;call graph;control flow graphs;jump-based return-oriented programming attack detection;program behavior modelling;program execution;resource consumption information;resource usage;state space","","0","","16","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of this profile data is currently based on command-line instructions/directives executed by users on a system. With the advent and extensive usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line data can no longer fully represent user's complete behavior which is essential for effectively detecting the anomalies in these GUI based systems. Collection of user behavior data is a slow and time consuming process. In this paper, we present a new approach to automate the generation of user data by parameterizing user behavior in terms of user intention (malicious/normal), user skill level, set of applications installed on a machine, mouse movement and keyboard activity. The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized. The framework is called USim which can achieve rapid generation of user behavior data based on these templates for GUI based systems. The data thus generated can be utilized for rapidly training and testing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and improving their detection precision.","1080-241X;1080241X","0-7695-2559-8;0769525598","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612860","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data engineering;Discrete event simulation;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Keyboards;Laboratories;Mice;System testing","graphical user interfaces;security of data","IDSes;USim;anomaly detection system;graphical user interface;intrusion detection system;user behavior simulation","","1","1","25","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4673-4942-0;9781467349420","978-1-4673-4940-6;9781467349406","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The process of discovering interesting patterns in such large data sets is referred to as data mining. Outlier detection is a data mining task consisting in the discovery of observations which deviate substantially from the rest of the data, and has many important practical applications. Outlier detection in very large data sets is however computationally very demanding and currently requires highperformance computing facilities. We propose a family of parallel algorithms for Graphic Processing Units (GPU), derived from two distance-based outlier detection algorithms: the BruteForce and the SolvingSet.

In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2210217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6248214","Computer security;checkpointing;information security;intrusion detection;operating systems;system recovery;virtual machine monitors","Couplings;Forensics;Monitoring;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","computer forensics;data privacy","computer systems;data access;data exfiltration attempts;data provenance;forensic analysis;forensic layer records;forensic platform;hypervisor;multiple disks;privacy breaches;tracking mechanism;version-based audit log;virtualized environment","","0","","37","","2012-07-24","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this context, the contribution of this paper is multifold. First, it gathers, categorizes, thoroughly evaluates the most popular attacks on 802.11 and analyzes their signatures. Second, it offers a publicly available dataset containing a rich blend of normal and attack traffic against 802.11 networks. A quite extensive first-hand evaluation of this dataset using several machine learning algorithms and data features is also provided.

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","20030521","2003","","","44","61","A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-1940-7;0769519407","","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327","","Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic","","26","30","20","","","11-14 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions.

Reliable detection of network intrusions is an important problem, misclassification of an intrusion is an issue in and of itself reducing overall accuracy of detection. A variety of potential methods exist to develop an improved system to perform classification more accurately. Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly. In particular, classification using the ensemble algorithm, StackingC, with F-Measure performance and derived Information Gain Ratio, as well as their subsequent correlation as a combined measure, is presented.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F-Measure performance;StackingC;data retrieval;ensemble algorithm;ensemble learning;feature pairings;feature selection;information gain ratio;information retrieval;misclassification;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;reliable detection","","","","20","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional MAS-based distributed IDSs commonly do their detection work within a framework that employs the method of distributed data collection and hierarchical data analysis. This is a simple and strict method, but it restricts the characteristic of distributing, intelligence and real-time response badly.

An attacker may spoof the identity of legitimate users before implementing more serious attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that employ multi-layer approach to help towards mitigating network attacks, offer high detection accuracy rate and low numbers of false alarms. Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers.

Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works on trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of network dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770276","Aggregation;MANET;Propagation;Security;Trust Computations","Ad hoc networks;Measurement;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Sensors","computational complexity;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;computational complexity constraint;mobile ad hoc networks;network dynamics;security services;trust computations;trust computing;trust dynamics","","51","","144","","2011-05-19","Second Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors.

Li","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Network operators rely on security services to protect their IT infrastructures. Different kinds of network security policies are defined globally and distributed among multiple security middleboxes deployed in networks. However, due to the complexity of security policy, it is inefficient to directly employ existing path-wise enforcement approaches. This paper models the enforcement of network security policy as the set-covering problem, and designs a computational-geometry-based policy space analysis (PSA) tool for set operations of security policy. Leveraging the PSA, this paper first investigates the topological characteristics of different types of policies. This heuristic information reveals intrinsic complexities of security policy and guides the design of our enforcement approach. Then the paper proposes a scope-wise policy enforcement algorithm that selects a modest number of enforcement network nodes to deploy multiple policy subsets in a greedy manner. This approach can be employed on network topologies of both datacenter and service provider. The efficiencies of the PSA tool and the enforcement algorithm are also evaluated. Compared with the header space analysis, the PSA achieves much better memory and time efficiencies on set operations of security policy. Additionally, the proposed enforcement algorithm is able to guarantee network security within a reasonable number of enforcement network nodes, without introducing many extra rules.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2502402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362256","Middlebox policy enforcement;policy space analysis;software-defined network","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication networks;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Middleboxes;Routing;Security","","","","","","","","2015-12-22","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly. However, the Random Forest algorithm is computationally intensive and may not work for large datasets. Naive Bayes algorithm yielded the worst performance and KNearest Neighbor's performance was very close to that achieved by Support Vector Machines.

The problem of incentives and efficiency are well known problems that can be addressed in such collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system. With suitable weights defined by experts in the related areas, the inference of the FCM can provide meaningful modeling of the system. Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are updated by gradient descent on a squared Bellman residual, which is an accepted method in machine learning. The experiment results show that given sufficient training samples, the correct weights can be approximated by the algorithm.

Our proposed hybrid and hierarchical NIDS both monitors the payload of network data in the network layer and also analyzes network-based attacks as anomalies in the application layer using statistical processing and classification. Both the advantages of signature-match and anomaly-analysis techniques are exploited in our system. A naive Bayes analysis algorithm is used in our prototype to implement and enhance the ability of our detection system.

Second, a lack of comprehensive labeled Synchrophasor data along with other system related information imposes challenges to the development and evaluation of data mining algorithms that can classify power system cyberpower events. In this work, a WAMS cyber-physical test bed was developed using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Commercial control and monitoring devices, hardware, software, and industry standard communication networks and protocols were combined with custom Matlab, Python, and AutoIt scripts to model realistic power system contingencies and cyber-attacks. An automated simulation and control engine was developed to randomize modeled cyber-power events including power system faults, contingencies, control actions and cyber-attacks. Scripts were added to capture heterogenous sensor data and create ground truth labeled datasets. The WAMS cyber-physical test bed is capable of simulating various sized power systems and creating datasets without altering the hardware configuration.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention. In this way, ESIDE-Depian uses a Bayesian network to learn from both anomaly and misuse knowledge in order to be able to detect either kind of attacks, known and unknown.

This uniqueness in approach is achieved by using network parameters, QoS, behavior of nodes etc. as metrics to evaluate trust. Every trust management scheme aims at providing resilience to the effect of malicious or selfish nodes.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true. Accordingly, we address some methods, i.e. raising timestamp precision, active self- adapting time synchronization algorithm and state turnabout mechanism.

In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision.

Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature.

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes. Weights and thresholds are used for separating suspicious behaviours from normal ones","1095-323X;1095323X","0-7803-9545-X;078039545X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655944","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Paper technology","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","adaptive sinkhole detection;denial-of-services;intrusion detection;security features;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","21","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Data preprocessing for distance-based unsupervised Intrusion Detection","D. Said; L. Stirling; P. Federolf; K.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

L-WMxD , which works on a lexical based mutation engine, is an active defense system to discover XSS before the Webmail application is online for service. The engine is initialized by normal JavaScript code called seed. Then, rules are applied to the sensitive strings in the seed which are picked out through a lexical parser. After that, the mutation engine issues multiple test cases. Newly-generated test cases are used for XSS test. Two prototype tools are realized by us to send the newly-generated test cases to various Webmail servers to discover XSS vulnerability. Experimental results of L-WMxD are quite encouraging.

Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

Specifically, we propose an adaptive, feature-aware statistical sampling technique and compare it both formally and empirically with other known sampling techniques - random flow sampling and selective sampling. We study the impact of these sampling techniques on particular anomaly detection methods used in a network behavior analysis system.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-9539-9;9781424495399","","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982728","NetFlow;Sampling methods;anomaly detection;network traffic","Adaptive systems;Entropy;Feature extraction;Force;IP networks;Monitoring;Sampling methods","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;optimisation;sampling methods;statistical distributions;telecommunication traffic","feature-aware statistical sampling technique;flow sampling optimization;high-speed network traffic monitoring;network anomaly detection;network behavior analysis system;traffic feature distribution","","2","","14","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes two simple biology-inspired approaches to represent the patterns of student annotations and to cluster students based on the similarity between their annotations; the annotations produced were simple highlighting. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm. The proposed methodology can be implemented as an add-on to existing learning management systems and e-book readers, to automatically offer the students important notes and annotations conducted by others (either peers or students in the past) who have similar annotation behaviour pattern and style to the students.","","978-1-4673-2173-0;9781467321730","","10.1109/T4E.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305938","Annotation;Biology-inspired;Chromosome;Clustering;Patterns","Benchmark testing;Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Educational institutions;Humans;Standards","computer aided instruction;pattern clustering;text analysis","annotation behaviour pattern;biology-inspired approach;digital text annotation;e-book reader;learning management system;student annotation;student clustering","","1","","25","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","2157-5525;21575525","978-1-4244-5314-6;9781424453146","","10.1109/IMCSIT.2009.5352806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352806","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Electronic mail;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Web server","Internet;SQL;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;query processing;security of data","SQL;SQL queries;Web browser;Web server mechanism;gene expression programming;intrusion detection;malicious queries","","0","","15","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a hybrid wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS). To implement the WIDS, we designed a simple lightweight agent. The proposed agent detect the most destroying and serious attacks; Man-In-The-Middle and Denial-of-Service; with the minimum selected feature set.

But few has considered the different losses each anomaly might cause. As we know, anomalies with higher significance will cause higher losses. In this paper, we aim to minimize the losses by proposing an improved cost-sensitive GBDT algorithm named LF-GBDT. LF-GBDT is designed to optimize a self-defined loss function.

Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module.

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cryptology tools can protect the storages against non-authorized access, but turned out ineffective when malicious authenticated users attack inside. Also the intrusion detection methods are applied in the network-attached storages, such as, storage-based intrusion detection method and the intrusion detection method based on system calls. However, these methods couldn't obtain higher detection rates with lower false positive rates. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme to merge the two methods with multi-source information fusion technology. The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system. Also the intrusion detection modules in the new scheme can be self-learning and update the profiles by themselves. Experimental results demonstrate that the over capability of new fusion intrusion detection scheme increased by 15%.","","978-1-4244-5411-2;9781424454112","","10.1109/CIS.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376161","Information Fusion;Intrusion Detection;NAS","Cryptography;Fuses;Fuzzy neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Protection;Secure storage;Storage area networks","authorisation;cryptography;sensor fusion","cryptology tools;low false positive rates;malicious authenticated users attack;multisource information fusion technology;network-attached storage security;storage-based intrusion detection method;system calls","","0","","20","","","11-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe a semi-supervised network anomaly detection system. Our system uses online clustering to summarize the available network data. Clusters are represented using extended cluster features that comprise of not only features related to the original features, but also features that describe the relationships between clusters. Each cluster is labeled by the user as anomaly or normal and then a decision tree is trained based on this information. The incoming new data is labeled according to the output of the decision tree. We show that this system achieves much better performance than an unsupervised anomaly detection system. We also show that using online feature selection on the cluster features reduces the decision tree complexity without hindering the accuracy.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502965","","Clustering algorithms;Conferences;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Training","decision trees;security of data","decision tree complexity;network data;network intrusion detection;online clustering;online feature selected semisupervised decision trees","","","","17","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Darknet as a Source of Cyber Intelligence: Survey, Taxonomy, and Characterization","C. Fachkha; M.

In this paper, we present a survey on darknet. The latter is an effective approach to observe Internet activities and cyber attacks via passive monitoring. We primarily define and characterize darknet and indicate its alternative names. We further list other trap-based monitoring systems and compare them to darknet. Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities. Last but not least, our survey identifies specific darknet areas, such as IPv6 darknet, event monitoring, and game engine visualization methods that require a significantly greater amount of attention from the research community.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2015.2497690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317717","Botnet;Cyber;Cyber Attacks;Darknet;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS);Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS);Intelligence;Probing;Security;Threats;Worms;botnet;cyber attacks;darknet;distributed denial of service (DDoS);distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS);intelligence;probing;security;threats;worms","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Sensors;Taxonomy","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;invasive software","Conficker worm;DRDoS amplification investigations;Honeyd;IPv6 darknet;Internet activities;Internet security community;Sality SIP scan botnet;computer worms;cyber attacks;cyber intelligence;cyber threat activities;cyberspace monitoring;darknet projects;darknet sensors;distributed reflection denial of service amplification investigations;event monitoring;game engine visualization methods;largest amplification attack;mobile-based VOIP technology;passive monitoring;scanning activities;spoofing activities;taxonomy;trap-based monitoring systems","","","","231","","2015-11-04","Secondquarter 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.","1098-7584;10987584","978-1-4244-6919-2;9781424469192","","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584418","","Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Correlation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols","security of data","collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system;computer attacks;false positives;fuzzy alert correlation;fuzzy logic","","2","","25","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If compromised, these hosts may inject bogus data into the intrusion detection system to hide their activities or falsely accuse well-behaved nodes. Approaches to Byzantine fault tolerance involving voting are potentially applicable, but must address the fact that only nodes in particular topological locations at particular times are qualified to vote on whether an attack occurred. We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes. The results indicate that opportunistic voting can instantaneously suppress false accusations when the network topology and routes chosen by OLSR provide a sufficient number of nearby honest observers to outvote the attackers.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412993","","Computer networks;Delay;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Voting","ad hoc networks;computer networks;mobile radio;security of data","Byzantine fault tolerance;MANET;cooperative intrusion detection techniques;countering false accusations;inband wormholes detection;intrusion detection system;network intrusion sensors;network topology;opportunistic voting algorithm","","6","","25","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time. To prove our concepts, we measured the processing speed for the developed system on the data generated using Active Directory tested and showed the efficiency of our approach for high-speed analysis of security events.","2379-5352;23795352","978-1-4673-7147-6;9781467371476","","10.1109/ISPDC.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165133","SAP HANA;in-memory;intrusion detection;machine learning;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Databases;Libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Security","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","SAP HANA;active directory;computational-heavy algorithms;data analysis;deep log message normalisation;high-speed security analytics;high-speed security event analysis;in-memory database;in-memory machine learning engine;integrated machine learning library;machine learning analysis;security information and event management systems","","1","","27","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ACSAC 2008. 13th Asia-Pacific","20080916","2008","","","1","8","Pattern matching and regular expression matching are all the critical components for content inspection based applications. But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","","978-1-4244-2682-9;9781424426829","978-1-4244-2683-6;9781424426836","10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625475","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Coprocessors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Impedance matching;Information security;Inspection;Pattern matching","computer architecture;coprocessors;logic gates","AND-logic;AND-logic regular expressions;RAM data;Virtex2 devices;Virtex4 devices;content inspection;dot-star;hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture;packet inspection coprocessor;pattern matching;software algorithms","","1","","26","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
