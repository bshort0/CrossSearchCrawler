The AMCS algorithm uses an improved representation for antigens (corresponding to network access patterns) and detectors (corresponding to detection rules). In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

Furthermore, another complicating factor in that context regards the equipment or devices used on RFID systems, since they operate in frequency bands reserved for secondary communication systems, and consequently they have too few computational resources to deal with malicious electromagnetic interferences. Therefore, in this paper an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed to identify the occurrence of the malicious behavior and to notify the system operator about one specific type of electromagnetic interference in RFID systems - the Jamming attack. The obtained results of the system show the jamming attacks are detected prior of having a significant impact on the communication between the RFID reader and the tag - i.e., the jamming attack was detected even with insufficient power to impact on communication.","","978-3-2000-3736-6;9783200037366","","10.1109/EURFID.2015.7332388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332388","DoS;IDS;Jamming;RFID","Computer crime;Government;Jamming;Modulation;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification","electromagnetic interference;jamming;radiofrequency identification","RFID systems;denial of service attacks;electromagnetic interference;intrusion detection approach;jamming attacks;radio frequency identification system","","","","21","","","22-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, attackers are potentially able to impersonate legitimate Wi-Fi network nodes, including both clients and access points, by generating network traffic with all the characteristics of legitimate traffic. To exclusively discriminate illegitimate nodes, we propose a method of using multiple and multiple-angle measurements of a Wi-Fi network nodepsilas signal strength. In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate.

Current approaches use linear processes developed to handle single incidents with little attention paid to simultaneous or complex attacks encompassing many incidents, to coordination with other organizations, or the ability to scale to the size necessary for large, cross-cutting incidents. We have developed a coordination model for cyber incident management that provides enough structure to enable cooperative operations, but is sufficiently abstract to enable the organizational autonomy and customization essential for effective response for all types of organizations. It is easily understood, straightforward to apply, and versatile enough to overlay on existing organizational processes and structures, both for small, local activities as well as large, cross-organizational ones.

Even a rare vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network security of an entire organisation. Intrusion Detection Systems form an integral component of the mechanisms designed to prevent internet and data communication systems from such attacks. The attacks on the network comprise of information gathering and modification through unauthorized access to resources and denial of service to legitimate users. IDS play a key role in detecting the patterns of behaviour on the network that might be indicative of impending attacks. Majority of groundbreaking research on IDS is carried out on KDD'99 dataset and focuses on either all the attacks in the network or the attacks corresponding to TCP/IP protocol. This paper presents a step forward in this direction where the IDS model addresses a specific part of the network attacks commonly detected at port 7 in UDP. Port scans in UDP account for a sizable portion of the Internet traffic and comparatively little research characterizes security in UDP port scan activity. To meet the growing trend of attacks and other security challenges in the constantly evolving internet arena, this is paper presents a computationally intelligent intrusion detection mechanism using swarm intelligence paradigm, particularly ant colony optimisation, to analyze sample network traces in UDP port scans. This work aims at generating customised and efficient network intrusion detection systems using soft computing to increase general network security through specific network security.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745415","Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO);Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);User Datagram Protocol (UDP);attacks;network security;perpetual echo;port scans","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;transport protocols","Internet traffic;TCP/IP protocol;ant colony optimization;computer network security;computer networks escalating complexity;denial of service;intelligent intrusion detection mechanism;intelligent perpetual echo attack detection;malicious exploitation probability;unauthorized access;user datagram protocol port 7","","0","","18","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are used as another wall to protect computer systems and to identify corresponding vulnerabilities. This paper presents a new ensemble-based method for intrusion detection. This method uses feature transformation to create the needed diversity between base classifiers. In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem. KDD-99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method and the results are compared with some recent works in the literature using the same dataset. The results of comparing the performance of the proposed method with other alternative classification methods are encouraging.","","978-1-4244-2914-1;9781424429141","978-1-4244-2915-8;9781424429158","10.1109/UKRICIS.2008.4798935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4798935","Intrusion detection;classifier ensemble;diversity creation;feature transformation","Condition monitoring;Data security;Diversity methods;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions;Testing","pattern classification;security of data","computer systems;diversity creation method;ensemble based classification;feature transformation;intrusion detection systems","","0","","16","","","9-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks. The functionality of the system was also extended by installing nodes in different geographical locations, and streaming their detections into the central Amber hive.","2330-9881;23309881","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641053","Honeypot;Security Models","Context;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;decision making","DtD;DtP;South African market;central Amber hive;decision making;decision through detection;decision through presence;geographical locations;human capital;modular intelligence;network enforcer;security control;zero-interaction honeypot;zero-interaction security system","","0","","22","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7;9781424400027","978-1-4244-0003-4;9781424400034","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, securing IoT technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection for low-resource IoT devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e. high detection and low false positive rates).","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510811","Anomaly detection;Game theory;Low-resources devices;Nash equilibrium","Energy consumption;Games;Handwriting recognition;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cryptography;digital signatures;energy consumption;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;attack confirmation;attack pattern detection;cryptography;energy consumption;game-theoretic methodology;intrusion detection system;learning algorithm;lightweight anomaly detection technique;low-resource IoT devices;signature detection","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the special infrastructure and communication mode, intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is especially challenging and requires particular design considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","7","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data.

As rule-base IDS can gain good detecting performance, we build a genetic immune model, which is adaptive to rule-based IDS, to improve the IDS's detecting performance of new attacks. As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions. In order to still gain the recognizing performance of the regular ID systems, we use STAT rules to create the initial non-self (or expert) DNA library, and newly found attacking-rules can still be added to the library.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0;9781457713750","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.","1541-1672;15411672","978-1-4673-2276-8;9781467322768","","10.1109/IS.2012.6335176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic","BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization","","0","","31","","","6-8 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters.

Our algorithm uses a semiglobal alignment and a unique scoring system to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder and the user signature, which is a sequence of commands collected from a legitimate user.

However, VANETs have some characteristics that make them more vulnerable to potential attacks when compared to other networks such as wired networks. The characteristics of VANETs are: an open medium, no traditional security infrastructure, high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, we build an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) for VANETs that uses a Proportional Overlapping Scores (POS) method to reduce the number of features that are extracted from the trace file of VANET behavior and used for classification. These are relevant features that describe the normal or abnormal behavior of vehicles. The IDS uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and fuzzified data to detect black hole attacks. The IDSs use the features extracted from the trace file as auditable data to detect the attack. In this paper, we propose hybrid detection (misuse and anomaly) to detect black holes.","","","","10.1109/EST.2015.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429276","driverless car;intrusion detection system;security;self-driving car;vehicular ad hoc networks","Cams;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;mobile computing;neural nets;security of data;vehicular ad hoc networks","POS method;VANETs;artificial neural networks;black hole attacks;feature extraction;fuzzified data;hybrid black hole detection;intelligent intrusion detection system;proportional overlapping scores method;self-driving car communication network;vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","26","","","3-5 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance. We report the experimental results over real network traffic. The results demonstrate the instance selection method presented in this paper is effective for TCM-KNN and thus optimizing it as an effectively lightweight network anomaly detection scheme.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425547","","Boosting;Computational efficiency;Computers;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Optimization methods;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;security of data","computational complexity;extended fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm;instance selection mechanism;intrusion detection;network anomaly detection scheme;transductive confidence machines for K-nearest neighbors","","1","","30","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

Although encryption helps to increase network security level, it is not sufficient to protect against malicious intruders. An intrusion detection scheme is proposed in this paper based on cross layer feature collection from the medium access control (MAC) and network layers. The proposed method employs an hierarchical configuration that avoids using a clustering algorithm and, instead, sequentially activates the promiscuity (ability to sniff all packets transmitted by nodes within radio range) of the node based on its location in the network. The node in this case acts as a pseudo cluster head (PCH) that collects data from its neighboring nodes in each quadrant in the field and then uses this information to calculate an anomaly index (AI) in each quadrant. The mechanism uses a C4.5 decision tree to learn the network behavior under blackhole attack and is able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to 97% accuracy. The presented approach is twofold - it is energy efficient and has a high degree of intrusion detection with low overhead.","","978-1-4673-8450-6;9781467384506","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430139","","Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","access protocols;cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","C4.5 decision tree;MANET;anomaly index;blackhole attack;clustering algorithm;cross layer intrusion detection;hierarchical configuration;intrusion detection scheme;medium access control;mobile ad hoc network;network security level;pseudocluster head;pseudoclustering scheme;wireless network","","","","15","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying blindspots in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attackspsila features for improving the preventive algorithms. The traditional intrusion detection algorithms canpsilat be applied directly to WSNs due to their constraints of resources.

To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, the IDSs can perform other functions like intrusion prevention (IPS), including proactive functions. A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time. The paper also makes an analysis of the features used to classify data in order to define which of them are really relevant for each class of attack defined in our experiments.","1530-1346;15301346","978-1-4244-7754-8;9781424477548","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546735","Artifitial Neural Network;Internet Security;Intrusion Detection System;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Support vector machines;Training","","","","11","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel What-if module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices.

Threat detection systems should be more intelligent because threats are becoming more dangerous. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a potential network security solution for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and information resources. A fast and effective IDS for mobile networks that does not violate the user's privacy or the network's QoS is required. This paper offers a set of flow-based features that can be utilized for mobile network traffic as a prerequisite for a privacy-aware and QoS-robust IDS. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used for reduction of the features. Twelve features in six groups, which represent the user data in mobile traffic, were extracted and evaluated for IDSs. The evaluation process achieved a F-measure weighted average equal to 0.834, and the experimental time was equal to 12.9 seconds. The accomplished measurements have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed set of features.","","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500483","Internet of Things (IoT) security;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs);feature extraction;mobile traffic","Feature extraction;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunications","mobile communication;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PCA;QoS;flow-based features;intrusion detection system;mobile network traffic;mobile networks;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile traffic;network security;principal component analysis;security risks;threat detection systems;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5358-5;9781479953585","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000815","data mining;database security;inter-transaction rules;intrusion detection;specification;state machine","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","","","","0","","12","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
