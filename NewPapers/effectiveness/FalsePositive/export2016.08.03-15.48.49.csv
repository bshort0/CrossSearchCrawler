Most prevalent among them are spoof threats, in which one network device changes its network identifiers to that of another network device. One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients. This paper discusses some of the non cryptographic techniques to detect MAC spoofing along with their pros and cons and the network scenarios in which they can be used. Analysis of these techniques is done on data captured from live test bed. The information in this paper can help the wireless equipment manufacturers to implement intrusion detection systems capable of detecting MAC address spoofing efficiently with least number of false alarms.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772621","","Access control;Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Power system protection;Radio frequency;Testing;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","access protocols;wireless LAN","MAC spoof detection;access control;denial of service attacks;full scale authentication;intrusion detection systems;network identifiers;non-cryptographic methods;per-frame source authentication;power saving frames;security threats;wireless LAN;wireless network","","3","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this, we proposed feature selection based on information gain, which can contribute to detect several attack types with high accurate result and low false rate.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","RSSI;mobile robots;optimisation;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio transceivers;radionavigation","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;centralized coordinated motion algorithm;distributed protocol;gradient vectors;heuristic approach;mobile robots;optimized trajectory;particle filters;position estimation;rapid wireless tracking verification;received signal strength measurements;suboptimal approach","","1","","28","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A new approach to system call monitoring based on authenticated system calls is introduced. An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls. This paper presents the approach, describes a prototype implementation based on Linux and the PLTO binary rewriting system, and gives experimental results suggesting that the approach is effective in protecting against compromised applications at modest cost.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2282-3;0769522823","","10.1109/DSN.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467810","Intrusion tolerance;compiler techniques;operating systems;sandboxing;security policy","Application software;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Costs;Cryptography;Kernel;Message authentication;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;cryptography;data integrity;formal verification;message authentication;program compilers;program diagnostics;rewriting systems","Linux;binary rewriting system;cryptographic message authentication code;data integrity;static analysis;system call argument;system call authentication;system call monitor;system call verification","","7","3","24","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","978-1-4799-0194-4;9781479901944","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation.

In order to detect selective forwarding attack effectively, we propose the sequential mesh test based detection scheme in this paper. The cluster head node detects the packet drop nodes based on the sequential mesh test method after receiving the packet drop reports. This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion. We show through experiments that our scheme can provide a higher detection accurate rate and a lower false alarm rate than the existing detection scheme. Meanwhile, it requires less communication and computation power and shorter detection time to detect the selective forwarding attack nodes.","","978-1-4244-6450-0;9781424464500","","10.1109/ICNSC.2010.5461599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461599","","Batteries;Capacitive sensors;Computer networks;Monitoring;Research and development;Routing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sequential analysis;Testing;Wireless sensor networks","signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","normal packet drops;selective forwarding attack detection scheme;sequential mesh test;wireless sensor networks","","1","","16","","","10-12 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, there are growing rate of computer attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents a model to investigate these problems.

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks.

With the ability to analyze network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going network attack, majority of network administrator has turn to IDS to help them in detecting anomalies in network traffic. The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8;9781467302418","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","2","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9;9781467311809","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","7","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks.

These distributed agents are the first phase of an overall plan to create a smarter network defense system through the collection and analysis of network signatures generated by real security threats. The central database to which the agents report warehouses and analyzes the meta-information collected by the interconnected agents.

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4;1595933344","","10.1145/1127777.1127803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","12","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reach this goal, we specify this policy using 'Nomad' formal language which is based on deontic and temporal logics.

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","31","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior.

A novel hypothesis in immunology, the danger theory (DT), is emerging to meet these challenges. DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal. In order to reduce the false positive and increase robustness for detection system, a notion of multi-tissues cooperation to sense dangers in IDS is also demonstrated based on the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2113-8;9781424421138","978-1-4244-2114-5;9781424421145","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593657","Danger Theory;Data Field;Intrusion Detection;Tissue","Artificial immune systems;Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Context awareness;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Signal processing","pattern clustering;security of data","antigen data clustering;antigen presentation;bioinspired multitissues growing algorithm;danger theory;data fields;intrusion detection system","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analyzing the data collected from smart meters can expose habits and can be potentially used to predict consumers' behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the confidentiality of information in the AMI consisting of nodes with interdependent correlated security assets. On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI. Using our model, we derive the minimum defense resources required and the optimal strategy of the defender. Finally, we show how our framework can be applied in a real-world scenario via a case study.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2332095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840293","Advanced metering infrastructure;Nash equilibrium;non-cooperative game theory;privacy;security;smart meters","Encryption;Games;Nash equilibrium;Smart grids;Smart meters","game theory;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Nash equilibrium;advanced metering infrastructure;consumer behaviors;defender;encryption level;information confidentiality;interdependent correlated security assets;minimum defense resources;noncooperative game;outbound data;privacy concerns;rational attacker;security modes;smart meters;smart-grid AMI","","3","","17","","2014-06-19","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The results are very promising. Compared with Polygraph, the state of the art in polymorphic worm fingerprinting, several machine learning algorithms are able to generate more accurate signatures, tolerate more noise in the training data and require much shorter training time.

The main functions of ISS are to observe network conditions, gather intelligence from distributed sources, and determine what potential attacks will likely happen. We give the detailed design of ISS in this paper. We also implement this system by using a new approach of text-based decision making - distributed preference-based surveillance (DPBS) algorithm.

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine.

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HIDE monitors several network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. Many simulation experiments have been carried out focusing on the denial of service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP flooding attacks. We investigated the detection effectiveness of the perceptron (P), backpropagation (BP), perceptron-backpropagation-hybrid (PBH), fuzzy ARTMAP, and radial-based function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. We present here results on several data sets from different UDP flooding scenarios. The results showed that the PBH and BP classifiers outperform all others.

However, the rapid increase of link speeds and throughputs - especially in larger networks such as backbone networks - seriously constrains this approach. First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics. Flow export technologies are nowadays embedded in most high-end packet forwarding devices and are widely used for network management, which makes this approach economically attractive.","2325-5366;23255366","978-9949-9544-0-7;9789949954407","","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916403","Flow-Based Intrusion Detection;High-speed Networks;Intrusion Detection;Legal Inspection;Network Security","High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Standards;Taxonomy","computer network management;computer network security","DPI;backbone networks;deep packet inspection;flow-based intrusion detection;high-speed networks;network management;packet forwarding devices","","0","","30","","","3-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN).

One important hypothesis of this type of detection is: different user exhibits different behavior in their online activities. The user behavior can be captured and compared. The efficiency of AIDS relies on the quality of the training data. Many prior studies encounter the problem of low hit rates and high false alarms. In this paper, we study the relationship between the user behavior in terms of operating system commands and the success rate of detection.

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.
