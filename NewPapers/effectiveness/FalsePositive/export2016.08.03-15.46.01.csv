They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876","","Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems","","4","","15","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","0-7803-8533-0;0780385330","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","10","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2372315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979242","Cyber-physical security metrics;cyber-physical systems;intrusion detection systems;situational awareness","Generators;Indexes;Power measurement;Security;Smart grids","Bayes methods;graph theory;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system security;risk management;stochastic processes","CPIndex;cyber-physical critical infrastructures;cyber-physical security indices;cyber-physical vulnerability assessment;cyber-side instrumentation probes;graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm;interprocess communications;numerical indices;operating system assets;power network configuration;power operators;power-grid Infrastructures;power-grid control networks;security assessment techniques;security-oriented stochastic risk management technique;stochastic Bayesian network models","","1","","20","","2014-12-08","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Normally such detection methods require payload or packet content analysis. One of the prominent method of payload modeling and analysis is sequence or ngram modeling. Normally ngrams generated from a packet are compared with a database of ngrams seen during training phase. Depending on the number of ngrams found or not found in the packet it is labeled either as normal or anomalous. Previous methods use either presence or absence of ngram in training dataset or use frequency of its occurrence in the entire training dataset. This approach results into many false positives and false negatives. In this paper we propose a novel payload analysis technique for the detection of Zero day attacks against web traffic. We consider the minimum and maximum occurrence frequency of a particular ngram from a packet in training dataset and find deviations from this range to detect anomalies.

The IDN is used to capture packets, de-multiplex packets, detect local intrusion and infer intrusion. The IDC is installed in an administration workstation for communicating and managing IDNs, it can also do the intrusion detection and intrusion inferring. The RA consists of several snoop functions for information gathering. After an attack behavior is detected, the RA may launch some kinds of information gathering functions to the attacker, so that the proposed NIDS-SA has the active snoop ability. Furthermore, NIDS-SA includes the functions of the pattern matching and statistical inference.

An intrusion that deviates only slightly from a pattern derived from the audit data may not be detected or a small change in normal behavior may cause a wrong data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) offer techniques for modeling and recognizing normal and abusive system behavior. GAs can be successfully used to tune the membership functions used by the IDS.

This is due to the flawed assumption that an attacker does not have any information about an ADS. Advanced persistent threats that are capable of monitoring network behavior can always estimate some information about ADSs which makes these ADSs susceptible to evasion attacks. Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate the design methodology and extensive experimentation is performed to corroborate the results.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346858","","Detectors;Entropy;Estimation;Grippers;Intrusion detection;Parameter estimation","computer network security","anomaly detection system evasion;evade detection;intrusion detection system;key based randomization scheme;launch evasion attack;parameter estimation attacks","","","","24","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the existing approaches that investigate raw traffic data, we introduced a feature extraction method in order to detect such an attack from IDS alerts [J. Song et al., 2007]. However, there is a problem that it can be only applied to limited IDS products. In this paper, we present a generalized version of the feature extraction method. To this end, we define new 7 features using only the basic 6 features of IDS alerts; detection time, source address and port, destination address and port, and signature name. In order to detect 0-day attack from IDS alerts with new 7 features, we apply an unsupervised learning technique, One-class SVM, to them. We evaluated our method over the log data of IDS that is deployed in Kyoto University, and our experimental results show that it has capability to detect not only a type of 0-day attack detected in our previous study, but also several different types of 0-day attack.","","978-0-7695-3297-4;9780769532974","","10.1109/SAINT.2008.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604543","","Computer security;Data security;Feature extraction;Informatics;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Unsupervised learning","feature extraction;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security;unsupervised learning","0-day attack detection;cyber attacks;generalized feature extraction;intrusion detection system alerts;one-class SVM;raw traffic data;support vector machines;unknown attack detection;unsupervised learning","","5","","23","","","July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost.

It will, therefore, filter out alarms that are not likely to have a human cause. A previous paper explaining and exploring the AMETHYST concept was presented at the 1995 Carnahan conference. Since then PSDB has produced a single channel AMETHYST demonstrator and placed a contract for the development of an 8 channel prototype AMETHYST system. This updated paper gives details of the hardware and software used with these two systems. Also described is PSDB's approach to the development of AMETHYST's automatic assessment algorithms. These will combine current expertise from Video Motion Detection (VMD) and Intelligent Scene Monitoring (ISM) systems with the unique AMETHYST approach.

Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized.

The experiments with KDD 1999 data demonstrate that MCA works better than the indicator variable approach for both detection methods with the PCC coming much ahead of the Canberra metric.","1097-8585;10978585","0-7695-2390-0;0769523900","","10.1109/RIDE.2005.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498231","Anomaly detection;indicator variables;intrusion detection;multiple correspondence analysis;nominal features;principal component classifier","Application software;Computer networks;Computer science;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;data mining;principal component analysis;security of data","Canberra metric;KDD 1999 data;anomaly intrusion detection problems;computer network data stream;data type;indicator variables;multiple correspondence analysis;nominal features;principal component classifier;simple coding scheme;symbolic features","","8","","27","","","3-4 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","5","","41","","2012-03-21","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The new sequences are then fed to a naive Bayes supervised classifier (SC2.2) that builds class conditional probabilities from Markov modeling of system call sequences. The results of our proposed two-stage (that is clustering followed by classification) intrusion detection system on the 1999 DARPA dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab show significant performance improvements in terms of false positive rate, while maintaining a high detection rate when compared with other classifiers.

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","2","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, for a comprehensive intranet security strategy, such defenses alone may not be enough. An enterprise needs mechanisms to analyze alerts and detect real attacks, and policies on how to respond to attacks. A framework for effective response to detection of misuse or attack is a central theme. The focus is towards security of corporate intranets. We first discuss the access control models that are currently being deployed and used at most intranet solutions. Using role based access control as a base, we develop a framework of interaction of various entities in the model. We then propose a prioritization scheme based on cost of impact in case of misuse and business criticality of transactions. The scheme is developed based on categorization and prioritization of risk and vulnerability assessment results for an enterprise intranet. Alerts are a critical element of a real-time response, but how alert engines operate and filter tons of log data decides the effectiveness of such infrastructure. We propose incorporation of priority schemes into alert mechanisms to develop a more effective intrusion countermeasure against misuse and attack. It leverages the enterprise's investment in security technology to develop an optimized solution to respond to those attacks, by advising the enterprise's on-site administrators.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232418","","Access control;Authorization;Computer science;Costs;Data security;Filters;Information security;Investments;Search engines;USA Councils","authorisation;business communication;computer crime;intranets;risk management","access control model;alert engines;alert mechanism;business transaction;corporate intranet;enterprise intranet;enterprise security;intranet access security;intrusion countermeasures;prioritization scheme;real-time response;risk assessment;role based access control","","0","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MK-SVM can calculate the weights of kernel functions and Lagrange multipliers simultaneously through semi-infinite linear programming, and thus achieve the choice of kernel functions and the optimization of classifier.

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences.

FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as flow key. FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow.

Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0;9780769537160","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Machine learning approaches have been widely investigated in anomaly detection systems. However, despite multiple academic researches, such systems are rarely employed in operational settings. They suffer from long time training, lack of good quality training data and a random selection of features (training attributes). This paper aims to resolve issues of limited quantity and quality of training data sets and investigates the impact of features selection process on the classification performance.

In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X;0743166X","1-4244-1047-9;1424410479","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","20","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks launch large volumes of traffic and consume network bandwidth, thus degrading the quality of the delivered multimedia service. In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected. Simulation results show that better PSNR can be achieved for multimedia transmission during an attack in our proposed framework.","1945-7871;19457871","1-4244-1016-9;1424410169","1-4244-1017-7;1424410177","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284956","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data mining;Degradation;Protection;Quality of service;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;data mining;multimedia communication;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet multimedia transmission;anomaly traffic detection;data mining;denial-of-service attacks;differentiated resource allocation;differentiated service protection;multimedia service;network resource allocation;quality of service;resource management;suspicious traffic detection","","0","","9","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge. It can be used as a knowledge-base for developing sophisticated intelligent network forensics systems to support complex chain of reasoning.

WLANs are different from the traditional wired LANs in terms of their exposure to potential threats, vulnerability and security techniques. Intrusions to WLANs are facts of the everyday life and handling them becomes more and more difficult. Currently there is no standardised reference model which may help to design, compare and evaluate the existing or future intrusion handling systems (IHSs) for WLANs. Analysis of the commercial IHSs shows that they all are built as a proprietary systems which are neither taking into consideration existence of other IHSs nor they are trying to find the ways to establish inter-IHS collaboration which may help to achieve better security for the end- users. Hence this paper starts by an analysis of the features of existing IHSs for WLANs, follows with proposing the new ways to enhance their design, and then is discussing development of such a novel reference model for a scalable distributed IHS architecture.","","1-4244-0543-2;1424405432","1-4244-0543-2;1424405432","10.1109/CANET.2006.279278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4055210","","Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Terminology;Wireless LAN","telecommunication security;wireless LAN","intrusion handling systems;scalable distributed IHS architecture;standardised reference model;wired computer network security;wireless LAN;wireless local area networks","","0","","24","","","19-21 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea is to use ANN models to discover distinct patterns that describe an intrusion activity and use these patterns to train the ANN model which will then recognize intrusions and other abnormalities. We present a border intrusion detection system in which light and sound data from low-cost sensor motes spread out on the field is used to help ANNs make automated decisions and report intrusion activity.

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits","","1-4244-0996-9;1424409969","1-4244-0997-7;1424409977","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646","","Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency","","0","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work color images of melanoma are imparted to classify them among malignant and benign classes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized by Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO). As a part of the preprocessing step, an illumination compensation based segmentation algorithm is deployed. The segmentation process is followed by the proposed iterative dilation method to remove noise from a lesion. Some prominent features calculated from the segmented image based on asymmetric lesion-behavior, border irregularity, color variations and spanned diameter. Finally, these feature vector applied as an input to SVM classifier, which is used to distinguish malignant from benign samples of skin lesions.

We propose in this paper a distributed computing framework that leverages a host dependency model and an adapted PageRank [1] algorithm. We report experimental results from an open-source based Hadoop cluster [2] and highlight the performance benefits when using real network traces from an Internet operator.","2157-4766;21574766","978-1-4577-1017-9;9781457710179","978-1-4577-1018-6;9781457710186","10.1109/WIFS.2011.6123125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123125","","Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Forensics;IP networks;Peer to peer computing;Topology","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;distributed processing;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","BotCloud;IP flow record;Internet;MapReduce;adapted PageRank algorithm;botnet traffic;botnets detection;distributed computing;forensic analysis;host dependency model;open-source based Hadoop cluster;peer-to-peer network;ubiquitous high speed network","","16","","40","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system for databases","E. S. Emrick; Y.

Access controls are used to protect against malicious attacks and to ensure that established database privileges are not misused. Intrusion detection systems can augment these controls by alerting the intrusion response team after an attack has occurred. While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks. The approach requires the database to learn the activities considered normal using training data taken from production. The model adapts to stringent variations of the training data while in operation, reducing the potential for normal activities to be misclassified as malicious.","1062-922X;1062922X","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974450","Database;Database Security;Intrusion Prevention Systems;Security Algorithms","Databases;Intrusion detection;Production;Semantics;Syntactics;Training data","authorisation;data protection;database management systems;digital forensics","access controls;adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system;database privileges;database roles;database security;fine-grained object access;forensic analysis;inflicted damage;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response team;malicious attacks protection;virtual private databases","","0","","18","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Comparison of classification techniques for intrusion detection dataset using WEKA","T. Garg; S. S. Khurana","Centre for Computer Science & Technology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, India","Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering (ICRAIE), 2014","20140925","2014","","","1","5","As the network based applications are growing rapidly, the network security mechanisms require more attention to improve speed and precision. The ever evolving new intrusion types pose a serious threat to network security. Although numerous network security tools have been developed, yet the fast growth of intrusive activities is still a serious issue. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect intrusive activities on the network. Machine learning and classification algorithms help to design Intrusion Detection Models which can classify the network traffic into intrusive or normal traffic. In this paper we present the comparative performance of NSL-KDD based data set compatible classification algorithms. These classifiers have been evaluated in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment using 41 attributes. Around 94,000 instances from complete KDD dataset have been included in the training data set and over 48,000 instances have been included in the testing data set. Garrett's Ranking Technique has been applied to rank different classifiers according to their performance. Rotation Forest classification approach outperformed the rest.","","978-1-4799-4041-7;9781479940417","","10.1109/ICRAIE.2014.6909184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909184","Classification Techniques;Data Mining;Garret's Ranking Technique;Machine Learning;NSL-KDD Dataset;Network Intrusion Detection Dataset;WEKA","Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Probes;Reliability;Vegetation;Visualization","pattern classification;security of data","Garrett ranking technique;IDS;NSL-KDD;WEKA;Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis;intrusion detection dataset;intrusion detection systems;network security mechanisms;rotation forest classification","","3","","25","","","9-11 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
