Bou-Harb","Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University","2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","20160714","2016","","","1","6","The security of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been recently receiving significant attention from the research community. While the majority of such attention originates from the control theory domain, very few works proposed viable approaches to the problem from the practical perspective. In this work, we do not claim that we propose a particular solution to a specific problem related to CPS security, but rather present a first look into what can help shape these solutions in the future. Indeed, our vision and ultimate goal is to attempt to merge or at least diminish the gap between highly theoretical solutions and practical approaches derived from insightful empirical experimentation, for securing CPS. Towards this goal, in this work, we present what we believe is the first specimen ever of passive measurements of real attacks on CPS communication protocols. By analyzing a recent one-week dataset rendered by 20 GB of unsolicited real traffic targeting half a million routable, allocated but unused Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, we shed the light on attackers' intention and actual attacks targeting CPS. Specifically, we characterize such attacks in terms of their types, their frequency, their target protocols and possible orchestration behavior. Our results demonstrate a staggering 3 thousand scanning attempts and close to 2 thousand denial of service attacks on various CPS communication protocols. One insightful observation from our work is the fact that attackers are not interested in exploiting the Modbus protocol; in contrast to most literature works that are extensively dedicating their research efforts to devise secure models for Modbus. We hope that this paper motivates the literature to design secure and tailored CPS models that leverage tangible attacks and vulnerabilities inferred from empirical measurements, to achieve truly reliable and secure CPS.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510609","CPS;Cyber attacks;Cyber threat intelligence;DNP3;Modbus;Passive measurement;SCADA","Control theory;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Protocols;Security;Sensors","IP networks;Internet;SCADA systems;computer network security;cyber-physical systems;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","CPS security;IP addresses;Internet protocol;Modbus protocol;SCADA communication protocols;denial of service attacks;industrial cyberphysical systems security;passive inference","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obfuscation was performed by tunneling the malicious traffic in HTTP and HTTPS protocols with the intention of simulating the usual legitimate characteristics of the HTTP traffic's flow. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic.

The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We contribute to both theory and practice of this phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that precisely explains it and using extensive experiments to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype by commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader and tags.

A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection.

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network.

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too.

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.

We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naive model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection.

This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected.

In this paper, a two-stage process based on data mining and optimization is proposed having as input the outcome of multiple IDSs. In the first stage, for each IDS the set of elementary alerts is clustered to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove false positives from the sets of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the second stage, we discard the meta-alerts generated by all IDSs and only those missed by one, two or most of them are left. This set is called the set of potential false negatives. In fact, at this level a meta-alerts fusion is performed to avoid the redundancy between meta-alerts collected from multiple IDSs. Finally, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify the potential false negatives either as real attacks or not. Experimental results show that our proposed process outperforms concurrent methods by significantly reducing the rate of false positives and false negatives.","","978-1-4673-8659-3;9781467386593","","10.1109/CIS.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397096","binary classification;binary optimization;clustering;false negatives;false positives;intrusion detection systems","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Redundancy;Security;Testing;Training","computer network security;data mining;optimisation;pattern classification","IDS;binary classification algorithm;binary optimization problem;computer network protection;computer network security;data mining;elementary alerts;false alerts;false negative identification;false positive identification;intrusion detection systems;meta-alert fusion;security infrastructure;two-stage process","","","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Commercial Video Motion Detection (VMD) and Intelligent Scene Monitoring (ISM) systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, aided, in no small way, by a technology transfer from previously exclusively military research sectors. Image processing is traditionally concerned with pre-processing operations such as Fourier filtering, edge detection and morphological operations. Computer vision extends the image processing paradigm to include understanding of scene content, tracking and object classification. Examples of computer vision applications include Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), people and vehicle tracking, crowd analysis and model based vision.

We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to vulnerabilities reported in a variety of VoIP products. We identify two specific problem areas (denial of service, and service abuse) as requiring significant more attention from the research community. We also find that the overwhelming majority of the surveyed work takes a black box view of VoIP systems that avoids examining their internal structure and implementation. Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations.

In contrast, more restricted security to the web applications is provided by default deny model which at first, builds a model for the particular application and then permits merely those requests that conform to that model while ignoring everything else. Besides this, a novel and effective methodology is followed that allows to analyze the validity of application requests and further results in the generation of semi structured XML cases for the web applications. Furthermore, mature and resilient XML cases are generated by employing learning techniques. This system will further be gauged by examining that XML file containing cases are in correct accordance with the XML format or not.

In this study, a hybrid approach was proposed to use to detect network attacks. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods were combined to model and detect the attacks. KNN was employed to classify the attacks and GA was used to select k neighbors of an attack sample. This hybrid system was first applied in intrusion detection field.

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates. Our experiments report a very good performance with very high detection rate and low false detection rate when using carefully selected parameter values.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066459","Stepping-stone;connection chain;data mining;intrusion detection;network security","Association rules;Computer security;Cryptography;Data mining;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Timing jitter","Internet;data mining;security of data;telecommunication network routing","Internet;evasion technique;false detection rate;modified association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;network routing;stepping-stone connection detection","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory.

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process.

Consequently, it is difficult for administrators to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. Several alert correlation methods have been proposed. However, these methods don't consider the differences in reliability among alerts reported from multiple IDSs. This paper presents a novel alert correlation approach based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which regards the alerts as evidence of network attack and combines all the evidence according to the Dempster's combination rule, inferring whether the attack has taken place. The main advantage of the approach is that it can eliminate the ambiguity and confliction in alerts and reduce the number of alerts. With the DARPA 2000 test dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can reduce more than 69% of reported alerts and decrease the false positive rate efficiently.","","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469406","D-S evidence theory;alert correlation;intrsion detection system;network security","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Data security;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Testing","computer networks;correlation methods;security of data;telecommunication security","Dempste combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;intrusion alert correlation method;intrusion detection systems;network attack","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile radio;network topology;telecommunication security","automatic retaliation;hacking;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;security mechanisms;wireless ad hoc networks","","114","4","13","","","Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron. This approach also exhibits a lower false alarm rate when detects novel attacks. The simulation tests are conducted using DARPA 1998 dataset.

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-2308-8;9781424423088","978-1-4244-2309-5;9781424423095","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations.

We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device.

Proceedings. 2000 International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","263","272","Among various types of denial of service attacks, dropping attack is probably the most difficult one to handle. This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a uncompromised router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module.

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2007.901875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991","Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network","","belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data","Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks","","6","1","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We assume that the effect of each active intrusion on a particular significant measure is superimposed on the normal operation of that measure; thus, we are able to obtain a complete representation of the overall bipartite graph model by superimposing the simpler graphs associated with each individual intrusion. The key ingredient of our MIDS is the development of a modified belief propagation max-product algorithm (MPA) that avoids the exponential complexity of the original MPA by limiting, during the iteration process, the number of active intrusions that are connected to a particular measure.

In the past decades, these systems were isolated and use proprietary software, operating systems, and protocols. In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3;9781479923533","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","L. Zhao; X. Fang; Y.

This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","2324-8297;23248297","978-1-4244-3844-0;9781424438440","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do so, two feedforward neural networks architectures (one for non fuzzified data, the other for fuzzified data) are suggested, and their behaviors in detecting the attacks are studied.

For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

We propose a hybrid approach that partitions the signatures into long and short ones in the open-source ClamAV for virus scanning. An algorithm enhanced from the Wu-Manber algorithm, namely the Backward Hashing algorithm, is responsible for only long patterns to lengthen the average skip distance, while the Aho-Corasick algorithm scans for only short patterns to reduce the automaton sizes. The former utilizes the bad-block heuristic to exploit long shift distance and reduce the verification frequency, so it is much faster than the original WM implementation in ClamAV. The latter increases the AC performance by around 50 percent due to better cache locality.

In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real <i>http</i> traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","5","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, Host Intrusion Detection Systems (abbreviated as HIDS) have recently gained a noticeable amount of interest. These defensive systems detect malicious activities on host-based applications. This paper reviews types of architecture in intrusion detection systems and describes a threat-aware HIDS architecture model. The proposed model provides detailed discussion on the HIDS architecture and its components.","","978-1-4799-5358-5;9781479953585","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000836","Architecture;Correlation;Detection;Host Intrusion Detection System;Vulnerability","Computer architecture;Correlation;Databases;Engines;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","Internet;computer network security","Internet;host intrusion detection system;malicious activities detection;threat-aware HIDS architecture model","","0","","19","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue, we design and integrate Bayesian Classifier and Snort based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) in Cloud. This framework aims to detect network intrusions in Cloud environment with low false positives and affordable computational cost. To ensure feasibility of our NIDS module in Cloud, we evaluate performance and quality results on KDD'99 experimental dataset.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396086","Bayesian classifier;Cloud computing;Network based intrusion detection system;Snort","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Irrigation;Power capacitors;Silicon","Bayes methods;cloud computing;security of data","Bayesian classifier;NIDS;Snort;cloud computing;cloud resources;network intrusion detection;security issue","","6","","18","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a mobile Botnet detection scheme that detects pull style C&C channel. Our network-based scheme detects Botnet by inspecting abnormal flow features of C&C traffic traveling through VPN which provides a shared path for both 3/4G and WiFi. Through the verification analysis under real Botnet attacks, we show that our proposed scheme provides high detection rate by using abnormal models as well as low FP rate by adding white list and signatures.","","","","10.1109/IMIS.2013.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603663","C&amp;C channel;VPN;abnormal traffic model;detection;mobile Botnet","Feature extraction;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Servers;Virtual private networks","3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;Internet;computer network security;digital signatures;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks;wireless LAN","3G;4G;C&C traffic abnormal flow features;Command and Control channel;FP rate;Internet;VPN;WiFi;abnormal models;mobile botnet detection scheme;mobile devices;mobile networks;network-based scheme;pull style C&C channel;signatures;white list","","3","","19","","","3-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Swarm intelligence plays a vital role in intrusion detection. Intrusion detection system identifies the normal as well as abnormal behavior of a system. The weighted aggregation method is considered as multi-objective functions. We propose an intrusion detection mechanism based on particle swarm optimization which has a strong global search capability and used for the dimensionality optimization. Random forest is used as the classifier for modelling attacks and legitimate set.
