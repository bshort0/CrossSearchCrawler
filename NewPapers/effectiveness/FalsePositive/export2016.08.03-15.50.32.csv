In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, i.e., camouflaging worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm has the capability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time, thereby camouflaging its propagation from existing worm detection systems. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic. We conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed detection scheme against the C-Worm. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our proposed scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041170","","Computer crime;Computer science;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Power measurement;Security;Software performance;Volume measurement;Web and internet services","Internet;invasive software","Internet;camouflaging worm detection;power spectral density distribution;spectral flatness measure","","3","","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","17","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630405","Cloud Environment;IDSaaS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Privacy Preserving;Signature Matching","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures","IDS-as-a-Service;IDSaaS;anomaly-based detection;cloud computing;cloud provider;fingerprint-based comparison;packet inspection;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism;privacy-preserving signature;signature matching process;signature-based detection","","0","","47","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997","","Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security","HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold","","1","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, the false positive rate and the false negative rate are effectively reduced, and the detection efficiency of IDS is accordingly improved.","2379-5352;23795352","0-7695-2405-2;0769524052","","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578878","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Data security;Estimation theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Switches","","","","1","","10","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A masquerade is when an intruder mimics a genuine user in order to compromise the security of a computer system. The framework consists of looking at mimicry in the natural world. Based on this, a model for mimicry is developed based on the principle of indiscernibility. This is followed by a look into the requirements for masquerade detection software. A formal model for an agent for masquerade detection is then derived which discerns the static attributes of the user as well as detects anomalies in the dynamic user behavior via a statistical classifier. This agent is then used for masquerade detection in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of an industrial automation network.","2151-1802;21511802","978-1-4244-8549-9;9781424485499","","10.1109/ICIAFS.2010.5715627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715627","Intrusion detection;formal model of mimicry;formal verification;masquerade detection;natural mimicry","Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;MIMICs;Receivers;Software agents","formal specification;human computer interaction;pattern classification;security of data;software agents;statistical analysis","anomaly detection;computer system security;dynamic user behavior;formal model;formal software certification;human machine interface;indiscernibility principle;industrial automation network;intruder;intrusion detection;masquerade detection software;natural mimicry;software agent;software requirement;static attribute;statistical classifier","","0","","23","","","17-19 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","2162-8998;21628998","978-0-7695-3843-3;9780769538433","978-1-4244-5068-8;9781424450688","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first identify worm characteristics through their behavior, and then classify worm detection algorithms based on the parameters used in the algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze and compare different detection algorithms with reference to the worm characteristics by identifying the type of worms that can and cannot be detected by these schemes. After detecting the existence of worms, the next step is to contain them. This article explores the current methods used to slow down or stop the spread of worms.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.","","","","10.1109/EDCC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950","IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring","Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters","embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management","SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem","","","","47","","","7-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed mechanism does not need parameterizations since all the used parameters are deduced from public real internet traces using statistical approaches and uses TCP delays as a detection parameter. It is dynamic since the detection is proportional to the severity of the congestion.

A new user behavior is considered abnormal when it deviates from its profile. When detected, this anomaly can prove to be an intrusion. This method help decrease U2R(exploring vulnerabilities to gain root access to the system) and R2L(obtaining access to remote system without having a user account) attacks that exploit operating system or software vulnerabilities and which are the most dangerous attacks towards confidentiality and integrity.

Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an IDS is delivering alerts, nor can they react upon these within adequate time limits. Automatic response systems have to take over that task. In case of an identified intrusion, these components have to initiate appropriate actions to counter emerging threats. Most current intrusion response systems (IRSs) utilize static mappings to determine adequate response actions in reaction to detected intrusions. The problem with this approach is its inherent inflexibility. Countermeasures (such as changes of firewall rules) often do not only defend against the detected attack but may also have negative effects on legitimate users of the network and its services. To prevent a situation where a response action causes more damage that the actual attack, a mechanism is needed that compares the severity of an attack to the effects of a possible response mechanism. In this paper, we present a network model and an algorithm to evaluate the impact of response actions on the entities of a network. This allows the IRS to select the response among several alternatives which fulfills the security requirements and has a minimal negative effect on legitimate users.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-1828-1;0769518281","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176302","","Computer bugs;Computer security;Counting circuits;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Watches;Web and internet services","security of data","IDS;IRS;automated intrusion response mechanism impact evaluation;countermeasures;emerging threats;firewall rules;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;system administrators","","20","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets since neither source nodes nor destination nodes have the knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a malicious nodes detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, Merkle tree hashing technique. In our defense techniques we have two stages.

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4673-0228-9;9781467302289","978-1-4673-0227-2;9781467302272","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.","","978-1-4673-6425-6;9781467364256","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124","","Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks","Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network","","1","","11","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HX-DoS attack is a combination of HTTP and XML messages that are intentionally sent to flood and destroy the communication channel of the cloud service provider. To address the problem of HX-DoS attacks against cloud web services there is a need to distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate messages. This can be done by using the rule set based detection, called CLASSIE and modulo marking method is used to avoid the spoofing attack.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290125","Canonical variate analysis (CVA);kernel density estimation (KDE);probability density function (PDF);process monitoring","","Gaussian distribution;fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;process monitoring","Gaussian assumption;Kernel density estimations;PCA;Tennessee Eastman Process Plant;canonical variate analysis;fault detection;industrial processes;nonlinear dynamic process monitoring;partial least squares;principal component analysis","","27","","19","","2009-10-20","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-2201-2;9781424422012","978-1-4244-2202-9;9781424422029","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble.

To get there, they classifies the connections as normal or abnormal, using different algorithms. In this paper three methods are used, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the two-stage algorithm PCA+LDA as related works, and the Direct Linear Discriminant analysis (D-LDA) algorithm as a proposed method. The PCA step in the PCA+LDA algorithm eliminates the problem of singularity but the PCA criterion is not compatible with the LDA criterion and thus may discard the important discriminative information, unlike the D-LDA algorithm which keeps them and gets rid of the singularity problem. In this work, we propose its implementation for intrusion detection system.

We then add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We argue that an execution path of an application is usually not an arbitrary combination of various patterns; but rather, they overlap each other in some specific order. Such overlap relationship characterizes the normal behavior of the application. Finally, a novel pattern matching module is proposed to detect intrusions based on both intra-pattern and inter-pattern anomalies. We test this idea using the data sets obtained from the University of New Mexico.

We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1;9781424457861","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.

These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, most works pointed out their inefficiency in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we address the inadequacy of decision trees for behavioral anomaly detection. We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4;9780769534954","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","4","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Knightly","Narus Inc., Mountain View, CA","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20090218","2009","17","1","26","39","Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","33","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each day the news media report yet another security breach-sometimes a localized single crime or prank at others, a denial-of-service attack affecting millions of people. As electronic commerce becomes increasingly pervasive, the subject can only become more critical. One of the more interesting techniques for enhancing information system security is detecting that an intrusion has taken place. Although intrusion-detection systems have been a part of the information security landscape for over 25 years, their proper role in the overall security picture is often misunderstood. They are not preventative security measures. Most often, they are used as active security mechanisms in conjunction with other (passive) information assurance processes like firewalls, smart cards, and virtual private networks. In practice, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) attempts to detect attacks or attack preparations by monitoring either the traffic on a computer network or the application or operating system activities within a computer. Once such behavior is detected, the IDS may alert a security administrator or it may invoke an automated response (such as closing down external communication paths or initiating a mechanism to trace the source of an attack). If an IDS detects attack behavior soon enough, it might be able to invoke a response to thwart the attack.","0018-9235;00189235","","","10.1109/6.887597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887597","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Electronic commerce;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Smart cards;Virtual private networks","information systems;security of data","active security mechanisms;computer network traffic monitoring;denial-of-service attack;electronic commerce;information systems security;intrusion-detection systems;localized single crime;security breach","","13","4","","","","Dec 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naive bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.
