The cryptology tools can protect the storages against non-authorized access, but turned out ineffective when malicious authenticated users attack inside. Also the intrusion detection methods are applied in the network-attached storages, such as, storage-based intrusion detection method and the intrusion detection method based on system calls. However, these methods couldn't obtain higher detection rates with lower false positive rates. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme to merge the two methods with multi-source information fusion technology. The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system. Also the intrusion detection modules in the new scheme can be self-learning and update the profiles by themselves.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes.

Experimental results show this method is better than other methods reported in the literature in terms of detection resolution.","","0-7803-8647-7;0780386477","","10.1109/ICCCAS.2004.1346374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1346374","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Redundancy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","authorisation;computer network management;data reduction;rough set theory;support vector machines","SVM algorithm;data reduction;identification rate;intrusion detection method;rough sets","","4","","7","","","27-29 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this regard, various intrusion detection systems have been developed for using misuse detection and anomaly detection methodologies. These systems try to improve detection rates of variation in attack types and reduce the false positive rate. In this paper, a new intrusion detection method has been introduced using MinMax K-means clustering algorithm, which overcomes the shortage of sensitivity to initial centers in K-means algorithm, and increases the quality of clustering. The experiments on the NSL-KDD data set indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than that based on K-means clustering algorithm. Also, the method has higher detection rate and lower false positive detection rate.","","978-1-4799-5358-5;9781479953585","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000814","MinMax K-means;anomaly detection;clustering algorithm;intrusion detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training;Training data","Internet;computer network security;minimax techniques;pattern clustering","Internet;MinMax K-means clustering algorithm quality;NSL-KDD data set;anomaly detection method;computer network attack;computer network security;intrusion detection method;misuse detection method","","0","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To implement a reasonable control strategy, a minimal set of routers is computed in a network that can be used to control and reduce damage done by a large-scale attack such as worm or DDOS attacks. Our work focuses on large network while previous works focus on LANs. We proposed rules to choose these routers based on the network topology and based on risk assessment. Many topological factors are considered into the control strategy process, the control router sets selecting algorithm based on entropy was put forward. According to the incidents distribution on the topology, the factor of macroscopic epidemic status is proposed by the method of quantitative and qualitative analysis, which offers administrators the direct decisive advice to prevent network security event from overspreading and minimize the costs. At last, the experiment effectively proved the evaluation framework and the control algorithm.","","978-1-4244-6754-9;9781424467549","","10.1109/ICICSE.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521608","Control strategy;Emergency response;Entropy;Network security","Communication system control;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer worms;Electronic mail;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Process control","computer network security;entropy;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","control router set selecting algorithm;control strategy generation;entropy;large-scale network attack;macroscopic epidemic status;network damage assessment;network security;network topology;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;risk assessment;topology awareness","","0","","9","","","21-22 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our principle interest is to establish just how far such an approach can be taken in practice. To do so, the KDD benchmark dataset from the International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition is employed. This supplies a connection-based description of a factitious computer network in which each connection is described in terms of 41 features. Unlike previous approaches, only 6 of the most basic features are employed. The resulting system is capable of detection (false positive) rates of 89% (4.6%), where this is at least as good as the alternative data-mining approaches that require all 41 features.","1098-7576;10987576","0-7803-7898-9;0780378989","","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223682","","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer vision;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Neurons;Testing","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","KDD benchmark dataset;SOM;computer network;data mining tools competition;international knowledge discovery;intrusion detection system;self-organizing feature maps;unsupervised learning","","22","","12","","","20-24 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","","","","10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982526","Intrusion Detection;SVM and Bat Algorithm","Accuracy;Barium;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines","feature selection;feedforward neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","Bat algorithm;NIDS model;NSL-KDD data;PSO-SVM;feature selection;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection systems;optimization;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","27","","","17-19 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
