The two systems would complement each other to produce a detection system with a high probability of detection and low false alarm rate. The performance of Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) is often poor at sites with long perimeters, with extreme weather conditions and requiring a high probability of detection. Video based detection systems (ISM and VMD) are improving in sophistication and performance. Despite this there are still limitations with video based defection. Firstly, it may be several years before the video PIDS achieve the performance required for long perimeters. Secondly, when there is no video, for example in fog, there is no detection. There is potential for combining video detection with another sensor to reduce the disadvantages of video whilst retaining its advantages. A non-video SIDS would be used to detect intrusions. On alarm a sequence of CCTV images would be captured by a loop framestore system. A Targeted Automatic Verification Aid (TAVA) would then be used to decide if there was suspicious activity in the alarm sequence. Many false alarms have no visible cause, so a TAVA would filter these out. The false alarm rate would be lower than with a normal VMD as a TAVA would need to assess only alarm sequences. If there is no video or it is too foggy the TAVA would `fail safe' by signalling the alarm from the non-video PIDS. A TAVA could use more sophisticated processing than a VMD and still be cheaper, because it could target the processing. PSDB is planning to collect alarm sequences from sites with a non-video PIDS and a loop framestore connected to the CCTV system. These sequences will be used to prove the concept and evaluate the performance of a TAVA","","0-7803-2627-X;078032627X","","10.1109/CCST.1995.524734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=524734","","Clouds;Costs;Face detection;Intelligent systems;Monitoring;Protection;Rain;Smart cameras;Sun;Vegetation mapping","closed circuit television;safety systems;video signal processing","AMETHYST;CCTV images;enhanced detection system;intelligent scene monitoring;loop framestore system;nonvideo detection systems;perimeter intrusion detection system;targeted automatic verification aid;video detection;video motion detection","","5","2","7","","","18-20 Oct 1995","18 Oct 1995-20 Oct 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves induced by the traffic activity, we quantify the effectiveness of network activity models in discriminating normal connections from attack connections generated by denial-of-service and probing attacks. It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized. For application models, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show that attacks using telnet connections in the DARPA data set form a population which is statistically different from the normal telnet connections.

Does ldquono alarmrdquo mean no intruder is present or non-detection of an intruder? The consequence is ambiguity in interpreting the alarm status of an intrusion detection system. Two formulations, consistent with Dempster-Shafer theory, are presented that assist the security operator in distinguishing detections from nuisance alarms each time an alarm occurs, and distinguishing no activity from non-detection in the absence of any alarm. The first representation fuses multiple values of probability of detection or nuisance alarm likelihood, while retaining the dependence on factors (e.g., weather, terrain, intruder activity) that influence detection capability and nuisance alarm occurrence. The second representation associates a level of belief for an alarm occurrence being a detection, a nuisance alarm, or a false alarm, or for the absence of an alarm indicating no intruder present versus non-detection of an intruder.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4244-1816-9;9781424418169","978-1-4244-1817-6;9781424418176","10.1109/CCST.2008.4751282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751282","Alarm interpretation;Dempster-Shafer Theory;Intrusion detection;Nuisance alarm;Probability of detection;Sensors;Terrain;Weather","Cameras;Force sensors;Fuses;Humans;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Personnel;Research and development;Security;Sensor systems","inference mechanisms;security of data","Dempster-Shafer theory;alarm status;exterior intrusion detection;false alarm;intrusion detection system;nuisance alarm detections;nuisance alarm likelihood;security operator","","0","","8","","","13-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These provide partial solutions are ineffective to provide defense against zero day attacks with low false positive rate. We have introduced a novel approach for effective defenses against the application level attacks.

Our intelligent system is ontology base which analyze the input semantically and capable to detect zero day attacks with negligible false positive rates.

Host-based intrusion detection offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of processes inside the host, providing an important complement to network-based surveillance. Suites of eXpert-BSMs may be deployed throughout a network, and their alarms managed, correlated, and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services, thus helping to address issues of decentralized management.

They provide a distributed platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against critical targets, malware distribution, phishing, and click fraud. Most of the existing Botnet detection approaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC, HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&C techniques. The detection of Botnet has been a major research topic in recent years. Different techniques and approaches have been proposed for detection and tracking of Botnet.

Therefore, requested time intervals and requested IPs with text mining are used for user profiles. Users in the network are clustered by calculating optimum k and threshold parameters of KNN algorithm. Finally, over these clusters, new requests are separated as outlier or normal by different threshold values with different priority weight values and average similarities with different priority weight values.","","978-1-4244-9287-9;9781424492879","","10.1109/WCSE.2010.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718362","Outlier detection;k-nearest neighbor clustering and classification;network security and similarity measurement","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data warehouses;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;computer network security;data mining;data warehouses;pattern clustering","data mining paradigms;data warehouse;different priority weight values;double-sided control mechanism;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;network security;outlier detection","","0","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate. We examine a number of tradeoffs in choosing the threshold values by simulating network traffic.

Some of those applications deal with confidential and critical data that must be protected from unauthorized access. Some other systems use WSNs that are deployed in very harsh environments with limited energy resources. Those systems cannot tolerate network failures that can be caused by network intruders. In this paper, an efficient intrusion detection model is introduced. The model uses intelligent techniques to detect intrusions. Two different architectures are introduced. The first architecture represents the level of sensor node, sink node, and base station. The second architecture represents the levels of sensor and sink nodes. This work proposes two intrusion detection algorithms, one uses a supervised learning mechanism to be used on the level of the sensor node and the other uses an unsupervised learning mechanism to be used on the levels of both the sink node and base station. The output of the algorithms is a set of detection rules which are structured in the form of binary tree. The introduced algorithms provided a high detection accuracy using less number of selected features, compared to previous work for intrusion detection, which decreases the complexity and the processing time. The proposed learning algorithms used only 10% of the data for training. An enhancement for J48 classification algorithm is also introduced which decreases the size of the algorithm's decision tree and makes it suitable to be used for intrusion detection in WSNs.","","978-1-4799-8660-6;9781479986606","","10.1109/NGMAST.2015.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373249","Classification;Clustering;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks Security;feature selection","Base stations;Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Unsupervised learning;Wireless sensor networks","decision trees;security of data;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","J48 classification algorithm;base station;binary tree;decision tree;distributed intrusion detection system;intelligent techniques;sensor node;sink node;unsupervised learning mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a new alert correlation method to automatically extract multi-step attack scenarios. This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS.

Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to delete the redundant and noisy features, improve the performance of IDS, we present an efficient IDS based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) method. Kernel methods are the effective approaches to intrusion detection problems. MKL methods combined with support vector machines (SVMs) can overcome some practice difficulties of IDS such as irregular data, non-flat distribution of the samples, etc. Experiments on the KDD Cup (1999) intrusion detection data set show that MKL methods have a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate compared to single kernel methods.","","978-1-4244-6791-4;9781424467914","","10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680860","Intrusion Detection System;feature selection;kernel method;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","SVM;data representation;intrusion detection system;kernel learning method;network anomaly detection;support vector machines","","1","","10","","","15-16 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, with a system that seeks only to define and categorize normalcy, there is the potential to detect new types of network attacks without any prior knowledge of their existence.

We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found.

To solve this problem, a technique called frequent episode rules (FERs) base on data mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where only pure frequent episode rule is used.","","978-1-4244-3427-5;9781424434275","978-1-4244-3426-8;9781424434268","10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770028","Anomaly detection;Frequent episode rule;Internet security;Traffic data mining;weighted fuzzy matching","Association rules;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Face detection;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Web and internet services","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet anomaly detection;Internet security;data mining;frequent episode rules;machine learning;network intrusion;weighted fuzzy matching algorithm","","0","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive and vital data have a key character in organizing and storing within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. The existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the Data-Base (DB-IDS) is a necessity because enterprises awash in data often struggle to answer basic question about detecting or preventing all facet of their threat. In this paper, we propose a novel type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level) in a high-rate transaction processing. For simplicity, our model is divided into two parts; detection method at transaction level and inter-transaction level (detection with learning method, concurrently in both level). Detection method at transaction level is based on describing the expected (normal) transactions within the database applications. This is also focused on anomaly detection and used data mining to find dependency and sequence rules (the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity) in where inter-transaction level is used. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. Simulation and implementation experiments in Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI) revealed the accuracy of our models. The experiment results demonstrated the true positive detection rate is higher than 0.8, and the false positive detection rate is lower than 0.1 choosing appropriate ranges for support and confidence thresholds. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4673-6987-9;9781467369879","","10.1109/InfoSec.2015.7435514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435514","Data Mining;Database Security;Intrusion Detection System;State machine;Transaction Rules","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","Big Data;data mining;database management systems;security of data","DB-IDS;MCI;access control;anomaly detection;authentication;big data transaction;confidence thresholds;data mining;database transaction level;dependency rules;encryption;enterprise organizations;enterprises;high-rate transaction processing;intertransaction level;malicious behaviors detection;mobile telecommunication company of Iran;multilayered database intrusion detection system;sequence rules;specification-based detection","","","","16","","","15-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20040226","2004","","","10 pp.","","Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly a key part of system defense, often operating under a high level of privilege to achieve their purposes. Therefore, the ability of an IDS to withstand attack is important in a production system. In this paper, we address the issue of survivable IDS. We begin by categorizing potential vulnerabilities in a generic IDS and classifying methods used to enhance IDS survivability. We then propose an efficient fault tolerance based Survivable IDS (SIDS) along with a systematic way to transform an original IDS architecture into this survivable architecture. Key components of SIDS include: a dual-functionality forward-ahead (DFFA) structure, backup communication paths, component recycling, system reconfiguration, and an anomaly detector. Use of the SIDS transformation should result in an improvement in IDS survivability at low cost.","","0-7695-2056-1;0769520561","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265702","","Costs;Data analysis;Detectors;Fault tolerant systems;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Production systems;Recycling;Security","security of data","IDS architecture;anomaly detector;backup communication paths;component recycling;dual-functionality forward-ahead;fault tolerance-based survivable IDS;intrusion detection system;key components;survivable architecture;system defense;system reconfiguration","","1","","33","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366;23255366","978-1-4799-0450-1;9781479904501","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","7","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","","","","10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306574","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;DNS;Wi-Fi;data mining;machine learning","Conferences;Cross layer design;Databases;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Protocols","data mining;protocols;security of data;statistical analysis","DNS protocols;IDS;IP protocols;OSI model;TCP protocols;UDP protocols;Wi-Fi protocols;anomaly behavior analysis modules;communications protocols;computer networks;cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;data mining;false alarms;mobile devices;network capacity;partial attack model;smart devices;smart phones;statistical techniques;tablet computers;wearable computing","","","","7","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

In this paper, we proposed an anomaly detection approach that is adaptive to the ever-changing network environment. The approach constructs a decision tree-based detection model for intrusion detection from unlabeled data by using an unsupervised learning algorithm called spectral clustering.

The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes.

Song","","20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF'07)","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2819-8;0769528198","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","10","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers.

They can be too demanding for resource-restricted cyber-physical systems or too inaccurate due to the lack of real-world data on actual attack behaviours. Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368559","Command injection;Cyber-physical attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decision tree;Denial of service (DoS);Intrusion detection;Mobile robots;Network security","Computer crime;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Robot kinematics;Vehicles","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;decision trees;mobile robots;security of data;telerobotics;vehicles","attack behaviours;automobiles;command injection attacks;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision tree-based detection;denial of service attacks;detection rules;disk data;drones;false positive rate;intrusion detection systems;mobile cyber-physical systems;network traffic;physical input features;physical jittering;power consumption;security;small remote-controlled robotic vehicle","","","","28","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3641-5;9780769536415","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222872","Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;decision condition;rough set reduction;system call","Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Set theory;Software","hidden Markov models;rough set theory;security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network security;rough set reduction","","0","","11","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Adaptive Intrusion Detection Algorithm Based on Improved Dynamic Clonal Selection Algorithms","T. Zhao; Z. Li; Z. Wang; X. Lin","Xi&#191;an Jiaotong University, China","Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications","20061211","2006","2","","1073","1076","Intrusion detection systems' adaptability and diversity have been researched for long time. With the development of computer immunology, the dynamic clonal selection algorithm is tried to solve the problem. Based on some improved dynamic clonal selection algorithms, an adaptive intrusion detection algorithm is presented in this paper. According to the algorithm, an intrusion detection system is composed of a self-body antigen set, a memorial immunocyte set, a mature immunocyte set and an immature immunocyte set. An immature immunocyte grows into a mature one if it goes through self-tolerance. A mature immunocyte grows into a memorial one if it matches enough non-self-body antigens in limited time and it goes through co-stimulation. A memorial immunocyte doesn't die until it can't go through co-stimulation. Immature immunocytes are generated with clone and hypermutation methods when necessary. The self-body antigen set is renewed during above co-stimulation. Simulation experiments prove that the algorithm have good adaptability and diversity","2164-7143;21647143","0-7695-2528-8;0769525288","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021812","costimulation.;dynamic clonal selection algorithm;immature immunocyte generation algorithm;intrusion detection","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Cloning;Computer architecture;Genetic mutations;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Satellites","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;computer immunology;dynamic clonal selection algorithms;immature immunocyte;mature immunocyte;memorial immunocyte;self-body antigen","","0","","7","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Leveraging social networks to detect anomalous insider actions in collaborative environments","Y. Chen; S. Nyemba; W. Zhang; B. Malin","Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37203 USA","Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), 2011 IEEE International Conference on","20110818","2011","","","119","124","Collaborative information systems (CIS) enable users to coordinate efficiently over shared tasks. They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions). We compare SNAD with several competing methods and demonstrate it is significantly more effective: on average it achieves 20-30% greater area under an ROC curve.","","978-1-4577-0082-8;9781457700828","","10.1109/ISI.2011.5984061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5984061","","Analytical models;Atmospheric measurements;Automatic voltage control;Electronic publishing;Intrusion detection;Medical services","groupware;information systems;security of data;social networking (online)","CIS;ROC curve;SNAD;Wikipedia;access logs;anomalous insider actions detection;broad access privileges;collaborative environments;collaborative information systems;complex dynamic systems;detect threats;editing logs;electronic health record system;extensive empirical evaluation;insider threat detection models;leveraging social networks;shared tasks;specialized network anomaly detection","","1","","28","","","10-12 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
