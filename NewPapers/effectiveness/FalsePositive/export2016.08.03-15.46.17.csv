Most of the current cloud security technologies do not provide early warnings about such attacks. The early warnings give the cloud administrator or the auto response controller ample time to take preventive measures. This paper discusses our three prediction models that are integrated to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF) namely, The Finite State Hidden Markov prediction model (FSHMPM), The Finite Context Prediction Model (FCPM) that uses a Variable Order Markov Model (VMM) with a Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST), and HoltWinter Prediction Model (HWPM). We compare these models and highlight the pros and cons of each one. The prediction models were evaluated against DARPA 2000 dataset. The FSHMPM has successfully fired the early warnings 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. The FCPM has successfully fired the early warnings 58.98 minutes before the launching of the same attack.

However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical results on both real-life and simulated data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.","1550-4786;15504786","978-1-4577-2075-8;9781457720758","","10.1109/ICDM.2011.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137251","Anomaly Detection;IDCAD;Incremental Elliptical Boundary Estimation;Streaming Data Analysis","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Data models;Sensors;Training;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;batch training;data mining approaches;data modeling approaches;fixed offline training period;incremental elliptical boundary estimation;spatially dense data;wireless sensor networks","","8","","27","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We integrate the Snort (a NIDS) with a custom-designed anomaly detection system (ADS) to yield a powerful cyber defense system, called CAIDS. This system detects known attacks through signature matching and reveals network anomalies by Internet traffic data mining. The CAIDS design integrates two different detection engines for alert correlation between intrusions and anomalies. We aim to automate signature generation into Snort database. The system was tested over an Internet trace of 24 millions of packets containing 200 attacks. Our simulation experiments result in a 75% detection rate on all attacks with a low 5% false alarm rate.

A real-world environment could be different from the environment designed for a testbed. The results obtained, from such testbeds, may not be accurate and reliable. Hence, a quantitative and metrics based evaluation of IDSs is desired. We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment. A quantitative analysis is provided by TIDeS, using fuzzy logic, under varying network loads. We also propose robust metrics to evaluate an IDS.

To overcome these limitations, we apply modular neural network models to detect and recognize attacks in computer networks. They are based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) neural networks and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). PCA networks are employed for important data extraction and to reduce high dimensional data vectors.

The assumption of nodes cooperation is true only if nodes are trustworthy. However, sometime nodes behave maliciously and selfishly by not cooperating in routing and forwarding processes. The purpose of malicious node is to assault network while the motivation behind selfish node is to save its assets by not cooperating with other, so appropriate security measures must be provided for handling the asserted types of nodes. Trust management is one of the schemes that can be utilized for dealing with the affirmed nodes in MANET. However, trust management in MANET is a challenging task because of its unique characteristics. This paper investigates general issues related to each step of trust management in MANET and explores trust management schemes developed for routing security in MANET.","","978-1-4673-9126-9;9781467391269","","10.1109/IBCAST.2016.7429910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429910","Attacks;MANET;Secure Routing;Trust;Trust Management","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Organizations;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;assault network;forwarding process;malicious node;mobile devices;node cooperation;routing process;trust management scheme;trust-based routing security","","","","53","","","12-16 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","2164-7054;21647054","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations.

In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method.

All of the clustered data and detected normal/abnormal signals will be transferred to the database of the anomaly detection model for further integrated evaluation on those multiple observing factors based on hidden Markov model algorithm. The experimental results with the KDD Cup99 data sets demonstrate that the proposed IDS mechanism possesses good efficiency and has a high detection rate.","2154-7491;21547491","978-1-4244-6539-2;9781424465392","","10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5579109","Fast Adaptive Clustering Algorithm;anomaly detection;detection rate;hidden Markov model;misuse detection","Adaptation model;Hidden Markov models","hidden Markov models;pattern clustering;security of data","KDD Cup99 data sets;anomaly detection;detection rate;dynamic adaption;fast adaptive clustering algorithm;hidden Markov model;integrated evaluation;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;multiple models;multiple observing factors;sniffing","","2","","10","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load hot-spot, which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","978-1-4244-2066-7;9781424420667","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-5366-5;9781424453665","978-1-4244-5367-2;9781424453672","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","1","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We recognize a malware, which employs HTTP to communicate as the HTTP-like Botnet. Some parts of the network traffic of an HTTP-like Botnet are different from normal HTTP applications. Based on the differences between HTTP-like Botnet traffic and normal HTTP applications, we developed an Automatic NIDS Rule Generating System (ARGS). The ARGS is a proof of concept (POC), which generates the corresponding NIDS rules efficiently and precisely from the input malign traffic (MT). ARGS is an incremental method to generate and optimize the rules. It can generate rules quickly and precisely without first requiring the collection of many malware samples for clustering. For practical purposes, we adopt Snort as our IDS engine in ARGS. In our experiments, the time required by ARGS to process MTs and generate corresponding rules is significantly shorter than existing solution when the rule-optimization is not required. Besides, the generated rule set can detect more 30% malware traffic compared to SourceFire IDS full-set and thus can efficiently stop the spreading of malware in time.","","978-1-5090-0187-3;9781509001873","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2015.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415791","","Browsers;Engines;Malware;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Support vector machines","Internet;firewalls;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;transport protocols","ARGS;HTTP-like malware communication;IDS engine;Internet;POC;Snort;automatic NIDS rule generating system;botnet traffic;clustering;firewall;main protocol;network intrusion detection system;proof of concept;rule-optimization","","","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.30.75s and a duration time of 0.150.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a DMS, security mechanisms like encryption of documents and enforcement of policies are implemented to protect from information leakage. These security schemes, essentially applications of Digital Rights Management technologies, while effective against external attacks, are ineffective against insider attacks. The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs.

Most existing detection methods use aggressive activities of worms as a clue for detection and are ineffective against worms that propagate silently using a list of vulnerable hosts. To detect such worms, we propose anomaly connection tree method (ACTM). ACTM uses two features present to most worms. First is that the worm's propagation behavior is expressed as tree-like structures. Second is that the worm's selection of infection targets does not consider which hosts its infected host communicates too frequently. Then, by constructing trees that are composed of anomaly connections, ACTM detects the existence of such worms.

The first step is to model adversary behavior of capture attackers and inside attackers which can dynamically and adaptively trigger the best attack strategies while avoiding detection and eviction. The second step is to model defense behavior of defenders utilizing intrusion detection and tolerance strategies to reactively and proactively counter dynamic adversary behavior. We leverage game theory to model attack/defense dynamics with the players being the attackers/defenders, the actions being the attack/defense strategies identified, and the payoff for each outcome being related to system survivability. The 3rd and final step is to identify and apply proper solution techniques that can effectively and efficiently analyze attack/defense dynamics as modeled by game theory for guiding the creation of effective defense strategies for assuring high survivability in military MANETs.

It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying unknown attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-4000-9;9781424440009","978-0-7695-3638-5;9780769536385","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","4","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2;9781467348652","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in the virtual private network (VPN) topology, with the emergence of the tunneling, private routing and cipher technology in VPN, there are two embarrassments for the protection of the entire VPN topology. One is that internal services will be uncovered in the Internet by the tunneling, which can be compromised by attacking the client-side endpoint of a VPN tunnel. The other is that firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) could not completely analyze the network packet content because of the private routing and cipher technology. Based on the analysis of the VPN topology, we put forward the multi-layered correlative control (MLCC) mechanism. MLCC is a multi-layered security protection mechanism based on VPN gateway incorporating client end-point, firewall, IDS and internal services. There are three types of correlative technology introduced in MLCC, which are endpoint extending, component correlation and service engine. By their combination, MLCC can turn the VPN protection into a correlative and full model and improve the security of the VPN topology. Finally, the performance analysis based on our prototype is presented.","","0-7695-2927-5;0769529275","","10.1109/NAS.2007.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286406","","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Performance analysis;Protection;Routing;Search engines;Security;Tunneling;Virtual private networks;Web and internet services","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","Internet;cipher technology;firewall;intrusion detection system;multi layered correlative control mechanism;network topology research security;private routing;virtual private network","","1","","10","","","29-31 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, summarized network connections from the DARPA 98 Lincoln Labs dataset are employed for training and testing a data driven learning architecture. The learning architecture is composed from a hierarchy of self-organizing feature maps. Such a scheme is entirely unsupervised, thus the quality of the intrusion detection system is directly influenced by the quality of the dataset. Dataset biases are investigated through three different dataset partitions: 10% KDD (default training dataset); normal connections alone; 50/50 mix of attack and normal.

Each new proposal and technique arrives with great promise and anticipated success as research teams struggle to develop new and innovative responses to emerging threats. Unfortunately, these techniques frequently fall short of expectation when deployed due to difficulties with false alarms, trouble operating in a non-idealized or new domain, or flexibility limiting assumptions which are only valid with specific input sets. We believe these failures are due to fundamental problems with the experimental method for evaluating the effectiveness of new ideas and techniques. This work explores the effect of a poorly understood data synthesis process on the evaluation of IA devices. The point of an evaluation is to independently determine what a detector can and cannot detect, i.e. the metric of detection. This can only be done when the data contains carefully controlled ground truth. We broadly define the term similarity class to facilitate discussion about the different ways data (and more specifically test data) can be similar, and use these ideas to illustrate the pre-requisites for correct evaluation of anomaly detectors. We focus on how anomaly detectors function and should be evaluated in 2 specific domains with disparate system architectures and data: a sensor and data transport network for air frame tracking and display, and a deep space mission spacecraft command link. Finally, we present empirical evidence illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in these domains, and introduce the entropy of a time series sensor as a critical measure of data similarity for test data in these domains.","","978-1-4244-6047-2;9781424460472","","10.1109/THS.2010.5655105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655105","data generation;experimental method;information assurance;similarity classes","Detectors;Entropy;Generators;Markov processes;Measurement;Radar tracking;Space vehicles","aerospace computing;data handling;security of data","IA devices;air frame tracking;anomaly detector;data synthesis process;data transport network;information assurance technique","","0","","16","","","8-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, IDS play a vital role in network security. Intrusion detection system tries to detect computer attacks by examining various data records, log audits etc. Many existing IDS such as Snort are signature based system. The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments. We observed that MLP Neural network requires large training time. Once it trained, detects known as well as unknown attacks and also reduces false alerts.","","978-1-4244-3594-4;9781424435944","978-1-4244-3595-1;9781424435951","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787714","","Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Data security;Databases;Information security;Intrusion detection;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","backpropagation;computer networks;multilayer perceptrons;security of data","IDS;MLP neural network;back-propagation algorithm;false alerts reduction;intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron;network based computer attacks","","0","","13","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4244-4786-2;9781424447862","978-1-4244-4787-9;9781424447879","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5377998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377998","","Application software;Control systems;Energy consumption;Humanoid robots;Hydraulic actuators;Induction motors;Intrusion detection;Legged locomotion;Robot control;Testing","computer network security;data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","computer networks;data mining;databases process;feature selection;information extraction;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor classifier;knowledge discovery;map data classification;supervised learning","","0","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal. If observation sequence does not match the model, we conclude that the behavior is not normal, that is to say, there is an attack.","2161-9646;21619646","978-1-4244-3708-5;9781424437085","978-1-4244-3709-2;9781424437092","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5601345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601345","","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio","MANET;anomaly detection system;hide Markov model;intrusion detection","","1","","6","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating hard-LANs designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","3","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (Random Forest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (Random Forest-Backward Elimination Ranking). The features selected by the proposed methods were tested and compared with three of the most well-known feature sets in the IDS literature.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1034-6;9781457710346","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine","Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines","Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine","","5","","20","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions.

This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead.

Al-Nashif","NSF Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing, The Univ. of Arizona, Tucson, 85721, USA","2014 IEEE/ACS 11th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)","20150402","2014","","","9","15","The pervasive deployment of intelligent devices in the critical infrastructures sector and the high dependency of these devices on the Internet motivated attackers to target the communication and control protocols of these devices. DNP3 over TCP/IP is among those protocols that are widely used as communication and control protocols in critical infrastructures. Due to the facts that security was not part of the goals for designing the DNP3 and the incompetent of current protection systems, adversary can easily succeed in attacking DNP3 devices and network. In this paper, we present an Autonomic Network Protection Framework for DNP3 over TCP/IP that detects old attacks that cannot be prevented by the legacy DNP3 security devices as well as new attacks. The system's detection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the generated rules in detecting anomalies through both offline and online testing. Both the false positive and the false negative rates of our approach are quite low. In addition, we present a classification technique and an access control mechanism to provide autonomic network protection.","2161-5322;21615322","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073172","Anomaly Detection;Autonomic Network Protection;Critical infrastructures;DNP3 over TCP/IP","IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Training","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;data protection;transport protocols","DNP3 security;Internet;TCP/IP protocol;access control mechanism;attack detection;autonomic network protection framework;classification technique;communication protocol;control protocol;intelligent device deployment;rule-based anomaly intrusion detection","","0","","31","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, without keeping in mind the security issues in the protocol design, AODV is vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. Intrusion detection, as the second line of defense, is an indispensable tool for highly survivable networks. This paper analyzes some of the vulnerabilities, specifically discussing attacks against AODV that manipulate the routing messages. We propose a solution based on specification-based intrusion detection t- o detect attacks on AODV. Briefly, our approach involves the use of finite state machines for specifying correct AODV routing behavior and distributed network monitors for detecting run-time violation of the specifications. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively detect most of the serious AODV routing attacks effectively, and with low overhead.","","0-7695-2284-X;076952284X","","10.1109/ICECCS.2005.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467917","","","ad hoc networks;finite state machines;formal specification;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;ad hoc on-demand distance vector;attack detection;distributed network monitors;dynamic link conditions;finite state machines;memory overhead;message routing;mobile ad hoc networks;network attack vulnerability;network survival;network utilization;processing overhead;protocol design;run-time violation;specification-based intrusion detection","","0","","20","","","20-20 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response to this threat, there is a growing demand for effective techniques to detect the presence of worms and to reduce the worms' spread. Furthermore, existing approaches for anomaly detection of new worms suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting worms based on similar patterns of connection activity. We then investigate how to improve the computational efficiency of worm detection by presenting a greedy algorithm, which minimizes the amount of traffic processing needed to detect worms, thus increasing the scalability of the system. Our evaluation shows that the greedy algorithm not only achieved high detection accuracy and reduced the amount of processing time to detect worms, but also achieved reasonable worm traffic detection in the early stages of an outbreak.","1573-0077;15730077","0-7803-9087-3;0780390873","","10.1109/INM.2005.1440779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440779","","Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Greedy algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;greedy algorithms;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet worm;anomaly detection;greedy algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security;worm traffic detection","","3","","18","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
