This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","2157-5525;21575525","978-1-4244-5314-6;9781424453146","","10.1109/IMCSIT.2009.5352806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352806","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Electronic mail;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Web server","Internet;SQL;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;query processing;security of data","SQL;SQL queries;Web browser;Web server mechanism;gene expression programming;intrusion detection;malicious queries","","0","","15","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235","","Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols","Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes","DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol","","21","","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aircraft technology has improved Helicopters can serve as an intruder transport, a highly mobile weapon platform, and an escape vehicle after an intrusion has been committed. The helicopter can also serve as a transport for a high value material asset that may be stolen. Fixed wing aircraft are also a threat. The suicide mission to destroy an asset or generate adverse publicity is credible. If there is sufficient runway, the fixed wing aircraft can serve as a transport of intruders into a protected site, an intruder escape vehicle, or a transport for a stolen high value asset. The runway for a short take off and landing (STOL) aircraft used as intrusion vehicle can be any cleared area, including roadways only 100 meters in length with obstructions 20 meters high at the end. There may be existing, in place aircraft detection sensors near most sites that can be used to detect an aircraft's presence and provide early warning. If not, there is another family of sensors that can detect, track, and classify detected aircraft as fixed wing or helicopter. This second class of sensor can be installed if high resolution tracking of a target is required.

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HIDSs cannot perform a network-wide analysis and can be subverted if a host is compromised. We propose an approach to intrusion detection that combines HIDS, NIDS, and a version of IPsec that encrypts the header and the body of IP packets separately (Two-Zone IPsec). We show that all of the network events currently detectable by the Snort NIDS on unencrypted network traffic are also detectable on encrypted network traffic using this approach.

Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","7","4","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VANETs are considered as the main wireless communication platforms for the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Service-oriented vehicular networks are special categories for VANETs that support diverse infrastructure-based commercial infotainment services including, for instance, Internet access, real-time traffic monitoring and management, video streaming. Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940213","Intrusion detection;Service Attacks;Service-oriented vehicular;intrusion detection;networks;service attacks;service-oriented vehicular networks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Road traffic;Service-oriented architecture;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Wireless networks","computer network security;data communication;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","DoS;ELIDV;ITS;NS-3 simulator;VANET;denial of service;efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network;false alert generation;high-rate data communication;integrity target;intelligent transportation system;low false positive rate;malicious detection;road-side units;service-oriented vehicular network;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless network","","2","","23","","2014-10-30","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, one of the most significant challenges in this area is the poor detection rate, due to the presence of excessive features in a data set whose class distributions are imbalanced. Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy. The empirical experiments are carried out on multiple intrusion data sets using different commercial virtual appliances and real malwares.","1082-3409;10823409","978-1-4577-2068-0;9781457720680","978-0-7695-4596-7;9780769545967","10.1109/ICTAI.2011.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6103429","area under the ROC curve;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bit error rate;Boosting;Databases;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Trojan horses","greedy algorithms;search problems;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;ROC curve;computer infrastructure security;feature selection methods;greedy search strategy;intrusion detection systems;novel feature selection;virtual appliances;virtual machine environments;virtual server environments","","2","","4","","","7-9 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PAYL takes into consideration the entire payload for profile calculation and effectively for anomaly detection. Payload length is very high on port numbers like 21 and 80. Hence it is difficult to apply PAYL on high speed, high bandwidth networks. We use CPP (content based payload partitioning) technique which divides the payload into different partitions depending on content of payload. PCNAD does payload based anomaly detection using a few CPP partitions. We demonstrate usefulness of the PCNAD on the 1999 DARPA IDS data set. We observed 97.06% accuracy on port 80 using only 62.64% packet payload length with small false positive rate. This is a significant improvement over PAYL approach which uses 100% of the packet payload for anomaly detection.","","978-1-4244-2623-2;9781424426232","978-1-4244-2624-9;9781424426249","10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664331","","Bandwidth;Databases;Frequency;Genetic mutations;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Signal detection;System testing","digital signatures","anomaly detection;bandwidth networks;content based payload partitioning technique;false positive rate;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload length;payload content based network anomaly detection;signature based intrusion detection systems","","2","","18","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries.

We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance.

The effectiveness of IDS is measured by the response it generates specific to the type of intrusion detected. In this paper, we have proposed and simulated an enhanced detection mechanism in a Zone based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS). An extensive simulation is carried out to study the performance of ZBIDS under various routing attacks like blackhole, greyhole, wormhole and impersonation.

In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as Slow-Tech in a High-Tech world. In High-Tech we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the Slow-Tech world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the real world of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This mil-spec environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small spin-off one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger one-stop-shopping companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4673-2450-2;9781467324502","978-1-4673-2449-6;9781467324496","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530","","Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems","military equipment;national security;sensors","Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community","","0","","13","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","7","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is an attack that consumes all the cloud resources may have making it unavailable to other general users. This paper identifies characteristics of DDoS attack and provides an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tool based on Snort to detect DDoS. The proposed tool will alert the network administrator regarding any attack for any possible resources and the nature of the attack. Also, it suspends the attacker for some time to allow the network admin to implement a fall back plan. As Snort is an open source system, modifying different parameters of the system showed a significant aid in not only detection of DDoS, but also reduction the time for the down time of the network. The proposed tool helps minimize the effect of DDoS by detecting the attack at very early stage and by altering with various parameters which facilitates easy diagnose of the problem.","","","","10.1109/IEMCON.2015.7344496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344496","DDoS;cloud computing;open-source;security;snort","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Cryptography;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;public domain software;resource allocation","DDoS attack characteristics;IDS tool;cloud computing;cloud resources;distributed denial of service attack;distributive computing architecture;intrusion detection system tool;network admin;network administrator;open source system;scalable computing architecture","","","","13","","","15-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","2154-0217;21540217","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion. The results on 1998 DARPA data show that the our method results in low false positive rate with high detection rate.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4244-1717-9;9781424417179","978-1-4244-1718-6;9781424417186","10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4582476","","Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Sequences;Surveillance","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","fuzzy HMM;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;pattern recognition","","4","","12","","","3-5 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a hierarchical VANETs intrusion detection system based on BUSNet is present. BUSNet is basically a virtual mobile backbone infrastructure that is constructed using public buses. We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior. The experiments in NS2 show that the detection method can detect anomaly behavior with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-5821-9;9781424458219","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497798","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Neural networks;Routing;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;neural nets;packet radio networks;security of data;system buses;telecommunication network routing;vehicles","BUSNet;NS2;VANET;data packet;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;learning;multihop cooperative routing;neural network;routing control;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","25","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks have been widely used for intrusion detection. These methods generally suffer from long training times, require parameter tuning, or do not perform well in multi-class classification. We propose a basic ELM method based on random features, and a kernel based ELM method for classification.

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this paper argues that current solutions are not able to reliably protect information assets. The analyses of data breaches reported in 2014 reveal a significant number of data leakage incidents that are not within the focus of the DLP solutions. Furthermore, these analyses indicate that the classification of the provided data breach records is not qualified for detailed investigations. Therefore, advanced criteria for characterizing data leakage incidents are introduced, and the reported records are extended. The resulting analyses illustrate that DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) demand various information security (IS) measures to be established in order to reduce the risk of technologically based data breaches. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) measures is significantly influenced by non-technological aspects, such as the human factor.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

We aim at finding suitable configuration for efficiently analyzing large data set in limited amount of time. Our implementation applied Hadoop for large-scale log analysis with data set from KDD'99 competition as test data. With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the Kmeans algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K).

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4;9781424492114","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links.

However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we address the problem considering a novel statistical technique for detecting attacks towards the SIP protocol. Our approach is based on the use of Markovian models (namely high order Markov chains) for modelling SIP signalling traffic. In particular our work focuses on detection of three kinds of attacks: VoIP fuzzing, flood based denial of service, and signalling manipulation.

Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors.

Though the Internet has been designed to withstand various forms of failure, the intrusion tools and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, exposing the Internet to new threats. To make networked systems reliable and robust it becomes highly essential to develop on-line monitoring, analysis and quantification of the behavior of networks under a wide range of attacks and to recover from these attacks. In this paper, we present a hybrid method based on information theory and genetic algorithm to detect network attacks. Our approach uses information theory to filter the traffic data and thus reduce the complexity. We use a linear structure rule to classify the network behaviors into normal and abnormal behaviors. We apply our approach to the kdd99 benchmark dataset and obtain high detection rate of 99.25% as well as low false alarm rate of 1.66%.","1097-2641;10972641","0-7803-8991-3;0780389913","","10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1460505","","Condition monitoring;Filtering theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic communication;Information filtering;Information filters;Information theory;Internet;Intrusion detection;Robustness","Internet;authorisation;benchmark testing;computer network reliability;filtering theory;genetic algorithms;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;filtering;genetic algorithm;information theory;intrusion detection method;kdd99 benchmark dataset;network attack detection;on-line monitoring;system reliability;traffic data;vulnerability","","5","","19","","","7-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Remote-to-Local attacks detection using incremental genetic algorithm","S. Ali; W. Shahzad; F. A.

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the rule based IDSs are not efficient for mutated attacks, because they need additional rules for the variations of the attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system using the principal component analysis (PCA) and the time delay neural network (TDNN). Packets on the network can be considered as gray images of which pixels represent bytes of the packets. From these continuous packet images, we extract principal components. And these components are used as an input of a TDNN classifier that discriminates between normal and abnormal packet flows. The system deals well with various mutated attacks, as well as well known attacks.","","0-7803-8940-9;0780389409","","10.1109/HEALTH.2005.1500500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1500500","","Computer networks;Delay effects;Helium;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Neural networks;Pixel;Principal component analysis;Statistical analysis","delays;image recognition;neural nets;principal component analysis;security of data","continuous packet image;gray image;intrusion detection system;misuse detection model;packet flow;principal component analysis;time delay neural network","","0","","8","","","23-25 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
