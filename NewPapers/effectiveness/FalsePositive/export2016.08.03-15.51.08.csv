This also strengthens the need for protection against cyber-attacks, as virtually any devices with a wireless connection could be vulnerable to malicious hacking attempts. Meanwhile, honeypotbased deception mechanism has been considered as one of the methods to ensure security for modern networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we address the problem of defending against attacks in honeypot-enabled networks by looking at a game-theoretic model of deception involving an attacker and a defender. The attacker may try to deceive the defender by employing different types of attacks ranging from a suspicious to a seemingly normal activity, while the defender in turn can make use of honeypots as a tool of deception to trap attackers. The problem is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information, where equilibria are identified for both the oneshot game and the repeated game versions. Our results show that there is a threshold for the frequency of active attackers, above which both players will take deceptive actions and below which the defender can mix up his/her strategy while keeping the attackers success rate low.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2547994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442780","Internet of Things;Network security;attacks and defenses;deception;game theory;honeypots","Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","","","","","","","","2016-03-29","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Based on the dc power flow model and state estimation model, three behavior rules are extracted to depict the behavior norms of each device, such that a device (trustee) that is being monitored on its behavior can be easily checked on the deviation from the behavior specification. Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers. In addition, based on real data run in POWER WORLD for IEEE benchmark power systems, and through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that BLITHE outperforms the state of arts for detecting abnormal behaviors in pervasive smart grid applications.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2459049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163500","Insider threat detection;security;smart grid","Cryptography;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Power measurement;Smart grids;State estimation","IEEE standards;load flow;power system security;power system state estimation;smart power grids;statistical analysis","BLITHE;DC power flow model;IEEE benchmark power system;POWER WORLD;abnormal behavior detection;behavior rule-based insider threat detection;behavior specification;compliance-distance-based grading strategy;data monitor device;rule-weight grading strategy;smart grid;state estimation model;statistical property","","0","","48","","2015-07-21","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","0190-3918;01903918","978-1-4244-7918-4;9781424479184","978-0-7695-4157-0;9780769541570","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the high data rate coupled with complex detection can cause the capacity of the fault tolerance system to be exhausted resulting in low detection accuracy. We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857;10609857","0-7695-2995-X;076952995X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET.","","0-7695-2369-2;0769523692","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607590","","Atomic layer deposition;Automatic testing;Emulation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;System testing;Wireless networks","","","","2","","16","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques.

We adapt the EM algorithm to estimate the distribution parameter of Gaussian mixture distribution model. If only there is a statistical signature of unusual fluctuation or change in the network traffic an alarm will be triggered. We adapt the time series analysis of the statistical analysis result. Up bound and low bound will be defined through the analysis. The exceeding of the bound will be the signal of traffic anomaly. Another time series analysis approach also can reflect the fluctuation of network with the crossover of two indicator lines called K line and D line. These two indicator lines are some think like the mean value of the historical data in a time slice with one more sensitive to the change of the new coming data and another not.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination.

In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

Alert correlators use correlation rules (that can be explicit, implicit or semi-explicit [3]) in order to solve this problem by extracting complex relationships between the different generated events and alerts. On the other hand, providing maintainable, complete and accurate correlation rules specifically adapted to an information system is a very difficult work.

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1499-7;1424414997","1-4244-1500-4;1424415004","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results comparing the effectiveness of a multiple classifier IDS with such a labelling strategy and that of the classical cardinality labelling based IDS show that the proposed strategy behaves much better in a heavily attacked environment where massive attacks are present. The parameters of the labelling algorithm can be varied in order to adapt to the conditions in the monitored network.","1530-1605;15301605","0-7695-2507-5;0769525075","","10.1109/HICSS.2006.247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579550","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Data security;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Physics computing","","","","5","","24","","","04-07 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design an intrusion prevention system to realize the source-end defense method. The packets are categorized into three types: normal, suspicious and attack packets. The attack packets are blocked before they enter the Internet. The bandwidth of the suspicious packets is restricted and the IP header is attached with a signature made by their edge router.

In this field, how to improve detection rate is one of key issues. In this paper, the importance of event sequence in time is presented. Then, we discuss three factors, i.e. timestamp precision, time synchronization and network delay, which effect detection rate on the view of event sequence in time. On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true. Accordingly, we address some methods, i.e. raising timestamp precision, active self- adapting time synchronization algorithm and state turnabout mechanism. Experiments indicate that anyone of three measures can elevate detection performance to a certain extent.

However, it is not feasible in the limited resources available in SoC systems.

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods. The paper also presents two case scenarios, particularly highlighting the victim Silent case scenario not discussed much thus far in the current literature on the topic, to validate the results. By way of retrospect, an outline of future work is also suggested in the concluding remarks.","","978-1-4799-1605-4;9781479916054","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2013.6719774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719774","802.11 Wireless LAN;FRR;FRR-RA;MAC address;SNRA;Sequence Gap;Spoofing;false positives / negatives;transmission rate;victim Silent case in WLAN","Authentication;Computer crime;Monitoring;Probes;Protocols;Wireless LAN","access protocols;computer network security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN;MAC spoofing detection techniques;WLAN spoofing detection methods;cyber crimes;cyber criminal;denial of service;masquerading attacks;network identifiers;perpetrator-initiator;potent weapon;session hijacking;victim silent case","","0","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

To prevent the execution of malicious codes on the host, HIDS monitors the system audit and event logs. But the design of HIDS is very challenging due to the presence of high false alarm rate. This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed. The features satisfying the semantic hypothesis are extracted and then normalized. The normalized values are then given as input to the decision engine. The decision engine used is the Extreme Learning Machine - a new type of neural network. Performance was evaluated using the modern ADFA-LD dataset.","","","","10.1109/ISCO.2015.7282244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7282244","ADFA-LD;Anomaly;ELM;HIDS;semantic phrases","Dictionaries;Engines;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Semantics;Support vector machines","database management systems;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","ADFA-LD dataset;HIDS;anomaly based host intrusion detection system;data dictionary;decision engine;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;kernel level system calls;neural network;semantic based system call patterns","","","","11","","","9-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing efficacy of cyber threats continues to highlight the inadequacies of traditional defense mechanism such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection System. The security analyst however focuses on finding the technical deficiency but do not consider the adversaries motivations and their diversity in attacking mechanism. The attackers are not analogous; they differ in their motivations, strategies, devices used and potential. In order to analyze and design security system, it is therefore necessary to consider characteristics that ascertain attack strategy, attacker behavior and threats generated by attackers. The attacker behavioral analysis has proved to be an impulsive aid for threat analysis. A generic model is proposed to model the cyber attacker's behavior more accurately by considering the principles behind the attacker's behavior and thereby generating the profile of an attacker.","","","","10.1109/WCI.2015.7495520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495520","Behavior Analysis;Cyber Attack;Mathematical Model;Profile","Computers;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Operating systems;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circular sequences of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process is replaced by circular body, then, a little data is extracted from normal system call sequences, and is transformed to decisive table, afterward, the decisive table is reduced and the simplest rules that present normal behavior mode is extracted by rough sets theory. These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper. Compared with other methods in the literature, the method presented in this paper is not only able to extract a set of effective detection rules with the minimum size from part of records of system call sequences, but also can detect the known intrusion quickly.

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naive Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively. This sharp increase in detection rate is obtained with less than 3 percent false alarms. The signatures generated by ADS upgrade the SNORT performance by 33 percent.

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3;9781467358323","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","1","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks. In this work, we explore the challenges posed in identifying and developing a set of behavior primitives that facilitate the creation of threat narratives use to describe cyber threats anomalies. Thus, we investigate the use aggregate behaviors derived from network flow data establishing initial behavior models used to detect complex cyber threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important detection that is used as a countermeasure to preserve data integrity and system availability from attacks. Data mining is being used to clean, classify, and examine large amount of network data to correlate common infringement for intrusion detection. The main reason for using data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. The amount of data accumulated each day by a network is huge. Several data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rules are proving to be useful for gathering different knowledge for intrusion detection. This paper presents the idea of applying data mining techniques to intrusion detection systems to maximize the effectiveness in identifying attacks, thereby helping the users to construct more secure information systems.","","0-7803-9093-8;0780390938","","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506525","","Availability;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection","data integrity;data mining;security of data","association rule;data integrity;data mining technique;information security;intrusion detection system;organizational information system;secure information system","","2","1","12","","","15-17 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The third method, referred to as variable-length partition with multiple breakmarks (VPMB), is similar to VPSW except that multiple breakmarks are used.

In this paper, we apply a light-weight watermarking technique to defend against false data injection attacks. To be specific, we add a secure watermark to real-time meter readings and transmit the watermarked data through high speed unsecured network. The utility can then correlate the watermarked data with the original watermark to detect the presence of false data injected by adversary.

The proposed scheme is based on using a wavelet based analysis of the received signal strength. We first develop a model to describe the changes in the received signal strength of a wireless station during a session hijack, while the received signal is embedded in colored noise caused by fading wireless channels. An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges. The detection mechanism is validated using both simulation and experimental results. The detector is shown to be reliable, computationally inexpensive and have minimal impact on the network performance.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.081447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441359","Network security, intrusion detection.","Colored noise;Computational modeling;Fading;Filters;Frequency;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wireless networks","safety systems;telecommunication security;time series;wavelet transforms;wireless channels","fading wireless channels;optimal filter;power spectral density;received signal strength;session hijacks;wavelet based analysis;wavelet transform;wireless networks","","1","","13","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed.

Allowing white spaces to be used in a deregulated manner exposes the radio spectrum to anomalous usage, which in turn may intentionally or unintentionally cause interference to primary users (PUs) as well as secondary users (SUs). In this paper we propose a subspace-based spectrum guarding detector (SSGD) to address the security of unauthorized spectrum usage. In particular, we consider the scenario where ongoing authorized transmissions by PUs have to be preserved from concurrent unauthorized emissions in the same frequency bands. The detector operates in two phases: a training phase where SSGD collects samples of the authorized transmissions, and a detection (on-line) phase where the spectrum is guarded against anomalous emissions. The performance of SSGD is analyzed in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities highlighting the effects of the propagation scenario, the PU characteristics, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the duration of both training and on-line phases. Numerical results show that in practical scenarios SSGD provides a remarkable SNR improvement of several dB over the conventional energy detector (ED).","2164-7038;21647038","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247214","","Cognitive radio;Covariance matrices;Detectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal to noise ratio;Training","cognitive radio;error statistics;next generation networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","PU;SNR improvement;SSGD;anomalous emission;authorized transmission;cognitive radio;concurrent unauthorized emission;dynamic spectrum access;energy detector;false alarm probability;next generation wireless network;phase detection;primary user;secondary user;signal-to-noise ratio;spectrum efficiency;subspace-based spectrum guarding detector;training phase;unauthorized spectrum usage security;white space","","","","26","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPIE system has been proven to work effectively and efficiently for IP version 4, largely because an IPv4 packet has sufficient entropy in the first 28 bytes to allow the hash functions to uniquely identify each packet.
