A simple modification to the wireless MAC protocol is proposed to expose the presence of an adversary conducting a frame-relaying attack.

In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the detection manager to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1;0780381041","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","2159-6182;21596182","978-1-4799-5062-1;9781479950621","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492","","Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads","","","","2","","19","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662;21660662","978-1-4799-3857-5;9781479938575","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","19","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate the problem of distributed collaborative defense against coordinated attacks in MANET as a dynamic game problem. In our formulation we have on the one hand a group of attackers that observe what is going on in the network and coordinate their attack in an adaptive manner. On the other side, we have a group of defending nodes (the IDS nodes) that collaboratively observe the network and coordinate their actions against the attackers. Using extensions of the game theoretic framework of [3] we provide a mathematical framework for efficient identification of the worst attacks and damages that the attackers can achieve, as well as the best response of the defenders.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

The hindrance of such attacks is entirely dependent on their detection. The detection is a major part of any security tool such as intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), adaptive security alliance (ASA), check points and firewalls. Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing.

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Computer security;Data security;Evolutionary computation;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;anomaly detection;evolutionary neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning techniques;program behavior;system-call audit data;system-call sequences","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","16","","25","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an attack flow traceback scheme which is based on flow digests and network layer data. Digesting flow instead of individual packet would save memory and be more scalable.

Understanding the underlying cause is critical for the deployment of effective response measures aimed at restoring the network functionality. Shebaro et al. [9] proposed an initial approach for fine-grained analysis (FGA) of packet losses, and implemented and evaluated a tool based on it. Such approach profiles the wireless links between the nodes using resident metrics, such as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the link quality indicator (LQI) for every packet, in order to achieve an accurate diagnosis of their root causes. The accuracy of their approach relies on the correct choice of some system parameters and thresholds, and empirically-determined values such as those proposed in their work might not always be optimal. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the network administrator, their approach uses a single threshold value set for the entire WSN, which can be suitable for some neighborhoods but not appropriate for others. In this work, we design an approach that builds a statistical model for determining optimal system thresholds by exploiting the variances of RSSI and LQI. Our model also has the advantage of allowing the setting of an individual threshold for each link. We have validated our approach through extensive MATLAB simulations based on real sensor data, showing that our model is accurate and its system parameters lead to an optimally-accurate fine-grained analysis of the underlying causes of packet losses.","","","","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300899","LQI;RSSI;WSN;interference;variance","Interference;Mathematical model;Packet loss;Testing;Wireless sensor networks","RSSI;wireless sensor networks","LQI;RSSI;link quality indicator;optimal system thresholds;packet losses;received signal strength indicator;resident metrics;statistically-enhanced fine-grained diagnosis;wireless links;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes.

Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. Proceedings. IEEE","20021107","2002","3","","1530","1539","We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","87","8","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The heterogeneity of its components imposes a sophisticated security architecture to protect the smart grid from any attack's attempt. In this paper, we propose an architecture in which Intrusion Detection System (IDS) agents are implemented with a distributed manner to monitor the consumer side, building appliances and smart meters. Those IDSs rely on rule-based detection policy, which consists in the combination of temporal and spatial detection rules. Simulation results prove that this combination enhances attack's detection rate and reduces false positive rate.","","","","10.1109/GIIS.2015.7347186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347186","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);rules-based detection;smart grid;smart meter","Delay effects;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Jitter;Monitoring;Smart grids;Smart meters","power distribution;power engineering computing;power transmission;smart meters;smart power grids;telecommunication security","IDS agents;attack detection rate;communication network;distribution units;intrusion detection approach;intrusion detection system agents;lethal attacks;power grid;rule-based detection policy;security architecture;smart grid;smart meters;spatial based detection;temporal based detection;transmission units","","","","6","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, multiple detection engines with multi-layered intrusion detection mechanisms are proposed. The principle is to coordinate the results from each single-engine intrusion alert system, by seamlessly integrating with the multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure. An improved hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for the detection engine which is capable of the immunology-based self/nonself discrimination. The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviour of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process called HPSOWM. Considering a real benchmark dataset from the public domain, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can greatly shorten the training time of HMM and reduce the false positive rate significantly. The proposed HPSOWM especially works for the efficient classification of unknown behaviors and malicious attacks.","","978-1-4673-0768-0;9781467307680","","10.1109/IB2Com.2011.6217920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217920","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Engines;Hidden Markov models;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Training","computer network security;fuzzy reasoning;hidden Markov models;particle swarm optimisation;service-oriented architecture;wavelet transforms","HMM;HPSOWM;advanced fuzzy-based inference process;computer networks;false positive rate;hidden Markov model;hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation approach;immunology-based self-nonself discrimination;large-scale distributed complex network;multilayered intrusion detection mechanisms;multiple detection engines;multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure;nature inspired anomaly detection system;single detection engine based system;single-engine intrusion alert system","","0","","25","","","21-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced.

Honeyfiles can increase a network's internal security without adversely affecting normal operations. The honeyfile system was tested by deploying it on a honeynet, where hackers' use of honeyfiles was observed. The use of honeynets to test a computer security device is also discussed.

In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences.

Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes.

Nevertheless, this has not only exposed NCIs to typical ICT systems attacks, but also to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of Cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer's Theory of Evidence we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches. The proposed ADS is validated in a scenario assessing the consequences of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and the propagation of such disturbances to the operation of a simulated power grid.","2325-6648;23256648","","","10.1109/DSNW.2013.6615505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615505","Anomaly Detection System;DDoS;Data Fusion;MPLS;Networked Critical Infrastructures;SCADA","Feature extraction;Ions;Monitoring;Throughput;Weaving","computer network security;inference mechanisms;multiprotocol label switching;power grids;virtual private networks","ADS;DDoS attack;Dempster-Shafer theory-of-evidence;ICT system attack;MPLS;NCI;VPN;anomaly detection system;cyber-physical anomaly;cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical data fusion;distributed denial-of-service;information and communication technologies;multiprotocol label switching;networked critical infrastructure;power grid;virtual private network","","2","","27","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the number of patterns could range up to thousands, pattern matching consumes not only the storage but also the most of the CPU cycles to execute the complex pattern matching algorithms. Therefore, so far there is no signature based IDS which can work on resource constraint sensor nodes. This paper presents a dynamic coding mechanism, which helps in implementing a distributed signature based IDS (intrusion detection system) in IP-USN (IP based ubiquitous sensor networks). The proposed scheme also allows building of lightweight IDS in terms of storage, messaging and energy consumption, which make it appropriate for resource constrained sensor devices.","","978-1-4244-3923-2;9781424439232","978-1-4244-3924-9;9781424439249","10.1109/INMW.2009.5195973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5195973","IDS;IP-USN","Computer networks;Energy storage;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Medical services;Pattern matching;Payloads;Remote monitoring;Sensor systems;Transport protocols","IP networks;digital signatures;encoding;pattern matching;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","CPU cycles;IP based sensor network;dynamic coding scheme;intrusion detection system;packet header matching;pattern matching;resource constrained sensor device;signature based IDS","","1","","20","","","1-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts. Our experimental results based on wireless behavior profiles from users in the CRAWDAD dataset show that the volume of false alerts generated by cluster-based AD sensors is reduced by at least 50% compared to single-profile AD sensors.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3447-3;9780769534473","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721573","Behavior Profile Clustering;False Alert Reduction;Network-based Anomaly Detection Sensors;Wireless Users","Application software;Collaboration;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Performance analysis;Robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches","security of data","anomalous activity;anomalous behavior identification;anomaly detection sensor;behavior-profile clustering;cluster-based AD sensor;false alert reduction;malicious activity;wireless behavior profile","","2","","16","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of features is produced projecting statistical texture properties of the images, using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs). Edge detection is applied, histograms of images after edge detection are produced and used as second and third set of features with 40 and 30 bins respectively. Eighty percent of examples from each; good and bad category, are used for training purposes and rest are used as test data. Logistic Regression with gradient descent algorithm is used as classifier.

As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","","978-1-4673-7988-5;9781467379885","","10.1109/QRS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272921","Anomaly Detection Systems;Boolean Combination;Intrusion Detection Systems;Multiple-Detector Systems;Pruning Techniques","Accuracy;Boolean functions;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Training","Boolean algebra;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;PBC;anomaly detection system;intrusion detection system;machine learning technique;pruning Boolean combination;pruning technique","","","","44","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this model we try to represent the complex case structural information through class hierarchy. The new method not only overcomes limitations that traditional attribute-value case representation can not represent complex cases, but also combines domain knowledge and case representation through constraint rules. In the aspect of case similarity, we divide it into two categories: the intra- class similarity and the inter-class similarity, which shows more accurate and convenient. The object-oriented case representation has been used in our own IDS product and it plays a quite efficient role in mitigating over-sensitive alarm problems.","","978-0-7695-3641-5;9780769536415","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222879","Case-based Reasoning;Intrusion detection;Object oriented case representation","Application software;Computer languages;Encapsulation;Expert systems;Information science;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Object oriented modeling;Psychology;Security","case-based reasoning;knowledge representation;object-oriented programming;security of data","alarm problem;attribute-value case representation;case based reasoning;class hierarchy;constraint rules;domain knowledge;interclass similarity;intraclass similarity;intrusion detection system;object-oriented case representation;object-oriented model;structural information","","1","","17","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","1","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Audit data taken from MAC level/network level/application level from the traces in Glomosim and are preprocessed separately for each layer's detection subsystem. Feature data sets for each layer are selected from normal transactions. The detection subsystem contains normal profiles obtained from the feature vectors of training data sets. In our work, we used Bayesian classification algorithm, Markov chain construction algorithm and association rule mining algorithm for anomaly detection in MAC layer, routing layer and application layer respectively for effective intrusion detection. Test data obtained from the network traffic is feed in to the detection subsystems. If there is any deviation from normal behavior, it is considered as abnormal or anomaly based on predefined thresholds. Intrusion results from detection subsystems of all the three layers are integrated at local integration module and the final result is sent to the global integration module.

For this reason, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been developed in order to detect and prevent computer network attacks. However, the majority of IDSs operate on huge network traffic data with many useless and redundant features. Consequently, the IDS generates a lot of false alarms and the intrusion detection process becomes difficult and imprecise. To improve the performance of an IDS, many data dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), have been proposed. However, the classical PCA approach, that is based on the covariance matrix of the data, is very sensitive to outliers. In order to overcome this problem, we propose to introduce a new variant of PCA namely L1-norm PCA. This new method is based on the L1-norm maximization, which is more robust to outliers, instead of the Euclidean norm in the classical PCA. Extensive experiments on the well-known KDDcup99 dataset are exploited for testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Obtained results confirm the superiority of L1-norm PCA over the traditional PCA in terms of network attacks detection and false alarms reduction.","","","","10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492755","","Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Probes;Training","computer network security;data reduction;optimisation;principal component analysis","L1-norm PCA;L1-norm maximization;computer network attacks;data dimensionality reduction methods;information and communication technologies;network intrusion detection system;network traffic data;principal component analysis","","","","14","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performance of the classifier is an essential concern in terms of its effectiveness; also number of feature to be examined by the IDS should be improved. In our work, we have proposed two techniques, C4.5 Decision tree algorithm and C4.5 Decision tree with Pruning, using feature selection.
