However, trustworthiness of documents and actors is not explicitly measured, leaving actors unaware of how latest security events may have impacted the trustworthiness of the information being used and the actors involved. This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357562","HTTP;TCP;big data;chat;documents;email;insider threat;machine learning;support vector machine;trust;usage patterns","Access control;Big data;Computer security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Monitoring","Big Data;authorisation;data analysis;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trusted computing","BBAC;English text exchanges;HTTP requests;actor trustworthiness;behavior-based access control;big data analytics;big data batch processing;chat messages;classifier training;clustering analysis;document trustworthiness;emails;enterprise environments;information trustworthiness;insider threat detection;interconnected systems;machine learning;mal-behavior;network connections;real-time stream processing;security events;statistical classification","","","","37","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security of IMS networks has not been fully examined. This paper presents a novel DoS attack against IMS. By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test. Through trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that our defense mechanism can throttle this DoS attack within a short defense time window while generating few false alarms.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062173","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer science;Information analysis;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Resonance light scattering;Signal generators;Subscriptions;Telecommunication traffic","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;security of data","3G networks;IMS networks;IP multimedia subsystem;chain reaction DoS attack;chained automatic reaction;change-point detection;defense time window;malicious attack;malicious clients;multimedia services;non-parametric GRSh test;online early defense mechanism","","8","","30","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key problem is how to minimize the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network when identifying misbehaviors. Our approach to this problem is based on a distributed, cluster-based anomaly detection algorithm. We minimize the communication overhead by clustering the sensor measurements and merging clusters before sending a description of the clusters to the other nodes. In order to evaluate our distributed scheme, we implemented our algorithm in a simulation based on the sensor data gathered from the Great Duck Island project.

The main property we have considered for each behavior is the correlation between the parameters of it. We compute a correlation matrix for normal sessions in the training phase. Then we select effective security parameters for our detection engine using an equivalent class with a graphical illustration namely correlation relation graph (CRG). These extracted parameters among all parameters of each normal behavior have a relation with each other which could be computed by regression relations. Each behavior has some pairs of selected parameters including the independent parameter and the dependent one. As an inline detection process, we look at the value of selected parameters of each current session and put them into their computed regression relation. If the computed value of the dependent parameter of each pair has a value greater then what we compute by their regression relation, it will be considered as a deviation. Number of deviations per session and the combination of them is used to label a session as normal or attack.

This allows us to focus on abnormal changes in network traffic behavior. We test our approach on the Network Intrusion Dataset provided by the Information Exploration Shootout (IES) project and the 1999 DARPA Intrusion detection Evaluation Dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab.

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257","Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort","Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses","invasive software","EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware","","0","","36","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we design a spectrum scanning protocol that incorporates knowledge about the scanning effectiveness across different bands, which can increase scanning efficiency. The adversary, however, can also exploit such knowledge to its advantage. To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats. Finally, we show that the strategy might be sensitive to prior knowledge, which can be corrected by adapted learning.","1520-6149;15206149","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178269","Bayesian game;Spectrum scanning;intrusion detection system","Bandwidth;Bayes methods;Games;Interference;Intrusion detection;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","Bayes methods;access protocols;radio spectrum management;security of data","Bayesian model;dynamic spectrum access scenarios;equal threat;intrusion detection system;less-protected bands;malicious activity spectrum;malicious user detection;scanner capability;scanning allocation dilemma;scanning effectiveness;spectrum scanning protocol","","0","","20","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder.

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection.

Developing adaptive and flexible oriented IDSs remains a challenging and demanding task due to the incessantly appearance of new types of attacks and sabotaging approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised statistical approach for detecting network based attacks. In our approach, patterns of normal and intrusive activities are learned through finite generalized Dirichlet mixture models, in the context of Bayesian variational inference.

To accommodate this increase in application and data complexity, web services have moved to a multitiered design wherein the webserver runs the application front-end logic and data are outsourced to a database or file server. In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a distributed scheme that can mitigate the damage caused by DDoS through a coordinated detection and response framework. This proposed scheme composes of a number of heterogeneous defense systems which cooperate with each other in protecting Internet servers. We have set up a network testbed for carrying out extensive experiments using real server machines, routers and software attack tools. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme can greatly improve the throughput of legitimate traffic and reduce the attack traffic during DDoS attacks.

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion. For GA, the probability of crossover will be enhanced by applying fuzzy logic.

Even though in most cases these techniques are effective enough, this paper describes how instead they can be detected using properly configured IDSs. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach named polymorphic blending exfiltration that serves to avoid detection from signature-based as well as anomaly-based IDSs. This technique permits to blend the exfiltrated data in the normal and legitimate traffic. We show how IDSs can be easily improved in order to be able to detect such exfiltration.

In this paper, we propose a weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection method that can effectively identify abnormal behavior such as mobility patterns of mobile wireless networks. In the proposed algorithm, a normal profile is constructed from normal mobility patterns of mobile nodes in mobile wireless networks. From the constructed normal profile, the dissimilarity is computed by a weighted dissimilarity measure. If the computed dissimilarity value is greater than the dissimilarity threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message is occurred. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. From the result of the simulation, we know that the proposed method is superior to the performance of anomaly detection methods using other dissimilarity measures.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283011","Anomaly Detection;Dissimilarity Measures;Mobile Wireless Networks;Mobility Pattern","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Pollution measurement;Weight measurement;Wireless networks","mobile radio;telecommunication security","mobile wireless network;mobility pattern;network identity theft;network intrusion;weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection","","0","","8","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many research works were conducted to improve IDS's accuracy by reducing the rate of false alerts and eliminating outliers. In this paper, we propose a three-stage process to detect false alerts and outliers. In the first stage, we cluster the set of elementary alerts to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove outliers from the set of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the last stage, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify meta-alerts either as false alerts or real attacks.

Intrusion detection system must analyze a large volume of data while not placing a significant added load on the monitoring systems and networks. The deficiency of centralized intrusion detection systems leads the idea of mobile agents. In an agent based IDS idea, there is no central station, therefore no central point of failure. Agents can detect and take predefined actions against malicious activity. The system shows a superior performance compared to central sniffing IDS techniques, and saves network resources compared to other distributed IDSs that activate too many sniffers causing bottlenecks in the network.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined.

A new network anomaly detection method has been proposed in this paper. The main idea of the method is network traffic is analyzed and estimated by using Relative Entropy Theory (RET), and a network anomaly detection model based on RET is designed as well. The numerical value of relative entropy is used to alleviate the inherent contradictions between improving detection rate and reducing false alarm rate, which is more precise and can effectively reduce the error of estimation.

The main problems of these systems, however, are the many false alarms they produce, their lack of resistance to both malicious attacks and accidental failures, and the constant appearance of new attacks and vulnerabilities. IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines.

Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution. The experimental results on KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark data demonstrate that applying ACCM with one of the feature extraction algorithms is effective to detect known or unseen intrusion attacks with high detection rate and recognize normal network traffic with low false positive rate","","0-7803-9484-4;0780394844","","10.1109/ICIT.2005.1600609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1600609","Clustering;Feature extraction;Industrial network security;Intrusion detection;Swarm intelligence","Biological system modeling;Clustering algorithms;Computer network management;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Feature extraction;Industrial control;Intrusion detection;Networked control systems;Protection","decentralised control;feature extraction;industrial control;industrial plants;multi-agent systems;optimisation;pattern clustering;safety systems","KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark;ant colony clustering approach;decentralized intrusion detection;decentralized management;industrial control systems;industrial network;industrial plants;large switched networks;multiagent intrusion detection system;network attacks;networked control systems;normal network traffic;optimization principles;prevention control;security protection;swarm intelligence;unsupervised feature extraction;unsupervised feature extraction algorithms","","14","","5","","","14-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7;9781424491537","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the speed of data packet capture and analysis doesn't match the network application, which causes a general problem in IDS and the ratio of data packet lost is quite high. Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system. As network speed and capacity is growing rapid, it is necessary to improve the algorithm of pattern matching to follow the currency.

Unlike other statistical anomaly detection methods such as nearest neighbor approach, K-means clustering or probabilistic analysis that employ distance computation in the feature space to identify the outliers, our approach does not involve costly point-to-point computation in organizing the data into clusters. Another advantage is the reduced network size. We use the classification capability of the K-Map on selected dimensions of data set in detecting anomalies. Randomly selected subsets that contain both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark data are used to train the hierarchical net. We use a confidence measure to label the clusters. Then we use the test set from the same KDD Cup 1999 benchmark to test the hierarchical net.

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3;9781424469383","978-1-4244-6939-0;9781424469390","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

Statistical techniques, evolutionary techniques, and data mining techniques have also been used for this purpose. In this paper, we use a centroid-based technique for network intrusion detection in which the centroid is constructed on the basis of diversity. Diversity of a point is the sum of the distances from a point to all other points in a cluster. The point having minimum diversity is chosen as a centroid. The performance of diversity-based centroid shows significant improvement in the classification of intrusions.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces noise due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","18","7","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, each dataset is characterized by a large set of features, but not all features will be relevant or fully contribute identifying an attack. Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack. The proposed method is based on MAHALANOBIS Distance feature ranking and an improved exhaustive search to choose a better combination of features. We evaluate the approach on the KDD CUP 1999 datasets using SVM classifier and KNN classifier. The results show that classification is done with high classification rate and low misclassification rate with the reduced feature subsets.","","978-1-4673-6452-2;9781467364522","","10.1109/SNS-PCS.2013.6553837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553837","Feature Selection;KNN;MAHALANOBIS Distance;SVM;classification;intrusion detection","Feature extraction;Industries;Kernel;Optimized production technology;Support vector machines;Virtual private networks","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security","K-nearest neighbor;KDD CUP 1999 datasets;KNN classifier;MAHALANOBIS distance feature ranking;NIDS;SVM classifier;detection accuracy;exhaustive search;feature selection algorithm;network audit data;network intrusion detection system;network security;support vector machines","","0","","14","","","18-19 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of generating large number of rules the evolution optimization techniques like Genetic Network Programming (GNP) can be used. The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon. We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes. Our proposal follows an Apriori algorithm based fuzzy WAR and GNP and avoids pre and post processing thus eliminating the extra steps during rules generation.

This paper proposes a real-time distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for the AMI infrastructure that utilizes stream data mining techniques and a multi-layer implementation approach.

In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society","20030923","2003","","","53","59","We investigate the statistical anomaly detection of DOS computer network attacks using only MIB II supplied traffic parameters of the SNMP, as carried out by MAID. MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a <sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","30","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised.

Detecting faults and attacks is essential to ensure the correct semantic of the network, while distinguishing faults from attacks is necessary to initiate a correct recovery action. The approach uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the error/attack-free dynamics of the environment and the dynamics of error/attack data.

This paper presents an innovative approach that coordinates distributed network traffic Monitors and attack Correlators supported by Open Virtual Switches (OVS). The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms.

AMETHYST analyses picture sequences from before and after an alarm instead of continuously analysing live video. Sequences are provided by a Loop Framestore, either connected to or part of the AMETHYST system. The algorithms will be assessed and developed using PSDB's growing collection of over 150 alarm sequences","0885-8985;08858985","","","10.1109/62.690863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=690863","","Authentication;Contracts;Event detection;Filters;Hardware;Humans;Intrusion detection;Motion detection;Prototypes;Software prototyping","alarm systems;computer vision;safety systems","AMETHYST;Loop Framestore;PIDS alarms;Perimeter Intrusion Detection System;Video Motion Detection;automatic alarm assessment;automatic assessment algorithms;eight channel prototype;hardware;perimeter detection;single channel AMETHYST demonstrator;software","","2","","2","","","Jul 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
