It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.","","978-1-4244-3782-5;9781424437825","978-4-9904-2590-6;9784990425906","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045945","Command sequence;Customized grammar;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Masquerade detection;N-gram;Self signature;Uniqueness;Unix","Application software;Computer applications;Computer industry;Data security;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines","Unix;authorisation;grammars;statistical analysis","Greenberg data;IDS;Schonlau data;Unix command sequence;anomaly detection;command frequency;command sequence grammar;customized grammars;firewall;masquerade detection;misuse-based intrusion detection;self signature approach;statistical methods","","1","","18","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead. We have developed a prototype that was evaluated in AODV-enabled networks using the ns-2 network simulator.","","0-7695-2342-0;0769523420","","10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443525","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Data security;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;knowledge based systems;minimisation;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","knowledge-based techniques;minimisation;mobile ad hoc networks;network topologies;real-time intrusion detection;secure routing protocol","","12","","14","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9;9781467319119","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Denial-of-service attacks have been successful in denying legitimate traffic access to its required resources because existing routing protocols treat the attacking traffic equally as any normal traffic. This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic. We demonstrate through several examples, how our approach can dynamically detect attacks, quantify their impact, and how to reduce the impacts and recover from them.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514527","Abnormality distance (AD);network attack;proactive defense;quality-of-protection (QoP)","Computer crime;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;Internet;authorisation;fault diagnosis;monitoring;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AD metric;Internet infrastructure;QoP;QoS protocol;abnormality distance;automatic technique;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;network fault;network traffic flow;online monitoring;proactive defense network;quality-of-protection;quality-of-service;routing protocol;self-protection mechanism","","8","1","59","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets.

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition. As a result, energy consumption data of servers must be protected carefully, as it is potentially valuable information for an attacker trying to track down a VM to mount further attack steps.","","978-1-4673-0006-3;9781467300063","","10.1109/DASC.2011.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119058","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;VM;cloud computing;data centers;energy consumption side channel attack;energy efficiency;energy/power consumption;hardware platform;power measurement device;power monitored server;virtual machines","","6","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls.

Virtualization and multi-tenancy provide a number of advantages for increasing resource utilization and for providing on demand elasticity. However, these cloud features also raise many security concerns related to cloud computing resources. In this paper, we propose an architecture and approach for leveraging the virtualization technology at the core of cloud computing to perform intrusion detection security using hypervisor performance metrics. Through the use of virtual machine performance metrics gathered from hypervisors, such as packets transmitted/received, block device read/write requests, and CPU utilization, we demonstrate and verify that suspicious activities can be profiled without detailed knowledge of the operating system running within the virtual machines. The proposed hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system does not require additional software installed in virtual machines and has many advantages compared to host-based and network based intrusion detection systems which can complement these traditional approaches to intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785472","Cloud Computing;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security;software architecture;software metrics;virtual machines;virtualisation","CPU utilization;block device read requests;block device write requests;cloud computing resources;cloud features;hypervisor performance metrics;hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system;intrusion detection security;multitenancy;operating system;packet transmission;received packets;shared resource utilization;virtual machine performance metrics;virtualization;virtualization technology","","2","","16","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

A new approach to register anomaly detection (RAD) is proposed in the meaning of model generator and anomaly detector.

The results show that S4VM has high accuracy when a large proportion of data is unlabelled.

Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort).

An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results.

A network has multiple tasks, which consist of multiple network services aiding the execution of a task. An emerging track of security research has focused on event prioritization and correlation to rank the criticality of events and reduce the number of low-level events. To prioritize and correlate events, the ongoing tasks in an enterprise network are identified, as the goal of network operators is to protect ongoing tasks when a security breach occurs. The prioritization of an event depends on the criticality of an ongoing task that is potentially threatened by the event. Additionally, in order to support network operators, we correlate all events that target the same task. A particular task may depend on multiple network services and involve multiple network devices. So, if one network service becomes unavailable, other network services will be affected over time since they Unfortunately, dependency details are often not documented and are difficult to discover by relying on human expert knowledge. In order to solve this problem, a network dependency analysis based on network traffic is conducted. We rely on pattern mining techniques to discover tasks in a monitored enterprise network.

There are innumerous commercial home intrusion detection systems readily available in the market, all of which tend to be expensive to install and include contracts with monthly recurring payments. Moreover, these systems have high false alarm rates and unnecessary calls to 911 operators. The novelty of our present implementation design lies in cost and time effective communication of the intrusion event wirelessly to the home-owners and law-enforcement with a confirmed image of the scene during the intrusion event.

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, new history based routing schemes e.g. Prophet have been proposed because traditional adhoc routing schemes do not work well in sparse ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks that use Prophet as their routing scheme. Via simulations, we study the effectiveness of the FBIDM scheme when malicious nodes launch selective data dropping attacks.

Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information.

The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance. Our main result is the modeling of user activity on a computing system as a martingale and the subsequent quantification of the cost of performing a job to enable decision making","1060-9857;10609857","0-7695-1366-2;0769513662","","10.1109/RELDIS.2001.969760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=969760","","Costs;Delay;Encapsulation;Fault detection;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal resolution;Wide area networks;Yarn","computer network management;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;safety systems;system recovery","active response;analytical framework;cost analysis;critical infrastructure protection;decision making;error detection;intrusion detection solutions;intrusion signaling;martingale;network information assurance analysts;real-time assessment scheme;reasoning framework;recovery thread;system activities;user activity modeling","","5","","15","","","2001","28 Oct 2001-31 Oct 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA.

Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme in a distributed network environment and evaluated the performance of our scheme compared with Snort.

"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Nong Ye; Yebin Zhang; C. M. Borror","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","20040405","2004","53","1","116","123","Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","41","3","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations.

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","13","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. In this paper, we have implemented I-Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and I- PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm to detect time interval denial of service (DoS) attack sequences on network traffic data of KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners.

The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives. This is caused by the unstable nature of the wireless medium and also because of the difficulty to model the behaviour of the diverse implementations from different manufacturers. One way to reduce false positives is to combine different techniques to carry out the analysis. We propose a novel method that identifies the impersonation of certain management frames, which helps to reduce the number of false positives within other existing MAC spoofing detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529384","802.11 MAC address spoofing;false positive","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Personal digital assistants;Protocols","access protocols;computational complexity;message authentication;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 network;beacon MAC frame spoofing attack detection;management frame authentication;protocol","","1","","26","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The shared feature set consisted of features agreed by the two feature selection algorithms and therefore considered important features for identifying intrusions. Human intervention was then conducted to find an optimal number of features in between the combined (maximum) and shared feature sets (minimum).

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly.

The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period.

Considering the large overhead of existing methods to construct normal profile using system call traces, an efficient algorithm is proposed based on STIDE in order to reduce the computing cost. The axis system calls which could represent the characteristics of normal behaviors are extracted by a sequences extracting factor. The improved algorithm measures the interestingness of sequences of system calls by involving the axis system calls, then train and tests the relevant sequences which we are concerned about. Experimental results demonstrate that the computing cost of training and testing in the new way has a reduction of 70% than the standard algorithm.","2160-7443;21607443","978-0-7695-3634-7;9780769536347","","10.1109/ICIC.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169560","IDS;anomaly detection;system call","Costs;Data mining;Databases;Delay effects;Fuzzy neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;System testing","security of data","anomaly detection;data resource;intrusion detection system;system call trace sequence","","1","","9","","","21-22 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often the land surrounding a high consequence facility is remote and difficult to sensor with conventional long-range detection systems. In order to combat this difficult problem, Sandia has investigated, developed, and fielded a wireless sensor network that demonstrated the value of providing advanced information of adversary activities. The project used wireless technologies to detect and assess intruders in remote 'un-engineered' terrain around a fixed facility. In the time since the wireless intrusion detection system was fielded, minimal time has been spent on maintenance and no batteries required replacement. Sandia's wireless sensor network provides advanced warning of intruder activities and its installation will improve the security posture of a facility","1071-6572;10716572","1-4244-0174-7;1424401747","","10.1109/CCST.2006.313459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105346","Physical Security;Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS);Wireless Sensor Networks","Communication system security;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Remote monitoring;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","facility location;security;wireless sensor networks","physical protection system;unattended ground sensors;virtual perimeter security;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network","","0","","3","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Symposium on","20090202","2008","","","441","447","In the last few years, the number and impact of security attacks over the Internet have been continuously increasing. To face this issue, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering a novel statistical technique for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different families of Markovian models (namely high order and non homogeneous Markov chains) for modeling network traffic running over TCP. The performance results shown in the paper, justify the proposed method and highlight the improvements over commonly used statistical techniques.","","978-1-56555-320-0;9781565553200","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4667596","High Order Markov Chain;Intrusion Detection System;Mixture Transition Model;Non-Homogeneous Markov Chain;statistical techniques.","Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Face detection;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet;Markov chains;Markovian models;TCP;intrusion detection systems;network anomaly detection;network security;network traffic;security attacks","","0","","11","","","16-18 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
