In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network.

Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm.

We propose a novel architecture to identify users of encrypted traffic in a network environment of a company. It is based on statistical evaluation of monitored network packets.

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation. We develop a fast, memory efficient algorithm for solving this problem as a variant of the longest common subsequence problem.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a gray box since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8;9781424438358","978-0-7695-3816-7;9780769538167","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","2","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6;0780397886","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4;9781467300254","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Twenty-Third Annual","20080102","2007","","","97","106","Various attacks (e.g., SQL injections) may corrupt data items in the database systems, which decreases the integrity level of the database. Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a unsafe zone to isolate user's SQL queries from a safe zone of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases. Our techniques can be applied to database systems to provide multizone isolations with different levels of QoS.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3060-4;9780769530604","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412980","","Application software;Computer science;Computer security;Database systems;Delay;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","SQL;data integrity;quality of service;query processing;security of data;transaction processing","SQL injections;SQL queries;data corruption attacks;database filtering;database isolation;database system transactions;integrity level;intrusion detections systems;quality of service;recovery cost reduction;sequential analysis;uniform processing latency;unsafe zone","","1","","18","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate existed methods of traffic detection represented mostly by IDS system and discover new indicators that can be utilized for improving botnet traffic detection. To do this we analyse the most prevalent backdoors communication protocols that stay behind of the popular botnets. As a result, we extracted new data that might be used in detection routines of IDS (Intrusion Detection System). An objective of the study is mining new indicators of compromise from botnet traffic and using them to identify cyber-attacks on IC.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8;9781424410248","978-1-4244-1025-5;9781424410255","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;game theory-based energy-theft detection;security vulnerabilities;smart grid proliferation;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;utility companies","","9","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

But many of them are not sufficient and effective. Most intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or its efficiency, but it fails to address the security issues. Some of the nodes may be selfish, for example, by not forwarding the packets to the destination, thereby saving the battery power. Some others may act malicious by launching security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. This paper incorporates agents and data mining techniques to prevent anomaly intrusion in mobile adhoc networks. Innuendo, presenting an anomaly detection system comprises of detection modules for detecting anomalies in each layer. Home agents present in each system collects the data from its own system and using data mining techniques to observed the local anomalies. The Mobile agents monitoring the neighboring nodes and collect the information from neighboring home agents to determine the correlation among the observed anomalous patterns before it will send the data.

For intrusion detection method based support vector machine (SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it's impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance. So it is worth applying and popularizing.","","978-1-4244-3835-8;9781424438358","978-0-7695-3816-7;9780769538167","10.1109/AICI.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375980","extension clustering;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Delay;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","security of data;support vector machines","extension clustering support vector machine;intrusion detection algorithm;response time","","0","","13","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies.

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple Intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement in comparison to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-2414-6;9781424424146","978-1-4244-2415-3;9781424424153","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565049","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","Data analysis;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Service oriented architecture;Social network services","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","advanced sensor fusion technique;data-dependent decision fusion;enhanced intrusion detection;neural network supervised learner unit","","3","","28","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","4","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Each node in the model's decision tree was designed to hold a randomized coefficient for the data, so that this coefficient multiplied by the data would yield a weight for the certainty of whether a certain record was an attack or not. The coefficients were based on ephemeral random constants (ERC), random numbers generated by the GA specific to mathematical modeling.","0840-7789;08407789","0-7803-8253-6;0780382536","","10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1349741","","Application software;Computer displays;Computer science;Computer security;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Training data;Watches","authorisation;computer network management;decision support systems;decision trees;genetic algorithms;random number generation","GA;active detection;automated response support;certainty weight;data analysis;decision support module;decision tree;ephemeral random constants;genetic algorithm;mathematical modeling;network intrusion detection;random number generation;randomized coefficient;real-world performance;training data","","0","","20","","","2-5 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a scheme using association algorithm and clustering algorithm is proposed for routing anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks. The scheme uses the Apriori algorithm to extract traffic patterns from both routing table and network traffic packets and subsequently the K-means cluster algorithm adaptively generates a detection model. Through the combination of these two algorithms, routing attacks can be detected effectively and automatically. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is able to detect new attacks that have not previously been seen Moreover, the proposed detection scheme is based on no priori knowledge and then can be applied to a wide range of different sensor networks for a variety of routing attacks.","","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469386","anomaly detection;data-mining;routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;feature extraction;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Apriori algorithm;anomaly detection;association algorithm;clustering algorithm;data-mining;traffic pattern extraction;wireless routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge is that one cannot predict the attack mechanism that will cause the modified behavior or when and how the target's behavior will diverge. Thus, if one restricts one's sensors to a particular aspect of the system or looks for specific malicious behavior, one is likely to miss the attack. This paper describes an approach for simultaneously examining multiple network and host abstraction layers to discover anomalous behavior and then correlating anomalies to determine whether an attack is taking place and, when applicable, select an automatic response. We have used this approach to implement host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems, HIDAR and NIDAR, for enterprise networks, as well as sister systems for tactical networks.

It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems.

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate.

Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them.

The architecture uses the DoD's Architecture Framework guidelines. It employs a multi-sensor approach, including ground surveillance radars and cameras, to detect, assess and track perimeter incursions. It is designed to operate 24/7 in all weather conditions. A command and control center provides timely and accurate situational awareness to facility security personnel responsible for monitoring and managing incidents. Mobile communications also provide situational awareness to first responders in the field. The architecture supports integration with existing security systems, such as access control and closed circuit television, to centralize security monitoring for the entire facility. This architecture is the basis for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Perimeter Intrusion Detection System for four airports, including John F. Kennedy International. Raytheon's system engineering process as applied to the perimeter security application is described, with focus on the key early process phases of threat analysis, operational concept generation, system requirements analysis, and system architecture and design development.

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature.

Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game.

Attack detection techniques can be broadly classified as being signature-based, classification-based, or anomaly-based. In this paper we present a multi level intrusion detection system (ML-IDS) that uses autonomic computing to automate the control and management of ML-IDS. This automation allows ML-IDS to detect network attacks and proactively protect against them. ML-IDS inspects and analyzes network traffic using three levels of granularities (traffic flow, packet header, and payload), and employs an efficient fusion decision algorithm to improve the overall detection rate and minimize the occurrence of false alarms. We have individually evaluated each of our approaches against a wide range of network attacks, and then compared the results of these approaches with the results of the combined decision fusion algorithm.","","978-0-7695-3175-5;9780769531755","978-0-7695-3175-5;9780769531755","10.1109/ICAC.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550834","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Automatic control;Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","anomaly-based attack;attack detection;autonomic computing;classification-based attack;false alarm;fusion decision;multilevel intrusion detection system;network attacks;network traffic;packet header;payload traffic;signature-based attack;traffic flow","","8","","42","","","2-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method as throughput of the network does not deteriorate in presence of the back holes.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296067","AODV;Ad-hoc network;Black Hole Attack;Malicious node;Secured Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;autonomous terminal;black hole problem prevention;centralized management;centralized monitoring;dynamic network topology;infrastructure-based wireless network;malicious node detection;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile devices;open medium;promiscuous mode;security attacks;wired network","","12","","21","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","8","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evaluating network intrusion detection systems research efforts, KDD98, KDDCUP99 and NSLKDD benchmark data sets were generated a decade ago. However, numerous current studies showed that for the current network threat environment, these data sets do not inclusively reflect network traffic and modern low footprint attacks.

Thus, there is no guarantee that a routed communication path is free of malicious nodes that will not comply with the employed protocol and attempt to interfere the network operations. In this paper, we survey the problem of secure routing in ad hoc wireless networks, and discuss the related techniques of cryptographic key distribution. However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access. The extensions of the solutions to address the problem in more general scenarios are also discussed.","","0-7803-8140-8;0780381408","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290203","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;queueing theory;routing protocols;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;concrete queueing model;cryptographic key distribution;intrusion detection problem;medium access;secure routing protocols;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","26","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, to improve the current mitigation solution, this study intents to proposethe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the mitigation rules approach to mitigate the ICMP attack. The mitigation rules are developed specifically to mitigate the ICMP attack and to suppress the number of false alarms. Project implementation is done using Snort, which is installed in the Linux platform. For evaluation purpose, testing is carried out with live private data in identical environment, with the default rules and the proposed mitigation rules enabled in the same LAN.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2;9781424499052","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system.

This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey, we present a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature. We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers.

The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where traditional anomaly detection system is used.","","978-1-4244-5204-0;9781424452040","978-1-4244-5206-4;9781424452064","10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361127","Anomaly detection;Computer security;Contiguous expert voting algorithm;Data mining","Association rules;Computer security;Costs;Data mining;Face detection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Voting","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection system;contiguous expert voting algorithm;data mining;machine learning;malicious intrusion","","1","","12","","","23-25 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers in the field of network security and system survivability have been developing mechanisms to detect DoS attacks. By doing so they hope to maximize accurate detections (true-positive) and minimize non-justified detections (false-positive). This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan. Results show that our method can identify all occurrences and all hosts associated with attack activities, with a low percentage of false positive.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-1229-7;9781424412297","978-1-4244-1230-3;9781424412303","10.1109/ICON.2007.4444065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444065","","Availability;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","DoS attack;Internet;denial of service;lightweight detection;network security;system survivability","","4","","19","","","19-21 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, a new packet filter schema based on multilevel signature and DFA grouping is proposed. In particular, an algorithm called DFA pseudo-split is presented in our proposal to overcome the shortage of signatures. The experimental results show that our proposal significantly outperforms the traditional filter schemas.","","978-1-4799-7433-7;9781479974337","","10.1109/CIS.2014.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7016968","DFA signature;Deep Packet Inspection;Intrusion Detection System;Packet Filter System","Algorithm design and analysis;Educational institutions;Filtering algorithms;Hardware;Inspection;Security;Silicon","cryptography;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","DFA grouping;DFA matching;DFA pseudosplit;REGEXP;REGular EXPressions;deep packet inspection system;high speed match engine;intrusion detection system;matching speed;memory footprint;multilevel signature hash;network security;packet filter schema;single-level signature hash;traffic monitoring","","0","","14","","","15-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular the case of masquerader is treated. This kind of intrusion is one of the more difficult to discover because it may attack already open user sessions. Moreover, this problem is complex because of the large variability of user models and the lack of available data for the learning purpose. Here, flexible and robust similarity measures, suitable also for non-numeric data, are defined, they will be incorporated on a one-class training K N N and compared with several classification methods proposed in the literature using the Masquerading User Data set (www.schonlau.net) representing users and intruders on an UNIX system.","1051-4651;10514651","978-1-4244-2174-9;9781424421749","","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4761050","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Control systems;Face detection;Face recognition;Information systems;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Robustness;State estimation","information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","K-nearest neighborhood classifier;information system;intruder pattern identification;learning approach;masquerading intrusion detection system;one-class training;open user session;similarity measure","","0","","11","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
