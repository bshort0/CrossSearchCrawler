Many of the existing approaches either are rigid, inflexible designs tailored to a specific situation or require manual setting of design parameters such as the initial number of clusters. In this paper we allow the design parameters to be determined dynamically by adopting a layered hybrid architecture, hence resolving the aforementioned shortcomings. The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable. MicroTrack complies with radio regulatory requirements for low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors in the HF band.","","0-7803-7436-3;0780374363","","10.1109/CCST.2002.1049250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049250","","Acoustic pulses;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Coaxial cables;Hafnium;Leak detection;Microwave sensors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ultra wideband radar","CW radar;access control;coaxial cables;fast Fourier transforms;radar applications;radar signal processing;sensors","FM CW radar techniques;Intrepid MicroTrack leaky coaxial cable sensor;barrier mounted applications;buried applications;digital processing components;fast Fourier transform;high speed high resolution analog to digital converters;intruder detection;intruder location;low cost direct digital synthesis chips;low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors;precise target location;radio regulatory requirements;surface applications;swept frequency response translation;ultra wide band HF terrain following radar","","4","2","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data.

In this paper we propose an IDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection combined with the SVM classifier.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the method with a false alarm rate as low as 0.001%.","","978-1-4244-5879-0;9781424458790","","10.1109/ARES.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438076","","Application software;Availability;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;statistical analysis","anomaly intrusion detection;anomaly score;higher order n-grams;layered n-gram version;network packet payload data;statistical methods","","2","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new intrusion detection method by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is proposed. PNN divides inputs into two groups, normal and abnormal. Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time.

This new approach, based on the Cellular Automata classifier (CAC) with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to classify program behavior as normal or intrusive. Parameters and evolution process for CAC with GA are discussed in detail. This implementation considers both temporal and spatial information of network connections in encoding the network connection information into rules in NIDS.

Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect.

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","978-1-4244-2282-1;9781424422821","978-1-4244-2283-8;9781424422838","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","1","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This passive line sensor detects disturbances to commercial FM radio signals caused by an intruder moving in proximity to an open transmission line relative to the same radio signal received on a central reference antenna. The product utilizes a totally new type open transmission line and associated signal processing technique so as to determine the location of the intruder along the sensor line and to permit the use of exactly the same cable structure along the entire cable length. This new open transmission line was designed to be used buried beneath a surface, laying on a surface or suspended in air. By simultaneously processing signals from two or more FM stations the RadioGuard product provides redundancy in case of station failure as well as improved performance due to frequency diversity. The general principles of synergistic radar, the design of the open transmission line, and the specific signal processing techniques used in RadioGuard are described.

So, the detection templates should be modified online, and a template-adjustable adaptive decision fusion algorithm is proposed. There are two benefits in the TAIDS. First, when it is difficult to distinguish current behaviors depending on familiar features, The TAIDS will discriminate them by means of danger theory, making false alarms reduced and the ability of identifying novel attacks enhanced. Second, the adaptive decision templates algorithm allows detection templates to modify dynamically without periodical updating.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process. For verifying the detection accuracy of our classifier, User to Root and Remote to Local attacks of DARPA KDD99 Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set were used.

In order to continue their malevolent activities without being detected, cyber criminals make efforts to conceal the core servers (e.g., C&C servers, exploit servers, and drop-zone servers) in the malicious web infrastructure. Such deliberate invisibility of those concealed malicious servers, however, makes them particularly distinguishable from benign web servers that are usually promoted to be public. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study to investigate the visibility of both malicious and benign servers. From our intensive analysis of over 100,000 benign servers, 45,000 malicious servers and 40,000 redirections, we identify a set of distinct features of malicious web infrastructures from their locations, structures, roles, and relationships perspectives, and propose a lightweight yet effective detection system called VisHunter. VisHunter identifies malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures. We evaluate VisHunter on both online public data and large-scale enterprise network traffic, and demonstrate that VisHunter can achieve an average 96.2% detection rate with only 0.9% false positive rate on the real enterprise network traffic.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524582","","Feature extraction;Indexes;Malware;Search engines;Superluminescent diodes;Web servers","","","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels. We show that Gestalt is robust and effective in detecting polymorphic, stealthy variants of known attacks.","","978-1-4244-5850-9;9781424458509","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541822","Anomaly detection;attack accessment;behavioral analysis;finite state machine;netwrok service","Automata;Computer science;Face detection;Information management;Information science;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","23","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks.

In WSNs, the sensor nodes are deployed in open and unprotected region. So, the sensor networks are vulnerable to a wide class of attacks such as sinkhole, wormhole and Sybil attack. In many-to-one communication the adversary attracts its surrounding neighbor nodes with false routing information and fake identities. The existing researches have focused on single layer attacks. In their work they target only one specific layer and detect the attack, without considering other layers into account. Our proposed detection technique maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross layer features and Mobile agent based approach in two phases. In first phase, attacks are detected by correlating the cross layer features such as MAC and Network layers. During second phase, if the attacks are detected, mobile agent based technique is applied to prevent the attack. Here the data is forwarded through the mobile agent. The mobile agent solves the security problem by using three step negotiations. Through this mobile agent based approach, the false positive rate can be reduced and improving the energy efficiency than the existing approach.","","","","10.1109/ICICES.2016.7518935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518935","Cross layer;Mobile agent;Security;Sinkhole attack;Sybil attack","Base stations;Cross layer design;Feature extraction;Mobile agents;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","25-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

Combined with a template-adjustable decision templates fusion algorithm, a three-level-module adaptive intrusion detection system (TAIDS) is presented. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this MPIN detector and TAIDS.

Our approach employs a heuristic approach to detect return address and filter mass innocent network flows, and then constructs a Markov model to detect the existence and location of executable codes in suspicious flows.

These attacks aim to gain ineligible access to users' accounts by trying plenty of different password combinations. The detection of this type of attack at the network level can overcome the scalability issue of host-based detection methods. In this paper, we provide a machine learning approach for the detection of SSH brute force attacks at the network level. Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models. Our results show that the models built upon these features provide excellent performances for the detection of brute force attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424322","Aggregated Netflows;Brute Force;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Force;Intrusion detection","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","Netflow data;Netflow feature;SSH brute force attack traffic;SSH failed login data;SSH traffic;aggregated netflow data;campus network;computer network;discern brute force traffic;extracting discriminative feature;failed login traffic;host-based detection method;inspection;legitimate user;machine learning approach;machine learning model;machine learning task;network level;password combination;prevalent attack;representative collection","","","","21","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching.

We propose to use the state of correlation between parameters to detect an attack.

Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities.

In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern. By comparing the mobility patterns with the training data, we can distinguish abnormal nodes from normal behavior nodes in mobile Ad Hoc networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of false alarm rate and detection rate for nodes with regular mobility patterns.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150901","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Scalability;Security;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;pattern recognition;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","MANET;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility patterns;mobility profile;multi-leaf tree structure;pattern recognition","","2","","13","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model.

In this paper we present a novel framework, OptiFilter, that mines network packets and host events, based on significant features in intrusion detection. The framework collects network packets and host events continuously in real-time and parses them to a queue of dynamic windows, then it generates connection vectors accordingly.

This paper discusses several operational issues that should be addressed in order to use an IDS effectively. Several anecdotes from the author`s experience are given to illustrate proper and improper use of an IDS. Improper operational use of an IDS can render it ineffective.

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1;9781467318891","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","2","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","94","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

However, anomaly based IDS are usually prone to high false positive rate due to difficulties involved in defining normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. In this paper, we employ two different statistical methods viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop new anomaly based IDS models. We then evaluate the performance of these IDS models on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set and analyze their performance against other IDS models based on Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the performance (Accuracy and Detection Rate) of both the LDA and the LR based models are at par and in some cases even better than other IDS models.

To enhance security, various trust-based schemes have been proposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However, most of them use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection, without taking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high false positives, low malicious node detection rate, and network partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) computation strategy, that adapts the trust threshold in the routing protocol according to network conditions such as rate of link changes, node degree and connectivity, and average neighborhood trustworthiness. We identify the topology factors that affect the trust threshold at each node, and leverage them to build a mathematical model for ATT computation. Our simulation results indicate that the ATT strategy achieves significant improvements in packet delivery ratio, reduction in false positives, and increase in detection rate as compared to traditional static threshold strategies.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345347","MANETs;Trust-based security;adaptive threshold;static threshold;threshold computation","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Measurement;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Security","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","ATT computation strategy;MANETs;adaptive trust threshold strategy;cryptography-based security schemes;distributed architecture;dynamic network topology;high false positive reduction;low malicious node detection rate;mathematical model;misbehaving node detection;misbehaving node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;network partitioning;packet delivery ratio;predefined trust thresholds;routing protocol;static threshold strategy;trust-based schemes","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved cause and effect model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-6695-5;9781424466955","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2537331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423661","Static-sensor networks;mobile-target detection;optimal deployment","Genetic algorithms;Mobile communication;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking","object detection;sensors","dynamic approach;expanding search areas;mobile-target detection;natural terrain variation;on-line reconfigurability;sensor network deployment;static-sensor network;unstructured search areas","","","","63","","2016-03-02","June1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a neighborhood watch concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","0-7803-7952-7;0780379527","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
