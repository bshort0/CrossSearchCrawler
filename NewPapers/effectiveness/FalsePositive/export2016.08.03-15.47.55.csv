Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks. We present a microarchitectural implementation of Minos that achieves negligible impact on cycle time with a small investment in die area, and minor changes to the Linux kernel to handle the tag bits and perform virtual memory swapping.","1072-4451;10724451","0-7695-2126-6;0769521266","","10.1109/MICRO.2004.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550996","","Computer science;Control systems;Counting circuits;Hardware;Internet;Kernel;Libraries;Linux;Microarchitecture;Protection","","","","67","41","36","","","04-08 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6;9781467364256","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So in this paper, we propose a novel method in danger theory field for anomaly detection and decrease the amount of system false alarms by using danger signals which are produced through a KNN classifier.

T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness. In addition, the proposed algorithm was specifically developed to comply with the constrained computational requirements of low-cost embedded network security cyber sensors.

For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based. Analyses has been done for two techniques one belonging to each category. The paper has analyzed and evaluated these with respect to their detection accuracy and capability.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","7","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm was demonstrated on anomalous ICMP network packets (input) and Snort rules (output of the algorithm). Output rules were sorted according to a fitness value and any duplicates were removed. The experimental results on ten test cases demonstrated a 100 percent rule alert rate.

Thus, with a system that seeks only to define and categorize normalcy, there is the potential to detect new types of network attacks without any prior knowledge of their existence.

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","2159-3442;21593442","0-7803-9311-2;0780393112","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor nodes play a important role in alerting us any distinct changes that occur in the sited area and is prone to innumerous attacks. These attacks damage trust with the received data from a sensor node. One such type of attack is the false data injection attack. The message is forged by the adversary, not detected by the forwarding nodes as false information. Compromised node is the origin of false data to be injected in to the WSN. The proposed work discards the false data injected message from the network. This issue of compromised node is handled by the detection and elimination of it from causing further damage to the network by incorporating Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique for data authentication to any message received. A node involved in sensing requires a high range of sensing power. But sensor nodes have limited energy and this is a battle for all technicians in creating any inventions that suits this constraint.

As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods.

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5;0780394275","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria. The general system architecture is presented to allocate the data fusion component within the network. Then, the core functioning and the characteristics of the data fusion component are presented.","","978-1-4577-0383-6;9781457703836","978-0-7695-4388-8;9780769543888","10.1109/CIT.2011.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036822","Data fusion;analyzer;clustering;decision fusion;intrusion detection","Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Data models;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Servers","decision making;information systems;pattern clustering;security of data;sensor fusion","clustering data fusion method;complex systems;decision fusion approach;information systems;intrusion detection system;training dataset","","1","","12","","","Aug. 31 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"How to detect cloned tags in a reliable way from incomplete RFID traces","M. Lehtonen; F. Michahelles; E.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","2374-0221;23740221","978-1-4244-3337-7;9781424433377","","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","8","6","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network based on a set of XML standards. This new architecture and set of protocols brings new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks. Our solution (WS Honeypot) is to deploy a honeypot as a web service application.

Due to special characteristics of these networks, security issue is a difficult task to achieve. Hence, applying current intrusion detection techniques developed for fixed networks is not sufficient for MANETs. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole. Experimental results show that GAAIS is more efficient in comparison with similar approaches.","","978-1-4799-3350-1;9781479933501","","10.1109/IranianCIS.2014.6802607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802607","Ad hoc network;Artificial immune system;Genetic algorithm;Intrusion detection;Routing attack","Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Vectors","artificial immune systems;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AIS;AODV-based MANET;GA;NS2 simulator;NicheMGA algorithm;artificial immune system;blackhole simulator;dynamic intrusion detection technique;flooding simulator;genetic algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor simulator;network topology;network traffic;normal feature vector extraction;routing attack simulation;rushing simulator;security;spherical detector;wireless mobile node;wormhole simulator","","0","","13","","","4-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252;15502252","978-1-4673-0989-9;9781467309899","978-1-4673-0988-2;9781467309882","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach.

In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470964","","","IP networks;ant colony optimisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","ant colony optimisation technique;ant-based DDoS detection technique;ant-based distributed denial-of-service detection technique;bandwidth utilisation wastage;defence system;intruder detection;multilevel IP log table;multilevel secure architecture;pheromone deposit;roaming virtual honeypots;traffic overhead","","","","","","","5 19 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4673-6320-4;9781467363204","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the unattended operation of WSNs and limited processing capabilities of the individual nodes make them vulnerable to a variety of security attacks, especially disruption of information flow or data corruption. For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity. Unfortunately, these strategies are not directly applicable to WSNs since ad-hoc networks are not as resource constrained as WSNs.This paper tries to develop distributed algorithms for detecting anomalous activity in information flow patterns in large-scale sensor networks.

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities.

Moreover, the socket level traffic fingerprinting helps our frame work to achieve a finer granularity on rogue AP detection among the existing schemes. This framework has the following nice properties: i) it requires neither specialized hardware nor modification to existing standards; ii) the proposed mechanism greatly improves the rogue AP detection probability so that network resilience is improved; iii) it provides a cost-effective solution to Wi-Fi network security enhancement by incorporating free but mature software tools; iv) it can protect the network from adversaries capable of using customized equipment and/or violating the IEEE 802.11 standard; v) its open architecture allows extra features to be easily added on in the future. Our analysis and evaluation demonstrate that this hybrid rogue AP protection framework is capable of reliably revealing rogue devices and preempting potential attacks.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-2025-4;9781424420254","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509773","","Fingerprint recognition;Hardware;Mechanical factors;Protection;Resilience;Sockets;Software standards;Surveillance;Telecommunication traffic;Turning","IEEE standards;security of data;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 standard;Wi-Fi network security;centralized wired end socket level traffic fingerprinting;commodity Wi-Fi networks;hybrid rogue access point protection framework;wireless media surveillance","","20","","38","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces. We also discuss the possibility of complementing our anomaly detection algorithm with a spectral-signature intrusion detection system with false alarm filtering and true attack confirmation capability, so as to obtain a synergistic system.","1932-4553;19324553","","","10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6380529","CUSUM;Changepoint detection;ShiryaevRoberts Procedure;TCP SYN attacks;cybersecurity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection;network traffic","Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Tin","computer network security","Shiryaev-Roberts procedure;alarm filtering;attack confirmation capability;changepoint detection method;computer network anomaly detection;computer network traffic;cumulative sum chart;exponentially-weighted moving average scheme;likelihood ratio;multicyclic setting;online anomaly detection;score-based multicyclic detection algorithm;sequential changepoint detection;spectral-signature intrusion detection system;synergistic system","","5","","27","","2012-12-12","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to timely detect intrusions and defend against attack attempts. However, the current IDS technology generates a huge volume of alert events due to false alarm alerts, and requires costly alert manual reviewing due to the lack of intelligence in IDS. As a solution, security information management (SIM) is a growing area of interest in network security. In this paper, we propose FAR-FAR (frame-based attack representation and first-order logic automatic reasoning) system in SIM to relieve the administrator from the time-consuming and costly alert manual reviewing. With the backward-chaining, FAR-FAR can make real-time reasoning for network attack scenarios. In FAR-FAR, the aggregated alerts from different IDS agents are converted into uniform frame-structured streams by case grammar. Afterwards, first-order logic production rules are used to extract the hidden attack scenarios. Our simulation results show that FAR-FAR's attack scenario reasoning rate for the incoming alerts are generally far less than the incoming alerts' inter-arrival time. This guarantees FAR-FAR to automatically reason the attack plans in real time and predict possible attack attempts at an early stage.","","0-7803-8932-8;0780389328","","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503109","","Acoustic sensors;Artificial intelligence;Automatic logic units;Data security;Data visualization;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Production","Internet;backward chaining;frame based representation;frame relay;telecommunication security","Internet;frame-based attack representation;intrusion detection system;network security;real-time first order logic automatic reasoning;security information management;uniform frame-structured stream","","0","","11","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to improve the performance of existing intrusion detection methods which are implemented in the kernel of operating system, this paper focuses on the negative selection algorithm using maximum entropy model to avoid the degeneration caused by the valueless repetition of system calls.

As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

The method is generic, thus, not specific to a particular GP structure, computing platform, or application context. The method is demonstrated on the real-world KDD-99 intrusion detection data set, resulting in solutions competitive with those identified in the original KDD-99 competition, while only using a fraction of the original features.

However, in the past researches on feature selection, the criteria and way about how to select the features in the raw data are seldom referred to. This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental result. In comparison to various types of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means. With the usage of the statistics of network traffic, the better evaluation index, e.g. detection rate and false positive rate, are achieved than any other type of features.

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7;9781424443567","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778;00906778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","2","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","2155-7578;21557578","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","2","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the attacker can modify the exploit component easily, the attacker may not be able to prevent preamble from generating anomalous behavior since during preamble stage, the attacker does not have full control. Previous work on mimicry attacks considered an attack to completely evade detection, if the exploit raises no alarms. On the other hand, in this work, we investigate the source of anomalies in both the preamble and the exploit components against two anomaly detectors that monitor four vulnerable UNIX applications.

Normal TCP traffic flows present periodicity because of protocol behavior. Our results reveal that normal TCP flows can be segregated from malicious flows according to energy distribution properties. We discover the spectral shifting of attack flows from that of normal flows. Combining flow-level spectral analysis with sequential hypothesis testing, we propose a novel defense scheme against RoQ attacks. Our detection and filtering scheme can effectively rescue 99% legitimate TCP flows under the RoQ attacks.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288875","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Frequency domain analysis;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Spectral analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;USA Councils","Internet;filtering theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","QoS;TCP traffic flows;energy distribution properties;filtering scheme;flow-level spectral analysis;protocol behavior;reduction-of-quality attacks;sequential hypothesis testing;spectral analysis;spectral shifting","","15","","28","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Scalable High-Performance Virus Detection Processor Against a Large Pattern Set for Embedded Network Security","C. J. Cheng; C. C. Wang; W. C. Ku; T. F. Chen; J. S. Wang","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Min-Hsiung Chia-Yi, Taiwan, R.O.C.","IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","20120405","2012","20","5","841","854","Contemporary network security applications generally require the ability to perform powerful pattern matching to protect against attacks such as viruses and spam. Traditional hardware solutions are intended for firewall routers. However, the solutions in the literature for firewalls are not scalable, and they do not address the difficulty of an antivirus with an ever-larger pattern set. The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210;10638210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
