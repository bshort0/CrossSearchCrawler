Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods. Only using several attributes also improves the efficiency in terms of attributes constructing, models training as well as intrusion detection.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4244-3309-4;9781424433094","","10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757464","Bayesian networks;C4.5;DDoS attack detection;Intrusion detection system;attribute selection","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;DDoS attacks;attribute selection;;distributed denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system","","3","","16","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an attack detection method based on clustering technique that provide network intrusion detection systems to identify attacks with a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate in analysis and design phase of the software development life cycle.

The main function of IDS is distinguishing and predicting normal or abnormal behaviors. This paper is to propose a model used on IDS, it is based on rough set (RS) theory and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM). Firstly, the model set rough set as a preprocessor of FSVM. Rough set can reduce dimensions of attributes and filter some invasion behaviors which are esay to identify. Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM. For this model, FSVM uses an effective Fuzzy Membership Function based on the affinity among sample points to select an appropriate fuzzy membership to reduce the effects of outliers. Finally, Experimental results will show that the RS-FSVM performs the best recognition ability, indicating that RS-FSVM can serve as a promising model for intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4244-9855-0;9781424498550","978-1-4244-9857-4;9781424498574","10.1109/ISA.2011.5873410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873410","","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Training","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;information filtering;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","FSVM preprocessor;fuzzy membership function;fuzzy support vector machine;information security;intrusion detection system;invasion behavior;rough set theory","","1","","12","","","28-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, a unified collaborative detection framework is developed based on network virtualization technology. Its purpose is to provide a generic approach that can be applied to designing specific schemes for various application scenarios and objectives. Second, a general behavior perception model is proposed for the unified framework based on hidden Markov random field. Spatial Markovianity is introduced to model the spatial context of distributed network behavior and stochastic interaction among interconnected nodes. Algorithms are derived for parameter estimation, forward prediction, backward smooth, and the normality evaluation of both global network situation and local behavior.

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network.

A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-8817-4;9781479988174","","10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497","Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data","mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering","","0","","14","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","265","271","A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826","","Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement","computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering","","0","","8","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the commonly used kernel functions of SVM such as RBF kernel and Gauss kernel are non-orthogonal, whose detection capacity and speed are unsatisfactory for complex non-linear system in IDS. LS-SVM is an evolution of classical SVM. It looks for the solution by solving linear equations instead of a convex quadratic programming in classical SVM.

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-3-8007-3092-6;9783800730926","978-3-00-024883-2;9783000248832","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","2","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model can be flexibly extended to meet different network environment, improve their detection performance and accuracy.","","978-1-4244-6775-4;9781424467754","","10.1109/ICBBT.2010.5478935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478935","Adaptive genetic algorithm;Immunoassay System;Three-layer BP network","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological neural networks;Computer networks;Computer security;Immune system;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pathology","computer network security;neural nets","dynamic security protection technology;false alarm rate;intelligent hybrid network intrusion detection system;neural networks;omission rate","","1","","11","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the early stages of deployment, the intrusion and security problems have not been seriously considered, although they could have a negative impact on VoIP deployment. In the paper, SIP intrusion detection and prevention requirements are analyzed and an IDS/IPS architecture is proposed. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5;1424401445","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","18","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic.

Mobile ad hoc networks do not use any predefined infrastructure during the communication so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s).

To provide an indication of different volumetric motion sensing technologies' strengths and weaknesses in these areas, investigation has been made into the performances of dual and quad element passive infrared, and dual technology passive infrared/microwave sensors. This was accomplished by practical testing, with theoretical analyses of the outcomes before comparison of specific detectors to allow interpretations about each technology type. Some interpretations do not agree with outcomes predicted from theory or common views within the electronic security industry.

We first determine the optimal attack strategy of the malicious vehicle, which, in turn, allows us to analyze the optimal LVS performance as a function of the Rician K- factor of the channel between the BS and a legitimate vehicle. Our analysis also allows us to formally prove that the LVS performance limit is independent of the properties of the channel between the BS and the malicious vehicle, provided the malicious vehicle's antenna number is above a specified value. We also investigate how tracking information on a vehicle quantitatively improves the detection performance of an LVS, showing how optimal performance is obtained under the assumption of the tracking length being randomly selected. The work presented here can be readily extended to multiple BS scenarios and, therefore, forms the foundation for all optimal location authentication schemes within the context of Rician fading channels.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","1","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

Distributed analysis employed by agent-based DIDS is an accepted fabulous method. Clustering-based intrusion detection technique overcomes the drawbacks of relying on labeled training data which most current anomaly-based intrusion detection depend on. Clustering-based DIDS technique according to the advantages of two techniques is presented. For effectively choosing the attacks, twice clustering is employed: the first clustering is to choose the candidate anomalies at agent IDS and the second clustering is to choose the true attack at central IDS. At last, through experiment on the KDD CUP 1999 data records of network connections verified that the methods put forward is better.","2160-133X;2160133X","0-7803-9091-1;0780390911","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527342","Anomaly detection;Cluster;Data mining;Distributed intrusion Detection system;Intrusion detection","Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Protection;Training data","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile agents;security of data;workstation clusters","KDD CUP 1999 data records;agent-based DIDS;clustering-based DIDS technique;distributed intrusion detection system;global distributed information infrastructure","","10","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviours of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process tuned by HPSOWM.

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario. The proposed system, unlike other systems such as VM Introspection (VMI), does not require any knowledge about VMs from inside nor requiring any OS or hypervisor modifications.","","978-1-4673-5325-0;9781467353250","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470945","Cloud Computing Security;Host-Based Anomaly Detection;IDS;IaaS Security;System Calls Monitoring;Virtual Machine Monitoring","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Linux;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machining","Linux;cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IaaS environments;Infrastructure-as-a-Service;Linux KVM-based reference;VM introspection;VMI;detecting anomalies;hypervisor modifications;intrusion detection system;public cloud environments;virtual machine host system call analysis","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this distributed approach introduces new challenges such as self-organization and efficient communication techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for developing, simulating, and deploying a distributed intrusion detection system that consists of several collaborating agents. The framework provides a programming interface and comprises all essential communication and synchronization methods that enables self-organized collaboration in a completely distributed manner. In two experiments we demonstrate the performance and capabilities of our implementation by simulating a large-scale worm outbreak and a one-to-many attack.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for WSN only focus attention on a specified routing protocol, which lacks universality and flexibility. To solve the problem of multi-protocol intrusion detection, this paper proposes a universal method: MPOID (Multi-Protocol Oriented Intrusion Detection). Our work can generate all the attack types for any routing protocol of WSN, furthermore, part of which can be detected with the automatically generated rules accurately. In this work, we formalize the routing protocol with the Process Algebra for Wireless Mesh Networks (AWN) language, and then classify all the potential attacks into four categories according to four original purposes. Beginning from the original purpose, we can generate all the attack targets, attack traces and attack types. What's more, if the protocol process do not use local variables in the key variable assignment, we can also generatethe detection rules for this attack type. Our case study of ADOV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) protocol shows that our method generated all types of attacks, which outperforms other work. Our further theoretical analysis verifies that our detection rules could detect the corresponding attack types as we claimed. In conclusion, the MPOID method could be used as a flexible and universal tool to analyze and detect attack types for multi-protocol in WSN effectively.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336382","AWN;attack analysis;intrusion detection;multi-protocol;wireless sensor networks","Algebra;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Skeleton;Wireless sensor networks","process algebra;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ADOV protocol;IDS;MPOID;WSN;ad hoc on-demand distance vector protocol;diverse routing protocol;dynamic network topology;key variable assignment;multiprotocol oriented intrusion detection method;process algebra;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor network","","","","30","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

MITM targets the actual data that flows between endpoints, and the confidentiality and integrity of the data itself. In this paper, we extensively review the literature on MITM to analyse and categorise the scope of MITM attacks, considering both a reference model, such as the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, as well as two specific widely used network technologies, i.e., GSM and UMTS. In particular, we classify MITM attacks based on several parameters, like location of an attacker in the network, nature of a communication channel, and impersonation techniques. Based on an impersonation techniques classification, we then provide execution steps for each MITM class. We survey existing countermeasures and discuss the comparison among them. Finally, based on our analysis, we propose a categorisation of MITM prevention mechanisms, and we identify some possible directions for future research.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2016.2548426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442758","MITM classification;MITM defence techniques;Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack;security","3G mobile communication;Communication channels;GSM;IP networks;Open systems;Security;Tutorials","","","","","","","","2016-03-29","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The approach taken is to assume that the defender's goal is to thwart attackers by enact optimal tactical responses. It is then shown that, even in an idealized environment, the defender has no guarantee that the correlation system's estimates of the enacted attacks are correct. A theoretical path always exists by which the attacker can influence the contents of the correlation system's low-level alert clusters. As these low-level clusters form the basis of all higher level analyses, this is sufficient to show that the attacker has influence over the tactical assessments reported by correlation systems. In essence, the attackers can cause the defender to mis-correlate an attack's generated INFOSEC alerts in a manner which can go undetected and is to the attacker's advantage. This capability is shown to hinge on there being attacks whose identification requires the analysis of shared alerts (i.e., alerts generated by two or more distinct attacks).","","0-7803-9427-5;0780394275","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532055","","Councils;Fasteners;Game theory;Large-scale systems;Performance analysis;Pressing;Production;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","military communication;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","network security;standard alert correlation systems;tactical assessments;timing characteristics","","0","","23","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5;9781424481835","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge.

Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset.
