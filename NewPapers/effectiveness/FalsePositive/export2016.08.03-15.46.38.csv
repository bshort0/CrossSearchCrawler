The communications between nodes are multihop, and provided in a decentralized way without preexisting infrastructure. These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","2373-0854;23730854","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many Intrusion Detection Systems have been proposed to detect these intrusions. However, as the Internet grows day by day, there is a huge amount of data (big data) that needs to be processed to detect intruders. For this reason, intrusion detection has to be done in real-time before intruders can inflict damage, and previous detection systems do not satisfy this need for big data. Using Apache Storm, a Real time Hybrid Intrusion Detection System has been developed in our work. Apache Storm serves as a distributed, fault tolerant, real time big data stream processor. The hybrid detection system consists of two neural networks. The CC4 instantaneous neural network acts as an anomaly-based detection for unknown attacks and the Multi Layer Perceptron neural network acts as a misuse-based detection for known attacks. Based on the outputs from these two neural networks, the incoming data will be classified as attack or normal. We found the average accuracy of hybrid detection system is 89% with a 4.32% false positive rate. This model is appropriate for real time detection since Apache Storm acts as a real time streaming processor, which can also handle big data.","","","","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336370","Apache Storm;CC4 neural network;Hybrid intrusion detection;ISCX 2012 Intrusion dataset;multi-layered perceptron;real time streaming","Fasteners;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Real-time systems;Storms;Training","Big Data;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;multilayer perceptrons;real-time systems;security of data","Apache Storm;CC4 instantaneous neural network;anomaly-based detection;attack data;data classification;distributed-fault tolerant-real time Big Data stream processor;false positive rate;misuse-based detection;multilayer perceptron neural network;normal data;real-time hybrid intrusion detection system;unknown attacks","","","","10","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is unable to eliminate false packets with short lifespan. Secondly, the algorithm lacks the capability to manage the trade-offs between false and true positives. Consequently, system administrators are frequently swamped with massive false alerts from intrusive packets that cannot achieve their objectives and unfortunately, such alerts are often mixed with few true positives. However, how to substantiate these two generic groups of alerts without incurring additional overheads are classical research issues. Therefore, we present clustering-based adaptive P-filter model to investigate false positives. Alerts from Snort were the input to the P-filter model and they were clustered with some sequential filtering criteria.

That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server. The results of the search techniques are compared to two hand-crafted solutions specified by experts.","","978-1-4244-8341-9;9781424483419","","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635154","autonomic computing;genetic algorithms;genetic programming;search based software engineering","Biological cells;Libraries;Monitoring;Phase measurement;Sensors;Software","fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;search problems","autonomic system;convex-hull geometric object;fault detection;genetic-algorithm;genetic-programming;multidimensional space;random-search approach;search method;software sensor","","2","","25","","","7-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","1530-0889;15300889","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","1","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

According to hacker attacks linked to a certain sequence characteristics, we correlate the alerts through results tracing back to reasons and gain the correlated alerts. This method can found internal relations of invasion, to accurately identify intrusion targets. Through succeed attacks to match the previous attacks, we can greatly reduce the volume of data, and improve speed and efficiency for correlation analysis.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-89-960761-3-1;9788996076131","978-89-960761-3-1;9788996076131","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4897328","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer applications;Computer bugs;Computer hacking;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;National security;Performance analysis","correlation methods;security of data","intrusion alert correlation analysis;intrusion detection system;intrusion target identification;retrospective method","","0","","8","","","21-24 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Monitoring tools based on pattern recognition or behavioral analysis is typically used to ensure network security. SNORT is one such tool which is based on pattern recognition. SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators. This paper proposes a tool which should lessen this burden and considerably reduce the workload of having to classify alerts by human beings.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772652","False Alerts;IDS;JRip;Networks;Neuro-Fuzzy;Security","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection","fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","JRip;NEFCLASS;SNORT alerts;behavioral analysis;false alerts;intrusion detection systems;network security;neuro-fuzzy techniques;pattern recognition","","1","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern recognition techniques have been used for network intrusion detection for more than a decade. Almost all of such intrusion detection systems (IDSs) use an individual classifier to distinguish normal behavior patterns from attack signatures. Moreover these systems have a high false alarm rate and high cost. In this paper, a hierarchical classifier combiner is proposed to detect network intrusions based on the fusion of multiple well-known and efficient classifiers. The KDDCUP99 dataset is used to train and test the classifiers. The overall performance in terms of the overall error rate, average cost and the false alarm rate is investigated and discussed.

Digital forensic analysis of intrusions using alerts generated by existing intrusion detection system (IDS) faces major challenges, especially for IDS deployed in large networks. In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications.

Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope.

As an additional security measure, the intrusion detection system would help determine whether unauthorized users are attempting to access, have already accessed, or have compromised the network Intrusion detection, as the second line of defense, is an indispensable tool for highly survivable networks. In this paper two anomaly intrusion detection methods are proposed for peer-to-peer system. The main characters of the methods are that they can detect intrusion in real-time without any expert knowledge and attack signatures. One method uses hidden Markov model to check reflector DoS attacks, another based on adaptive resonance theory, which can learn the normal behavior with unsupervised method. The experimental P2P system is built on FreePastry 1.401 and JDK 1.5.0.

This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the extended model has significantly reduced the number of false positives.","1089-778X;1089778X","978-1-4244-1339-3;9781424413393","978-1-4244-1340-9;9781424413409","10.1109/CEC.2007.4424907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4424907","","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Mathematical model;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","artificial immune systems;security of data","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of services attacks;extended thymus action;light weight intrusion detection system;malicious traffic;network intrusion detection;network system","","1","4","22","","","25-28 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the Internet becomes more open to public, most people and organizations prefer to use online services. At the same time, the Internet security problem is becoming more severe. An effective and feasible protection measure for network security is necessary. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a typical measure used to provide protection for information systems. In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed. In order to analyze and evaluate the performance of this approach, comparative experiments are implemented with training and testing data from Knowledge Discovery and Data mining cup 1999 (KDD99) dataset. The results show that our approach provides better performance than ordinary anomaly detection approaches with higher true positive rate and lower false positive rate.","","978-1-4673-1696-5;9781467316965","978-1-4673-1695-8;9781467316958","10.1109/ICCPS.2012.6384293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384293","anomaly detection;biological immunity;intrusion detection;memory cell;memory detector","Computers;Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security","IDS;Internet security problem;anomaly detection technique;biological memory cell;generation method;information system protection;intrusion detection system;memory detector;network security;online services;performance evaluation;protection measure","","0","","10","","","19-21 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection.

The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen.

SQL queries are used as a source of events in a protected environment. To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence.

Security requirements in MANET have to be much efficient due to specific characteristics of ad hoc network. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an integral part of any mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It is very important for IDS to function properly for the efficient functioning of a MANET. In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer. We simulate a couple of intrusions in each of the two layers and look to resolve them using the coalition formation of the mobile nodes. These nodes obey the shapely value phenomena of the game theory concept and form coalitions to report intrusions in the network.","","978-1-4244-2962-2;9781424429622","978-1-4244-2963-9;9781424429639","10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760460","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;cluster based cooperative game theory;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile ad-hoc grid","","0","","7","","","14-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node.

A critical performance parameter of any outdoor perimeter intrusion detection system is its capability of discriminating between intrusion and nuisance events without compromising its sensitivity or POD. In this paper, the performance criteria of a real-time fence-mounted distributed fiber-optic intrusion detection system are discussed.

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9;9781467345279","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is near continuous wave (CW) performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3;0780385063","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities.

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users.

This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Multi-agent-based Approach to Improve Intrusion Detection Systems False Alarm Ratio by Using Honeypot","B. Khosravifar; M. Gomrokchi; J. Bentahar","Dept. Comp.

International Conference on","20090626","2009","","","97","102","In this paper we propose a new architecture, which is composed of distributed cooperative agents to reduce the false alarm ratio of the intrusion detection systems (IDS) in a twofold contribution. The first contribution lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection in an agent-based architecture by using honeypot network as the closer level of investigation. The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed. In this paper the architecture of the proposed system is described, a theoretical analysis of agents' behavior is given and its possible extensions are explained.","","978-1-4244-3999-7;9781424439997","978-0-7695-3639-2;9780769536392","10.1109/WAINA.2009.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136631","","Computer architecture;Game theory;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Performance analysis;Real time systems;Scalability","game theory;multi-agent systems;security of data","attack detection;distributed cooperative agents;false alarm ratio;false alarm recognition;game theoretic analysis;honeypot network;intrusion detection systems;multiagent based approach","","0","","11","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection using fuzzy clustering of TCP packet attributes. The method is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to evolutionary approaches.

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently. Moreover, constructed connections are very adequate for training and evaluating IDS models.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750267","data aggregation;intrusion detection;performance monitoring;real-time systems","Correlation;Cryptography;Measurement;Receivers;Silicon","data handling;security of data","DARPA dump data flow;IDS;data stream handling;dynamic window size;heterogeneous data stream;intrusion detection systems;massive data flow conversion;network security;nonstationary data stream;queuing concept;simulated network;time slot windows;university campus","","0","","33","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern DoS attacks that blend normal and malicious network traffic, significantly increase the rate of false alarms, hence challenge the effectiveness of IDS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
