Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While considerable attention has been given to data mining for intrusion detection in wired networks, limited focus has been devoted to data mining for intrusion detection in wireless networks. This study presents a clustering approach with tracers and expert analysis for intrusion detection in a real-world wireless network. Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and promise of the proposed approach, laying the groundwork for a clustering-based framework for intrusion detection in wireless computer networks.","","0-7695-2495-8;0769524958","","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607440","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;expert systems;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless networks;clustering techniques;data mining;distance-based heuristic measure;expert analysis;intrusion detection;label clusters;network traffic metrics;wireless computer network;wireless network security","","5","","5","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prediction of normal and abnormal request is problematic due to large number of false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems (IDS). SS-IDS derives automatically the parameter profiles from the analyzed data thereby generating the statistical signatures. Statistical signatures are based on modeling of normal requests and their distribution value without explicit intervention. Several attributes are used to calculate the behavior of the legitimate request on the web server. SS-IDS is best suited for the newly installed web servers which doesnpsilat have large number of requests in the data set to train the IDS and can be used on top of currently used signature based IDS like SNORT.

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4;9781424446384","978-1-4244-4639-1;9781424446391","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS.

However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints.

In this paper, we propose a distributed energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomalies in sensed data can be caused due to compromised or malfunctioning nodes. In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile.

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.

Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node.

This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions.

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands and/or measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage electrical grid and a corporate network, we investigate the use of modeling versus a hybrid test bed to conduct actual cyber attacks on SCADA and to analyze their consequences on SCADA and on the electrical grid. Modeling is in charge of predicting consequences of cyber attacks on SCADA and the electrical grid, while the test bed is in charge to reproduce cyber attacks and their propagation more realistically then modeling. The hybrid test bed is constituted by the coexistence of actual and simulated systems and devices of SCADA, corporate network and the electrical grid. The final hybrid test bed will include the most adequate models essentially to reproduce missing components such as the electrical grid and parts of corporate network and SCADA system.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4799-3530-7;9781479935307","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6986997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986997","critical infrastructure protection;cyber attacks;electrical grid;interdependency analysis;scada","Circuit breakers;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers;Substations","SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;power engineering computing;power grids","ICT pervasiveness;SCADA control centre;catastrophic failures;corporate network;critical infrastructures;cyber attackers;cyber attacks;cyber security;equipment communications;information and communication technologies;medium voltage electrical grid;nervous system;remote devices;supervision control and data acquisition","","1","","13","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3;9781424484843","978-0-7695-4159-4;9780769541594","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","4","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that scene change analysis can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies.

Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security.

In this paper, we contemplated an anomaly detection model which uses machine learning algorithms for data mining within a network to detect anomalies present at any time. This proposed model is evaluated against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks while selecting the most common and evident features of IPv6 and IPv4 networks for optimizing the detection. The results also show that the proposed system can detect most of the IPv4 and IPv6 attacks in efficient manner.","","978-1-4673-7398-2;9781467373982","","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443752","","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Training","IP networks;computer network security;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","DOS attacks;IPv4 network;IPv6 network;anomaly detection model;attack detection;behaviour pattern analysis;data mining methodology;denial of service attacks;machine learning algorithms","","","","28","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system.

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999). Experiments indicate that AEC can effectively recognize and correlate individual stages of multi-stage attacks, stop incomplete attack stages, and give network administrators meaningful and concise alerts","","0-7695-2564-4;0769525644","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609998","","Aggregates;Bridges;Computer crime;Computer science;Conferences;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bro NIDS;active event correlation;computer attacks;multistage attack detection;network intrusion detection system;security policies","","2","","20","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7;9781479981717","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9;9781467300889","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","2329-6267;23296267","978-1-4244-3763-4;9781424437634","","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate).

Examples show that the algorithm is capable of realizing memorizing and forgetting processes and increasing the robustness and self adaptability of IDS.","","978-1-4244-5204-0;9781424452040","978-1-4244-5206-4;9781424452064","10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361130","Network security;ant colony algorithm;pheromone","Aerodynamics;Brain modeling;Computer applications;Databases;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load modeling;Robustness","optimisation;security of data","ant colony algorithm;ant colony memory principle;human brain;intrusion detection system;memory process;pheromone","","0","","4","","","23-25 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152 seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection).

These misbehaviors can be defined by monitoring features belonging to different Android levels. In this paper we present MADAM, a novel host-based malware detection system for Android devices which simultaneously analyzes and correlates features at four levels: kernel, application, user and package, to detect and stop malicious behaviors. MADAM has been designed to take into account those behaviors characteristics of almost every real malware which can be found in the wild. MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data from attack trials were used to correlate the signals from real attacks and the fence tester.

This model focuses on interaction between pair of attacking/regular nodes as a two player noncooperative non-zero sum game.","","978-1-4244-3594-4;9781424435944","978-1-4244-3595-1;9781424435951","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787668","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET);game theory;non cooperative game;security","Ad hoc networks;Computer network management;Educational institutions;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;telecommunication security","communication wireless nature;game theory;intrusion detection;malicious activities;mobile ad hoc networks;noncooperative game approach;noncooperative nonzero sum game;self-organization network;temporary network life","","2","","9","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Tracing cyber attacks from the practical perspective","Zhiqiang Gao; N. Ansari","New Jersey Inst. of Technol., Newark, NJ, USA","IEEE Communications Magazine","20050620","2005","43","5","123","131","The integrity of the Internet is severely impaired by rampant denial of service and distributed DoS attacks. It is by no means trivial to devise a countermeasure to address these attacks because of their anonymous and distributed nature. This article presents a brief survey of the most promising recently proposed schemes for tracing cyber attacks: IP traceback. Since IP traceback technology is evolving rapidly, for the community to better comprehend and capture the properties of disparate traceback approaches, we first classify these schemes from multiple aspects. From the perspective of practicality and feasibility, we then analyze and explore the advantages and disadvantages of these schemes in depth so that shortcomings and possible enhancements of each scheme are highlighted. Finally, open problems and future work are discussed, and concluding remarks are drawn.","0163-6804;01636804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2005.1453433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453433","","Bandwidth;Delay;Engines;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Isolation technology;Robustness;Stochastic processes","IP networks;Internet;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication services","IP traceback;Internet;cyber attack;denial of service;distributed DoS attack","","22","1","15","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
