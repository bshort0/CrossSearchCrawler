Then, they are used to instrument the web application at source code level, so that a deviation from the normal profile can be detected at run-time. This paper illustrates on simple examples how the approach detects well known categories of web attacks that involve a state violation of the application, such as SQL injections.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

The classification is based on the number of file server and mail server attacks observed during a fixed window. The spammer naively attacks (with a known distribution) his main target: the mail server. The spy strategically selects the number of attacks on his main target: the file server. The defender strategically selects his classification policy: a threshold on the number of file server attacks. We model the interaction of the two players (spy and defender) as a nonzero-sum game: The defender needs to balance missed detections and false alarms in his objective function, while the spy has a tradeoff between attacking the file server more aggressively and increasing the chances of getting caught.

The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem","","0-7803-5965-8;0780359658","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181","","Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring","electric fields;safety systems","electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions","","1","","4","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. The goal is to recognize signatures of known attacks, match the observed behavior with those known signatures, and signal intrusion when there is a match. A major difficulty of this system is that intrusions signatures change over the time and the system must be retrained. An IDS must be able to adapt to these changes.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","2161-5322;21615322","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, one of the challenges with many modern algorithms is that they run too slowly in software to have any practical value. This paper proposes a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based intrusion detection system (IDS), driven by a new coupled metric learning to discover the inter- and intra-coupling relationships against the growth of data volumes and item relationship to provide a new approach for efficient anomaly detections. This work is experimented on our previously published NetFlow-based IDS dataset, which is further processed into the categorical data for coupled metric learning purpose. The overall performance of the new hardware system has been further compared with the presence of conventional Bayesian classifier and Support Vector Machines classifier. The experimental results show the very promising performance by considering the coupled metric learning scheme in the FPGA implementation.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4673-2433-5;9781467324335","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack). Still, under normal traffic its running-time is worse than classical AC implementations.

Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, denial of service (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach cross layer based intrusion detection system(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA).

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting by an overview of the existing work in this field, and ending up with the proposal of a new distributed and cooperative architecture for intrusion detection. In order to overcome the weaknesses and flaws of the existing MANET intrusion detection systems (IDSs), this architecture integrates an agent-based detection process. So, the main principle of the proposed architecture is based on: (a) the distribution which is achieved through the implementation of a local intrusion detection system on each network node, and (b) the cooperation that is guaranteed by mobile and stationary agents' collaboration. In that way we were able to have an IDS with so many interesting features such as: flexibility, distribution and cooperation, autonomy, lightweight, reactivity and fault tolerance which are extremely desired for any MANET intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-0798-7;9781467307987","","10.1109/ITNG.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209126","distributed and cooperative;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent system","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multiagent systems","computer network security;groupware;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;multi-agent systems","IDS;MANET intrusion detection system;MASID;agent-based detection process;cooperative architecture;distributed architecture;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile-stationary agent collaboration;multiagent system;network node","","2","","12","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Selecting appropriate network features is one of the factors that influence the accuracy of SDC model. Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates. The result shows the importance of data preprocessing in producing a high quality SDC Model.","2164-7143;21647143","978-1-4244-8134-7;9781424481347","","10.1109/ISDA.2010.5687051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687051","Data Mining;Features Selection;Genetic algorithm feature selection;JRip algorithm;Signature Detection","","data mining;decision trees;digital signatures;feature extraction;pattern classification;security of data","KDD-cup99 data sets;PART;Ridor;Ripper(Jrip);biased attribute removal;customized features;data mining;data preprocessing;decision three;detection rate;false alarm rate;features extraction;features selection;intrusion detection system;network security;security audit data set;signature detection classification model","","2","","18","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. (Rather than STIDE or Stide or s-tide, we have chosen stide in keeping with the way the detector was referred to in the paper by Warrender et al., 1999.) Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, why six? accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the why six issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.806130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159659","","Blindness;Change detection algorithms;Computer security;Detectors;Embedded computing;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Solids","computer viruses","anomaly-based intrusion detector;data sequences;detection blindness;detection capability;information security;intrusion detection;masqueraders;novel attacks;operational limits;root privileges;sequence lengths;stide","","24","","13","","","Jan 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","187","194","This paper describes the architecture and provides early test results of the reconnaissance intrusion detection system (RIDS) prototype. RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1;0780385721","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2;9781479950782","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system is trained using a 66% of randomly selected connections in as a subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection data set. The training model is created by a trained classifier and then used to classify the remaining 34% subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset in order to report on the effectiveness of the model. The results show that based on a selected set of features extracted using subset evaluation algorithm for classifiers and a best-first search mechanism, that decision tree algorithm J48 based on C4.5 provides 99.95% of correctly classified instances and is better than the Naive Bayes technique.

In response to this, a number of countermeasures have been developed, including intrusion detection systems that aim to detect anomalous behaviour caused by attacks. We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network. The attack space on a mesh network is particularly large; we motivate the need for and describe the challenges of adopting an asset-driven approach to managing this space.

Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs.

In these type of networks all communication occurs through a wireless medium and the nature of the network is decentralized and dynamic. Hence it probes for a number of security problems and in order provide security against malicious attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is commonly used as a second route of protection in MANET. Intrusion detection models are used to detect the attacks based on the patterns and alerts in case of intruders are being met with the system. In this paper, we propose and implement intrusion-detection system grounded on artificial neural network model such as Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based competitive network, which in turn plays a vital role in detection of malicious nodes based on input data patterns. The proposed model deals with different types of attacks and their detection approach based on SOM model. The approach aids at increasing Detection rate as well as reducing the False alarm rate, which in turn helps to detect those attacks before it makes larger damage to the network and prevent them with supportive techniques and increase the network performance. The experimental results of proposed model is evaluated under different parameters.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996118","Detection rate;False alarm rate;Intrusion detection;MANET;SOM;artificial neural network;security","Data models;Interrupters;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Neurons","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;SOM based competitive network;artificial neural network model;false alarm rate reduction;input data patterns;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile ad-hoc networks;security problems;self organizing map;wireless medium","","0","","28","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0;9781479927630","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes.

In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current.

We find that the performance for both detectors degrades as shown by their Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves when intra-cloud live migration is initiated while VMs are under a netscan (NS) or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2014.6968968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968968","Cloud computing;anomaly detection;live VM migration","Computer crime;Conferences;Detectors;Entropy;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Vectors","cloud computing;computer network security;virtual machines","K-means;PCA;ROC curves;anomaly detection;denial-of-service attack;intracloud live migration;live intracloud virtual-machine migration;netscan;receiver operating characteristic curves;resource management;security issues;virtualized cloud environments","","2","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this aim it is essential to distinguish between the natural variability of traffic due to its bursty nature and attack-related anomalous events. In this paper we investigate the applicability of neural networks for traffic prediction, focusing on the multilayer feedforward architecture and comparing the performance of different back-propagation algorithms. Prediction is carried out for different random aggregates (obtained through reversible sketches, introduced to improve the scalability of the solution) of traffic flows and, after comparing the prediction error with a threshold, a voting procedure is used to decide about the nature of the current data (with the additional possibility of identifying anomalous flows thanks to the features of reversible sketches). The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method (in terms of low false alarm rates and convergence speed) for an adequate choice of the learning algorithm.","2378-4865;23784865","","","10.1109/CAMAD.2014.7033256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033256","Anomaly Detection;Neural Network;Sketch","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological neural networks;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms","IP networks;multilayer perceptrons","IP networks management;back-propagation algorithms;bursty nature;learning algorithm;multilayer feedforward architecture;neural network based anomaly detection;performance analysis;traffic prediction;voting procedure","","0","","22","","","1-3 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Game Theoretic Framework for Reputation-Based Distributed Intrusion Detection","A. Bradai; H. Afifi","","Social Computing (SocialCom), 2013 International Conference on","20140102","2013","","","558","563","Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)have been widely used to detect malicious behaviors of nodes in heterogenous networks. Collaborative intrusion detection can be more secure with a framework using reputation aggregation as an incentive. The problem of incentives and efficiency are well known problems that can be addressed in such collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation. Simulation was conducted to validate our proposed technique. The results demonstrate that it is desirable to strike a balance between system security and network performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-9266-4;9781424492664","978-1-4244-9267-1;9781424492671","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134252","","Accuracy;Delay;Greedy algorithms;Optimization;Security;Time factors;Vectors","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;management information systems;optimisation;pattern matching","IDPS configuration set;attack protection;attacking pattern matching;enterprise information system performance;enterprise information system usability;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;malicious packet dropout;network performance requirement;rule mode selection optimization;security enforcement levels","","0","","16","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
