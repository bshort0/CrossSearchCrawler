We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

This paper discusses a means by which perimeter alarm systems can be combined to reduce the Nuisance Alarm Rate or False Alarm Rate (FAR) without compromising the Detection Rate (DR). Alarm systems operate on different principles and so have different strengths and weaknesses. Here we report work the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) has conducted on combining complementary systems to reduce the FAR that would result from using either system on its own. We have ANDed a Video Motion Detection (VMD) System and a fence mounted microphonic Perimeter Intrusion Detection System. If each simultaneously goes into alarm, an operator is alerted. ANDing is not a new concept and has been used before, but not as far as we know to combine a Video Motion Detector (VMD) with a Fence Mounted System (FMS) at a real problem site. This paper reports and discusses the results from several operational trials of this combination of detectors. It gives a view on the practical value of ANDing such systems","","0-7803-3913-4;0780339134","","10.1109/CCST.1997.626259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=626259","","Alarm systems;Detectors;Flexible manufacturing systems;Intrusion detection;Motion detection","alarm systems;closed circuit television;safety systems;surveillance;television applications","ANDing alarm systems;Police Scientific Development Branch;complementary systems;detection rate;false alarm rate;fence mounted microphonic perimeter intrusion detection system;nuisance alarm rate;perimeter alarm systems;video motion detection","","0","","","","","15-17 Oct 1997","15 Oct 1997-17 Oct 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature selection technique removes the redundant features and builds a time consuming better-performed intrusion detector framework. This study presents a cross-breed type feature selection approach using duo filter schemes for intrusion detection. In this framework feature selection technique eliminate the irrelevant features to reduce the time complexity and build a better model to predict the result with a greater accuracy and Bayesian network based classification model has been built up to predict the types of attacks. The experiment shows that the proposed framework exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy which is 97.2746% and keeps the false positive rate at a lower rate of 0.008. The model shows better performance in terms of accuracy than other leading state-of-the-arts frameworks like Boosted DT, Hidden NB, KNN and Markov chain.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Proposed Intrusion Detection on ZRP based MANET by effective k-means clustering method of data mining","S. Sumit; D. Mitra; D. Gupta","Dept. of CSE/IT, Manipal Univ. Jaipur, Jaipur, India","Optimization, Reliabilty, and Information Technology (ICROIT), 2014 International Conference on","20140417","2014","","","156","160","Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) consist of peer-to-peer infrastructure less communicating nodes that are highly dynamic. As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network. Thus, our Ad-Hoc network will be free from any malicious activity and normal flow of packets will be possible.","","978-1-4799-3958-9;9781479939589","","10.1109/ICROIT.2014.6798303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798303","IARP;IDS effective k-means clustering;IERP;MANET;ZRP","Flowcharts;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Protocols;Routing","data mining;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols;telecommunication security","K-means clustering method;MANET security;ZRP based MANET;ad-hoc network;clustering technique;data mining;data transmission;intrusion detection system;intrusive behavior;k-means;local routing information;malicious activity;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;packet flow;peer-to-peer infrastructure;proactive protocols;random topology;reactive protocols;route discovery mechanism;route discovery procedure;routing data;zone routing protocol","","1","","8","","","6-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1;9781479915941","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A good way to identify malicious use is through monitoring unusual user activity. To identify these malicious activities various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. This paper proposes Self Configuring Intrusion Detection System (SCIDS) to make tuning automatically. The key idea is to use the binary SLIPPER as a basic module, which is a rule learner based on confidence-rated boosting. This system is evaluated using the NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset.

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At each time, only a subset of the processes can be observed, and the observations from each chosen process follow two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous processes may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Switching between processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the processes during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We develop a simple closed-loop policy (i.e., decisions depend on past observations and actions) for the anomaly detection problem. Asymptotic optimality of the proposed policy is shown when a single process is observed at a time and strong performance are demonstrated by simulation examples under multi-processes probing.","","","","10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028432","Anomaly detection;Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT);sequential hypothesis testing","Conferences;Indexes;Reliability;Search problems;Sensors;Switches;Testing","closed loop systems;network theory (graphs);search problems","anomaly detection process;asymptotic optimality;closed-loop policy;independent process;multiprocess probing;reliability constraints;sequential anomalous process detection;sequential search strategy;state declarations","","1","","37","","","Sept. 30 2014-Oct. 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS.

By comparing the pattern exhibited by live traffic with the expected behavior recorded in the profile, intrusive activities like compromising backdoors or invoking trojan programs are successfully detected","","0-7803-5925-9;0780359259","","10.1109/IWS.1999.810999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=810999","","Computer networks;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Protocols;Robust stability;Surveillance;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;surveillance;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic recording","abnormal network traffic;anomalous traffic pattern;compromising backdoors;expected behavior;intrusion detection;intrusive activities;live traffic;malicious activities;network surveillance method;network traffic pattern;port profiling;suspicious activities;system exploitation;trojan programs;unusual conducts","","2","3","26","","","1999","18 Feb 1999-20 Feb 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some values such as octets transferred range several orders of magnitudes, from several bytes to million bytes. The role of network features depends on which pattern to be detected: normal or intrusive one. Intrusion detection rates would be better if we know which network features are more important for a particular pattern. We therefore propose an automated feature weighting method for network intrusion detection based on a fuzzy subspace approach. Experimental results show that the proposed weighting method can improve the detection rates.","","978-1-4244-2172-5;9781424421725","978-1-4244-2173-2;9781424421732","10.1109/SYSOSE.2008.4724144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724144","Network intrusion detection;automated feature weighting;fuzzy c -means;fuzzy entropy;subspace vector quantization","Australia;Computer networks;Computer vision;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Vector quantization","fuzzy set theory;security of data","automated network feature;fuzzy c-means;fuzzy entropy;network intrusion detection;subspace vector quantization","","3","","25","","","2-4 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5;9781424484485","978-0-7695-4236-2;9780769542362","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experimental platform includes a power grid simulator of the IEEE 30 bus model and a cyber network emulator. Subsequently, we implemented a wide range of integrity attacks (replay, ramp, pulse, scaling, and random) with different intensity levels.

In this paper, we introduce a new technique that is considered as a stealth attack for web user over wireless networks. The proposed technique creates a crafting spoof web content and sends it to a user before the geniune web content from a website is transmitted to the user.

In the proposed framework, there are two modules, the data preprocessing module and the classifier module. Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.","","978-1-4673-1937-9;9781467319379","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119","Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting","Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model","","0","","32","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations.

Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset.

Twenty-Third Annual","20080102","2007","","","87","96","Progress in insider-threat detection is currently limited by a lack of realistic, publicly available, real-world data. For reasons of privacy and confidentiality, no one wants to expose their sensitive data to the research community. Data can be sanitized to mitigate privacy and confidentiality concerns, but the mere act of sanitizing the data may introduce artifacts that compromise its utility for research purposes. If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy.

Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research.

An automated and adaptive defensive tool is imperative for computer networks. One of the emerging solutions for Network Security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark.

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8;0769521088","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. Finally, the intrusion detection method is evaluated through simulation experiments.","","","","10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60163-2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072389","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocol;security;timed automata","Automata;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","","","","Aug. 2008","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation.

To tackle the issues, in this paper, we propose the MSP-system: Mobile Secure Passport System. The objective of the MSP-system is to detect malicious mobile users and to prevent them from participating in mobile networks. The MSP-system is consisted of the MSP (Mobile Secure Passport) and the MSP-gateway. The MSP, which is a secure mobile device, preserves users' history information. The MSP-gateway detects malicious users by checking the history information about network activities when users try to log into networks. Thus, the MSP-system can prevent malicious users from attacking in mobile networks. Through simulation experiments, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the MSP-system.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267572","","Airports;Computer network management;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Conferences;History;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Position measurement","Internet;computer crime","MSP gateway;MSP system;malicious mobile users;malicious user detection;mobile networks;mobile secure passport system","","0","1","10","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
