Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

The growing network intrusions have put companies and organizations at a much greater risk of loss. In this paper, propose a new learning methodology towards developing a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) by back propagation neural networks (BPN). The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. Test the proposed method by a benchmark intrusion dataset to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency. The proposed method can significantly reduce the training time required. Additionally, the training results are good.

WMNs provide reliable connectivity and fault-tolerance, as each node is connected to several other nodes. If a node fails due to hardware problems, its neighbors can find another route. Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network. This paper presents an algorithm for detection of selfish nodes in a WMN that uses statistical theory of inference for reliable clustering of the nodes.

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security. We identify factors that are critical for the efficacy and acceptance of learning methods in security.

This paper presents an approach to detect intrusion based on data mining frame work. In the framework, intrusion detection is thought of as clustering. The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various. In the illustrative example, the number of attributes is reduced greatly and the detection is in a high precision for the attacks of DoS and Probe, a low false positive rate in all types of attacks.","","978-1-4244-5821-9;9781424458219","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497340","FCM;data mining;intrusion detection","Availability;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Probes","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","DoS attack;FCM;Probe;data mining techniques;fuzzy c-means clustering;intrusion detection approach;optimal attribute set;reduction algorithm;redundant attribute set","","2","","18","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device.

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack.

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927;10636927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance.

This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the 1999 KDD Cup data set.

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), named Least Square Support Vector Machine based IDS (LSSVM-IDS), is built using the features selected by our proposed feature selection algorithm. The performance of LSSVM-IDS is evaluated using three intrusion detection evaluation datasets, namely KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ dataset.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for stepping-stone detection using a pervious mapping-based detection method. The technique reduces the detection problem to finding a mapping between two streams of packets. If our algorithm cannot find the mapping, then no such mapping exists. But if there is a mapping, then the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find one and the solution will always be the one with minimum indexed.

The performance of a binary classification system can be measured on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) is exactly the Wilcoxon rank sum or Mann-Whitney U statistic, both of which are nonparametric statistics based upon ranked data. Successful performance of an unsupervised ensemble can be measured through the AUC, and the performance of different aggregation techniques for the combination of the multiple classification system decision values, or rankings in this paper, is illustrated.

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2169-X;076952169X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","10","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models.

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

The clustering algorithm has the advantage that it does not depend on priori knowledge and has nothing to do data distribution, effectively overcoming the disadvantage that some existing algorithms are sensitive to initialization and easy to be trapped into the local optima. This algorithm clusters large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical values effectively. The intrusion detection system based on this algorithm can deal with massive unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and anomaly and even can detect unknown attacks.

With the aid of APT malware, attackers can remotely control infected machines and steal sensitive information. DNS is popular for malware to locate command and control (C&C) servers. In this paper, we propose a novel system placed at the network egress point that aims to efficiently and effectively detect APT malware infections based on malicious DNS and traffic analysis. The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries. Our security approach cannot only substantially reduce the volume of network traffic that needs to be recorded and analyzed but also improve the sustainability of the system.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2458581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163279","APT;DNS;intrusion detection;malware infections","Command and control systems;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Malware;Web servers","Big Data;Internet;digital signatures;invasive software;query processing","APT malware infection detection;Big Data;C&C servers;DNS query;IP address;Internet;advanced persistent threat;anomaly based detection technology;command and control server;feature vector;large local institute network;malicious DNS analysis techniques;network egress point;network traffic features;security approach;signature-based based detection technology;traffic analysis","","0","","28","","2015-07-20","2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To overcome the vulnerabilities of network security researchers have come up with different frameworks of intrusion detection system using data mining. Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier.

In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data.

Specifically, we apply a type of filtering we term IDS stream splitting, which consists of classifying each packet as either trusted or un-trusted when it is encountered between the sniffer and the IDS (within the firewall). This classification allows for fewer packets to be sent to an IDS devoted to examining un-trusted traffic. The logic of the splitter looks at each packet as part of a connection and give it a trust ranking from [0..1] using a fuzzy logic model.

Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since most of the known attacks can be represented with strings or combinations of multiple substrings, string matching is a key component, as well as the bottleneck in NIDS to address the requirement of constantly increasing capacity. We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity.

Therefore, the immune learning algorithm and the attack detection mechanism are given. The risk of Web attacks is quantitatively analyzed on the relationship between the antibody concentration and the state of an illness in biological immune system (BIS).

Compensation for any performance shortcoming is sometimes effected by resorting to correlation techniques, which could be seen as making use of detector diversity. Such diversity is intuitively based on the assumption that detector coverage is different - perhaps widely different - for different detectors, each covering some disparate portion of the anomaly space. Diversity, then, enhances detection coverage by combining the coverages of individual detectors across multiple sub-regions of the anomaly space, resulting in an overall detection coverage that is superior to the coverage of any one detector. No studies have been done, however, in which measured effects of diversity amongst anomaly detectors have been obtained. This paper explores the effects of using diverse anomaly-detection algorithms in intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that while performance/coverage improvements can in fact be effected by combining diverse detection algorithms, the gains are not the result of combining large, non-overlapping regions of the anomaly space. Rather, the gains are seen at the edges of the space, and are heavily dependent on the parameter values of the detectors, as well as on anomaly characteristics. Based on this study, defenders can be provided with knowledge of how combinations of diverse, sequence-based detectors behave to effect detection performance superior to that of a single detector.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2282-3;0769522823","","10.1109/DSN.2005.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467796","","Computer science;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Diversity reception;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Performance gain;Protocols;Security","fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;security of data","anomaly detector performance;anomaly-detection algorithm;intrusion detection;sequence-based detector","","0","","21","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, normal-anomaly patterns are built over the network traffic dataset that uses subtractive clustering, and at the same time the built Hidden Markov Model (HMM) correlates the observation sequences and state transitions to predict the most probable intrusion state sequences. The proposed unsupervised anomaly detection approach is capable of reducing false positives by classifying intrusion sequences into different emergency levels.

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously.

The next issue related to the intrusion detection systems is the feature reduction, extraction, and selection. In this paper, an intrusion detection model was created by genetic algorithms (GA) and the construction of the classifying models based on the training data observed from the genetic algorithm by KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm has been taken into consideration.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4673-1565-4;9781467315654","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7;0769514057","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network.

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features.

An anomaly dete-ction method based on K-means clustering is introduced to detect and filter request flooding attacks and asymmetric attacks. To defend against session-flooding attacks, we propose an encouragement model that uses client's session rate as currency. Detection model drops suspicious sessions, while currency model encourages more legitimate sessions. By collaboration of these two models, normal clients could gain higher service rate and lower delay of response time.","","978-0-7695-2858-9;9780769528589","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438303","","Application software;Business;Computer crime;Delay effects;Floods;Military computing;Pressing;Protocols;Security;Telecommunication traffic","information filters;security of data","DOW;K-means clustering;anomaly detection method;application layer DDoS attacks;asymmetric attacks;attacks layer-7 session flooding attacks;defense and offense wall;filter request flooding attacks;offense mechanism","","8","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%. The performance of the system is compared with many recent bot detection methods.","","978-1-4799-2177-5;9781479921775","","10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745439","Botnet detection;Neural Network;host-based;packet traffic;traffic characterization and modeling","Data preprocessing;Entropy;Feature extraction;Filtering;Malware;Neural networks;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer network security;entropy;feature extraction;invasive software;neural nets","HTTP traffic;World Wide Web;bot detection methods;bot infected hosts;bot traffic;botnets;data theft;denial of service attacks;entropy;features extraction;high detection rate;network traffic;neural network classifier;spamming;stealthy bots;traffic features;traffic profile;unlabeled traffic","","2","","26","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently proposed traceback mechanisms are inadequate to address the traceback problem for the following reasons: they lack incentives for ISPs to deploy IP traceback in their networks; they do not scale to large scale distributed DoS attacks. In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.","","978-0-7695-3825-9;9780769538259","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555","IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging","Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router","","3","","24","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","0191-2216;01912216","978-1-4799-7746-8;9781479977468","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms.

There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

"Towards reducing human effort in network intrusion detection","C. Catania; C. Garc&#x00ED;a Garino","ITIC, Univ.

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels. Prototype relays on a hybrid detection and evolutionary summarizing schemes The viability of the two schemes has been confirmed trough experiments considering different attack distributions and types.","","978-1-4799-1426-5;9781479914265","","10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663006","Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","attack distributions;attack types;evolutionary summarizing scheme;human effort reduction;hybrid detection scheme;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection;network traffic model generation;prototype relays","","0","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Enhancing the pervasive trust management model in MANETs by analyzing the factors affecting performance of various attacks","P. Durairajan; T.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2;9781424490042","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, intrusions are increasingly taking multi-stage procedures to attack a system, and cannot be detected by existing single stage intrusion detection systems. This paper proposes a multi-stage intrusion detection system architecture using hidden Markov model algorithm. This system considers every stage used by recent intrusions and applies them to the hidden Markov model algorithm to determine which intrusion is used in the audit data. This architecture reduces overheads of intrusion agents and raises efficiency of the whole system.","","978-0-7695-3080-2;9780769530802","","10.1109/ICISS.2008.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438213","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Computer security;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual private networks","computer networks;hidden Markov models;security of data;telecommunication security","audit data;hidden Markov model algorithm;multistage intrusion detection system;network attacks;system protection","","4","","9","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
