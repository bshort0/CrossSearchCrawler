A prototype section of barrier has been produced and installed at the Sandia Exterior Intrusion Sensor Testing Facility in Albuquerque, NM. The prototype was implemented with a robust vehicle barrier and coupled with a variety of detection and assessment solutions to demonstrate both the effectiveness of such a solution, as well as the flexibility of the system. In this implementation, infrared sensors and fence disturbance sensors are coupled with a video motion detection sensor and ground sensors.

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, most of the current researches are using only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability on detecting new types of attack as well as a higher tolerant to fluctuations were shown.

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers. We carried out theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard for discovery, blocking, and traceback of malicious traffic.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2465934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182328","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor;intrusion detection system;malicious traffic","Bandwidth;Law;Logic gates;Malware;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;digital forensics;invasive software;law;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;TorWard;administrative complaints;botnet traffic;denial-of-service attack traffic;dual-tone multifrequency signaling-based approach;forensic traceback;intrusion detection system;legal complaints;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic traceback;malware traffic;spam;suspect connections;university campus","","0","","55","","2015-08-07","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, every intrusion detection approach has been limited by their problems: signature-based intrusion detection can identify the known intrusions but cannot detect the novel intrusions, anomaly-based intrusion detection has the potential to detect all intrusions but has the limitation of a higher false alarm rate. For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, it is also found that static analysis (Wagner, et al., 2001), with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495951","","Access control;Authentication;Computational efficiency;Computer applications;Face detection;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling","digital signatures;feature extraction;program diagnostics","anomaly-based intrusion detection;behavior model;feature vector;information security infrastructure;model inaccuracy;model incompleteness;signature-based intrusion detection;static analysis","","4","1","27","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that these systems can roam on multiple networks, with no guarantee on security adopted on each network, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the mobile platforms can be beneficial in preventing cyber-attacks. One of the key problems with implementing IDS on mobile platforms is the increased power consumption. This paper presents low power circuits that implement the string matching tasks within the Snort IDS. These tasks can take up to 80% of the power consumed for Snort.

First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","2","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

OppNets exploit the characteristics of the human social, such as similarities, daily routines, mobility patterns and interests to perform the message routing and data sharing. Packet dropping attack is one of the hardest attacks in Opportunistic Networks as both the source nodes and the destination nodes have no knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a new malicious nodes detection technique against packet faking attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and instead of them injects new fake packets. We have called this novel attack in our previous works a packet faking attack. Each node in Opportunistic Networks can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, hash chain techniques. In our hash chain based defense techniques we have two phases. The first phases is to detect the attack, and the second phases is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature.

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3447-3;9780769534473","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection.

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the normal behavior DNA sequence through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique.

In this paper, we selectively cap the packet payload to reduce write speed and storage requirements on hard drives and further reduce the computational burden of packet analysis. The proposed techniques take advantage of most packet payloads being useless for analysis purposes, because they are either encrypted or in a proprietary application non-readable format. Conversely, non-ASCII packets from well-known protocols and protocols with some ASCII data are fully captured as they may be potentially useful for network analysis. We have named this approach as selective capping, and we have implemented and integrated it into a high-speed network driver and a software module at user level, to make its operation more transparent and faster to upper layer applications.

Recently, data mining techniques have gained importance in providing the valuable information which in turn can help to enhance the decision on identifying the intrusions (attacks). In this paper; we evaluate the performance of various rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and decision table using ensemble approach in order to build an efficient network intrusion detection system. We use KDDCup'99, intrusion detection benchmark dataset (which is a part of DARPA evaluation program) for our experimentation.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","24","3","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.","0197-7385;01977385","978-1-4244-4332-1;9781424443321","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320","","Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar","sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication","high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes","","0","","1","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","3","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection systems have success in exposing new attacks, commonly referred to as `zero' day attacks, yet have high false positive rates. False positive events occur when an activity is flagged for investigation yet it was determined to be benign upon analysis. Computational power and valuable resources are wasted when the irrelevant data is processed, data flagged, analyst alerted, and the irrelevant data is finally disregarded. In an effort to make intrusion detection systems more efficient the false positive rate must be reduced. This paper proposes a model for reducing false positives using data mining techniques by combining support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and Naive Bayes.","","","","10.1109/SECON.2016.7506774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506774","Data-Mining;Decision Trees;False Positives;Intrusion Detection System;Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machines","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Vegetation","Bayes methods;computer network security;data mining;decision trees;support vector machines","data-mining techniques;decision trees;false positives;host packets;intrusion detection systems;malicious activities;naive Bayes;network packets;off-line analysis;support vector machines","","","","","","","March 30 2016-April 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network.

An adaptive mutation rate is applied, and the mutation type is selected heuristically from weight adaptation, node deletion and node addition.

Aiming at the problems of traditional techniques, an immunity-based dynamic method for network anomaly detection, referred to as WAD, is proposed in this paper. WAD builds an appropriate profile using only a subset of normal elements and adapts the varieties of self and non-self space, which adjust adaptively the self radius, the detection radius, and numbers of detectors to amend the built profile.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","2","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice.

It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique compared to conventional schemes","2155-6806;21556806","0-7803-9465-8;0780394658","","10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542870","","Cryptography;Disaster management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Protection;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;infrastructure-type wireless networks;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network topology;self adaptive intrusion detection","","3","","26","","","7-7 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a wrapper feature selection approach that combines an improved version of the Binary Bat Algorithm with two classifiers (C4.5 and SVM). We test our proposed model on the NSL-KDD dataset and empirically prove that our method can boost the performance of the classifiers and outperforms BBA and BPSO in terms of attack detection rate and false alarm rate, obtained after a fewer number of iterations. Furthermore, we reduced the number of features with almost 64% and improved the performances of the classifier, even for unknown intrusions.","","","","10.1109/TSP.2015.7296215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296215","BBA;C4.5;Feature Selection;IDS;SVM","Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Silicon;Support vector machines;Training","feature selection;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","BBA;BPSO;C4.5;NSL-KDD dataset;SVM;attack detection iteration;binary bat algorithm;cyber threat;false alarm rate;information security assurance;intrusion detection;overwhelm security systems;wrapper feature selection approach","","","","15","","","9-11 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7;9781467326247","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion.

The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed. The communication among the system's components preserves the confidentiality of the packet's information.

Commonly this task is performed by antivirus software tools that rely on prior explicit knowledge of the worm's code, which is represented by signatures. We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality.","2161-4393;21614393","0-7803-9490-9;0780394909","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716409","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Classification tree analysis;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Laboratories;Magnetic heads;Software tools","decision trees;invasive software;neural nets;pattern classification","artificial neural networks;classifications techniques;computer worm detection;decision tree;k-nearest neighbors","","2","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The Power of Temporal Pattern Processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection","M. Al-Subaie; M. Zulkernine","Queen's Univ., Kingston","2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications","20070813","2007","","","1391","1398","A clear deficiency in most of todays anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
