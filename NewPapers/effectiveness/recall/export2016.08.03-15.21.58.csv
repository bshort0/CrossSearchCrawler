"CluSID: a clustering scheme for intrusion detection improved by information theory","R. Shokri; F. Oroumchian; N.

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to delete the redundant and noisy features, improve the performance of IDS, we present an efficient IDS based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) method. Kernel methods are the effective approaches to intrusion detection problems.

However, the concern of the privacy information leakage has also arisen, which impacts on both financial organizations and customers. It is important for stakeholders in financial services to be aware of the proper information classifications, by which determining which information can be shared between the financial service institutions. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a new approach that use combined supervised learning techniques to classify the information in order to avoid releasing those information that can be harmful for either financial service providers or customers.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks.

We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks.

These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic.

However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate.

The existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the Data-Base (DB-IDS) is a necessity because enterprises awash in data often struggle to answer basic question about detecting or preventing all facet of their threat. In this paper, we propose a novel type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level) in a high-rate transaction processing. For simplicity, our model is divided into two parts; detection method at transaction level and inter-transaction level (detection with learning method, concurrently in both level). Detection method at transaction level is based on describing the expected (normal) transactions within the database applications. This is also focused on anomaly detection and used data mining to find dependency and sequence rules (the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity) in where inter-transaction level is used. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. Simulation and implementation experiments in Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI) revealed the accuracy of our models. The experiment results demonstrated the true positive detection rate is higher than 0.8, and the false positive detection rate is lower than 0.1 choosing appropriate ranges for support and confidence thresholds.

The scheme allows us to collect the raw data from a controlled environment and then process to have 16 features (traffic and content features) with full labels. The collected dataset is called LUT13. We then applied two well-known machine learning techniques: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) to train the system based on this dataset. The system, after trained on LUT13, was tested on the real environment and compared with the system constructed based on KDD Cup 1999.

In a large monitoring environment where targets are distributed over an entire monitored region, deploying static sensors leads to high hardware costs because a high number of sensors may be required to achieve network connectivity. This paper considers the target-patrol issue where a set of mobile data mules (DMs) are dispatched to efficiently patrol the given targets under a predefined time constraint. The targets are assigned weights indicating their importance, where more important targets should be visited more frequently by the DMs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a time-constrained weighted targets patrolling (TCWTP) algorithm for locally constructing efficient patrol paths, thereby ensuring globally stable intervals between visits to all target points. A performance analysis revealed that the proposed TCWTP mechanism outperforms existing works in terms of the average interval between visits, quality of monitoring satisfaction ratio, and monitoring fairness ratio.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2378212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000577","Data collection;sweep coverage;target coverage;target {coverage};weighted target patrolling;wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSNs);wireless mobile sensor {networks} (WMSNs)","Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Time factors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile communication;wireless sensor networks","DM;TCWTP algorithm;deploying static sensors;mobile data mules;monitored region;monitoring environment;monitoring fairness ratio;monitoring satisfaction ratio;time constrained weighted targets patrolling;time constrained weighted targets patrolling mechanism;wireless mobile sensor networks","","0","","31","","2014-12-31","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper devises a high-speed deep packet inspection algorithm with TCAM by using an m-byte jumping window pattern-matching scheme. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of TCAM lookups per payload by m times with the marginally enlarged TCAM size which can be implemented by cascading multiple TCAMs. Due to the reduced number of TCAM lookups, we can easily achieve a multi-gigabit rate for scanning the packet payload. Furthermore, multi-packet inspection is achieved easily by the extended state transition diagram with the shifting distance. With simulation results, we have clearly justified the proposed algorithm works well for a multi-gigabit network intrusion detection system.","1090-3038;10903038","978-1-4244-1721-6;9781424417216","978-1-4244-1722-3;9781424417223","10.1109/VETECF.2008.166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4656998","","Associative memory;Degradation;Ethernet networks;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Software performance;Switches","computer networks;content-addressable storage;pattern matching;performance evaluation;security of data;table lookup","TCAM based pattern-matching algorithm;TCAM lookups;cyber threats;high-speed deep packet inspection algorithm;high-speed networks;m-byte jumping window pattern-matching scheme;malicious attacks;multigigabit network intrusion detection system;multigigabit rate pattern-matching method;multipacket inspection;network protection;packet payload;performance evaluation;shifting distance;state transition diagram","","0","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we model the activity of an intruder with a Markov chain of finite state space, corresponding to logical or physical states in a network, and suppose there is a state b which we would not like the intruder to enter. The intruder, on the other hand, would like to enter this sensitive part of the network and wants to spend as much time there as possible. The state of the intruder evolves in discrete time; also there are a limited number of opportunities for the security system to make state observations over the finite horizon of the problem. This model can be used to capture the essence of intrusion detection in a variety of situations such as hackers in a network or physical intruders in a spatial area where there is a constraint on the number of observations one may make due to power limitations. We develop an optimal policy for dynamically scheduling observations to minimize the amount of time that the intruder spends in b without being discovered.","","978-1-4673-0008-7;9781467300087","978-1-4673-0723-9;9781467307239","10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167419","IT security;decision making;dynamic programming;intrusion detection;monitoring;network security;resource allocation;surveillance","Communities;Dynamic programming;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Vectors","Markov processes;computer network security","IT networks;Markov chain;alarm intrusion detection;computer network;finite state space;network logical states;network physical states;optimal policy","","0","","14","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","7","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","","","","10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306574","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;DNS;Wi-Fi;data mining;machine learning","Conferences;Cross layer design;Databases;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Protocols","data mining;protocols;security of data;statistical analysis","DNS protocols;IDS;IP protocols;OSI model;TCP protocols;UDP protocols;Wi-Fi protocols;anomaly behavior analysis modules;communications protocols;computer networks;cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;data mining;false alarms;mobile devices;network capacity;partial attack model;smart devices;smart phones;statistical techniques;tablet computers;wearable computing","","","","7","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

After comparing various design options, we adapted from hash table data structure, employing the special hardware unit assist to calculate a hash over our unique ascending order quadruple which worked in a quite simple but efficient way that is totally different from the Snort scheme, our design not only differentiates both directions of a TCP connection and thus eliminates unwanted additional search operation, but also avoids data corruption and greatly reduces the probability of hash collisions. In order to improve the allocation/deallocation procedure for TCP connection nodes in our IDS systems, we further devised a large management stack caching with a local memory buffer, which is fully exploiting the specialized network processor architectures and optimizing the use of various types of memories with different speeds and size. The theoretical analysis and experiments confirmed that the combination of a large conventional hash table-based search and an array-based stack with caching improves the performance significantly.","","978-0-7695-3997-3;9780769539973","","10.1109/ICEE.2010.338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5591627","IDS;hash table;nework processor;stack and cache","Context;Delay;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Random access memory;Resource management","cache storage;computer network security;cryptography;parallel processing;transport protocols","NP based IDS;SCUT NIDS;TCP;array based stack;hash table;network processor architecture;portscan detection module;stack caching","","0","","6","","","7-9 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty.

The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%).

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naive Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7;9781467313667","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed Denial of service attacks pose a serious threat to VOIP network security. SIP servers are victims of DDos attacks. The major aim of the DDos attacks is to avoid legitimate users to access resources of SIP servers. Distributed Denial of service attacks target the VOIP network by deploying bots at different locations by injecting malformed packets and even they halt the entire VOIP service causes degradation of QoS(Quality of Service). DDos attacks are easy to launch and quickly drain computational resources of VOIP network and nodes. Detecting DDos attacks is a challenging and extremely difficult due to its varying strategy and scope of attackers. Many DDos detection and prevention schemes are deployed in VOIP networks but they are not complete working in both realtime and offline modes. They are inefficient in detecting dynamic and low-rate DDos attacks and even fail when the attack is launched by simultaneously manipulating multiple SIP attributes. In this paper we propose a novel scheme based on Hellinger distance(HD) to detect low-rate and multi-attribute DDos attacks. Usually DDos detection and mitigations schemes are implemented in SIP proxy. But we leverage the SIP load balancer to fight against DDos by using existing load balancing features. We have implemented the proposed scheme by modifying leading open source kamailio SIP proxy server. We have evaluated our scheme by experimental test setup and found results are outperforming the existing DDos prevention schemes in terms of detection rate, system overhead and false-positive alarms.","","","","10.1109/ICGCIoT.2015.7380646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7380646","Overload Control;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);kamailio;server","Computer crime;Feature extraction;Floods;Internet telephony;Multimedia communication;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;quality of service;resource allocation;signalling protocols","DDoS attack detection;DDoS attack mitigation;Hellinger distance;QoS;SIP load balancer;SIP-based voice over IP network;VOIP network security;distributed denial of service attack;open source kamailio SIP proxy server;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malicious behavior may target the disruption of communications, infrastructure services, and applications. A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency.

We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

This is a challenge because intrusion detection systems built for conventional computer systems tend to be unsuitable. They can be too demanding for resource-restricted cyber-physical systems or too inaccurate due to the lack of real-world data on actual attack behaviours. Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks. We observe that the addition of physical input features can markedly reduce the false positive rate and increase the overall accuracy of the detection.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368559","Command injection;Cyber-physical attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decision tree;Denial of service (DoS);Intrusion detection;Mobile robots;Network security","Computer crime;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Robot kinematics;Vehicles","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;decision trees;mobile robots;security of data;telerobotics;vehicles","attack behaviours;automobiles;command injection attacks;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision tree-based detection;denial of service attacks;detection rules;disk data;drones;false positive rate;intrusion detection systems;mobile cyber-physical systems;network traffic;physical input features;physical jittering;power consumption;security;small remote-controlled robotic vehicle","","","","28","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3641-5;9780769536415","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222872","Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;decision condition;rough set reduction;system call","Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Set theory;Software","hidden Markov models;rough set theory;security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network security;rough set reduction","","0","","11","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","978-1-4799-2548-3;9781479925483","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","0","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework.

Anomaly detection in networks is of interest from two perspectives: an organization's perspective and an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) perspective. Protection of its computer network infrastructure is an important task for all organizations. Organizations desire that their networks are robust and resilient to any kind of attack. Anomaly detection forms an important part of this network resiliency. Also the ISPs want to maximize the utilization of their resources. Hence an ISP would be interested to know any resource failure immediately so as to correct the problem. ISPs would also be interested in safeguarding their network from malicious activities. We describe here a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based traffic verification system as a paradigm for network anomaly detection. The traffic characteristics aggregated over a period of time is given to the model to verify the validity of the traffic. If the traffic does not obey the model then we raise an alarm flagging it as an anomaly. Our results show that the system performs with less than 1% misses and false alarms.","","978-1-4673-0815-1;9781467308151","","10.1109/NCC.2012.6176909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176909","Anomaly detection;Gaussian Mixture Model;Intrusion detection;Network Traffic Modeling;Network security","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Data models;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Training;Vectors","Gaussian processes;Internet;computer network security","GMM-based traffic verification system;Gaussian mixture model;ISP perspective;Internet Service Provider;computer network infrastructure protection;network anomaly detection;network resiliency;organization perspective;port-based traffic verification;resource failure;traffic characteristics","","1","","18","","","3-5 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
