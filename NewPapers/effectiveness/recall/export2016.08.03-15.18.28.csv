"Data Processing on FPGAs","J. Teubner; L. Woods","","Data Processing on FPGAs","20140702","2013","","","","","Roughly a decade ago, power consumption and heat dissipation concerns forced the semiconductor industry to radically change its course, shifting from sequential to parallel computing. Unfortunately, improving performance of applications has now become much more difficult than in the good old days of frequency scaling. This is also affecting databases and data processing applications in general, and has led to the popularity of so-called data appliancesspecialized data processing engines, where software and hardware are sold together in a closed box. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) increasingly play an important role in such systems. FPGAs are attractive because the performance gains of specialized hardware can be significant, while power consumption is much less than that of commodity processors. On the other hand, FPGAs are way more flexible than hard-wired circuits (ASICs) and can be integrated into complex systems in many different ways, e.g., directly in the network for a high-frequency trading application. This book gives an introduction to FPGA technology targeted at a database audience. In the first few chapters, we explain in detail the inner workings of FPGAs. Then we discuss techniques and design patterns that help mapping algorithms to FPGA hardware so that the inherent parallelism of these devices can be leveraged in an optimal way. Finally, the book will illustrate a number of concrete examples that exploit different advantages of FPGAs for data processing.

In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets. This technique is then evaluated using a large dataset and the correctness of the classifier is verified by using `area under the receiver operating characteristic curves'(ROC AUC) measures across various string metric-based classifiers.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503226","","","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","honeynets;machine learning method;malicious footprints;malicious network streams;malware;misuse based intrusion detection system;receiver operating characteristic curves measures;security threats;string metric based classifiers","","2","","16","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the immune principle of antigen presenting, this paper proposes a mechanism of Abnormity Presenting and Abnormity Triggering, which means detecting only when need.

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

This study employs both support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to investigate the time-varying fraud problem. The performance of ANN is compared with that from SVM.

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators. This paper proposes a tool which should lessen this burden and considerably reduce the workload of having to classify alerts by human beings.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772652","False Alerts;IDS;JRip;Networks;Neuro-Fuzzy;Security","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection","fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","JRip;NEFCLASS;SNORT alerts;behavioral analysis;false alerts;intrusion detection systems;network security;neuro-fuzzy techniques;pattern recognition","","1","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion.

Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system.

This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems. Then, it presents a brief explanation of the behavior of the cells of the biological immune system, which are treated as internal agents inside a biological organism.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as virus free by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048  128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681;15228681","978-1-4673-5956-6;9781467359566","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","4","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model. Where in one of the simulated scenarios we are able to detect a benign cluster of hosts faster than the traditional correlation model.","","978-1-4673-5306-9;9781467353069","","10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579517","Botnet;botnet detection system;cooperative game theory;correlation;game theory","Computational modeling;Correlation;Data models;Game theory;Games;Ports (Computers);Security","command and control systems;correlation methods;game theory;invasive software;smart phones;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;Shapley value;botnet detection;click fraud;command and control channel;cooperative game theoretical correlation based model;distributed denial of service;host level detection;mass identity theft;smartphones;spam;trusted hosts","","0","","21","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model.

An effective and feasible protection measure for network security is necessary. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a typical measure used to provide protection for information systems. In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed. In order to analyze and evaluate the performance of this approach, comparative experiments are implemented with training and testing data from Knowledge Discovery and Data mining cup 1999 (KDD99) dataset.

In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method.

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection.

Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Moreover, our results show that the LZ-based detection scheme performs better than the Markov-based detection scheme, especially for low-speed mobile users","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2006.874579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658433","Anomaly detection;cellular mobile networks;mobility","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computer science;History;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Probability;Protection;Sun","Markov processes;cellular radio;data compression;matrix algebra;telecommunication security","Lempel-Ziv-based detection;Markov-based detection schemes;cellular mobile networks;data compression techniques;mobility-based anomaly detection;online anomaly detection schemes;probability transition matrix","","13","2","21","","","July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.","","","","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172","Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training","Cloud computing","cache storage;cloud computing;computer network security;finite state machines;pattern classification;protocols","DNS hijacking attacks;DNS protocol;DNS security;DNS traffic transition;DNS-IDS;IP addresses;anomaly metric;attack detection rate;bagging algorithm;cache poisoning attacks;classification algorithms;cloud computing;cloud era;cloud security;cloud services;finite state machine;intrusion detection system;normal temporal statistics;operational costs;operational phase;state machine;training phase","","","","19","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data.

In the proposed mechanism, detection, expert, and console modules are developed. In which, the detection module is deployed with numbers of independent sensors on each node/device of the network. This module not only takes the responsibility to detect and collect all of the desired information on each different timing period and stage, but also denotes specific weighting function to indicate the significance of possible influence and tune the value according to the frequency and times of the occurrence of security events on each collected data. All of the collected audit data and detected normal/abnormal signals will be transferred to the database of the expert module for further integrated evaluation on those multiple observing factors and processed with synthetic information and associative events analysis based on hidden Markov model algorithm on multidimensional. After then, the fuzzy inferring rule is applied for intrusion recognition and identification. The console module is assigned to manage the performance of the system, control all of the sensors for monitoring security events and generate alerts and offer periodically reports and present proposals for taking suitable response and making optimal decision.

"Testing the effects of recency and inertia on cyber threat detection through Instance-Based Learning","R. Reddy; Basava Raju Kanaparthi; V.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9;9781467345279","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is near continuous wave (CW) performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3;0780385063","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present Fates, an anomaly-based NIDS designed to alleviate the two challenges. Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities. We use various datasets to validate Fates's ability to distinguish scanning behavior from benign traffic in real time.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","978-1-4244-1251-8;9781424412518","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317884","Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System","Computer science;Entropy;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Real time systems;Signal detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;real-time systems;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Fates real-time anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;network host monitoring;network traffic;real-time anomaly detection","","0","","25","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users.

Traditionally, PCA is performed in a centralized manner, which has poor scalability for large distributed systems, on account of the large network bandwidth cost required to gather the distributed state at a fusion center. Consequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA algorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without losing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-0773-4;9781467307734","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075;15302075","978-1-4244-6442-5;9781424464425","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently.

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.","1095-2055;10952055","0-7803-9428-3;0780394283","","10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866","","Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic","","3","","17","","","17-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.

Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs. SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu. We find 27 previously unknown SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in Ubuntu applications, most of which are also distributed with other Linux distributions.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163045","","Accuracy;Libraries;Protocols;Security;Servers;Software;Testing","Linux;application program interfaces;formal verification;program diagnostics;protocols;security of data","API design;Linux distributions;SSL usage vetting;SSL-TLS protocols;SSLINT;Ubuntu;application program interfaces;automatic logic verification;code quality;logic correctness;network attacks;secure sockets layer;static analysis system;transport layer security","","0","","52","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WMNs provide reliable connectivity and fault-tolerance, as each node is connected to several other nodes. If a node fails due to hardware problems, its neighbors can find another route. Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network. This paper presents an algorithm for detection of selfish nodes in a WMN that uses statistical theory of inference for reliable clustering of the nodes. Simulation results show that the algorithm has a high detection rate and a low rate of false positives.","","978-1-4244-7817-0;9781424478170","","10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643647","AODV protocol;analysis of variance;clustering;node misbehavior;selfish node;wireless mesh network","Automata;Clustering algorithms;Monitoring;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols","antennas;fault tolerance;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels;wireless mesh networks","WMN;antennas;broadband backhaul;fault-tolerance;network traffic;node clustering;packet dropping nodes;selfish routers;statistical theory;wireless channels;wireless mesh networks","","0","","17","","","8-10 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No protocol has been designed and implemented so far to parameterize security as a QoS parameter. However, it has been noted recently that security and QoS are highly intertwined; security mechanisms may severely affect QoS mechanisms in terms of network performance and data confidentiality. In addition, users are not given the choices on which security services and mechanisms as well as which security level should be applied to their traffic. A security-enhanced quality of service-based (SQoS) network has been presented recently, with two major objectives. One objective is to offer the users elastic choices on the treatment of messages with appropriate security mechanisms with respect to their own QoS and budget requirements. Another objective is to facilitate interaction between security and QoS mechanisms in the most efficient manner by providing information to each other. In this paper, the network performance is investigated by defining the utility functions and maximizing the user's benefits subject to a set of constraints","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605990","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Laboratories;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","performance evaluation;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","SQoS network;network performance analysis;network traffic;security-enhanced quality of service;utility function","","1","","8","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main aims of DSC is to deal with the attacks by minimising the attack surface between two hosts. In our model, light weight security policies are enforced at the client machines to ensure that the client can access the services using legitimate traffic only. This will minimise the number of attacks that can be generated by the malicious client machine on the server. We will show that our model can increase the availability of the critical services. Our model can also be used as an early detection technique for the outbreak of worms.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4673-0267-8;9781467302678","978-1-4673-0268-5;9781467302685","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211959","Distributed Service Control;Local Area Networks;Virtual machine monitor","IP networks;Local area networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","invasive software","DSC;attack surface minimization;critical service security;distributed service control technique;light weight security policies;malicious client machine;security attack detection;worm outbreak","","0","","8","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
