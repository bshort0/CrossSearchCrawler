However, for a comprehensive intranet security strategy, such defenses alone may not be enough. An enterprise needs mechanisms to analyze alerts and detect real attacks, and policies on how to respond to attacks. A framework for effective response to detection of misuse or attack is a central theme. The focus is towards security of corporate intranets. We first discuss the access control models that are currently being deployed and used at most intranet solutions. Using role based access control as a base, we develop a framework of interaction of various entities in the model. We then propose a prioritization scheme based on cost of impact in case of misuse and business criticality of transactions. The scheme is developed based on categorization and prioritization of risk and vulnerability assessment results for an enterprise intranet. Alerts are a critical element of a real-time response, but how alert engines operate and filter tons of log data decides the effectiveness of such infrastructure. We propose incorporation of priority schemes into alert mechanisms to develop a more effective intrusion countermeasure against misuse and attack. It leverages the enterprise's investment in security technology to develop an optimized solution to respond to those attacks, by advising the enterprise's on-site administrators.","","0-7803-7808-3;0780378083","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232418","","Access control;Authorization;Computer science;Costs;Data security;Filters;Information security;Investments;Search engines;USA Councils","authorisation;business communication;computer crime;intranets;risk management","access control model;alert engines;alert mechanism;business transaction;corporate intranet;enterprise intranet;enterprise security;intranet access security;intrusion countermeasures;prioritization scheme;real-time response;risk assessment;role based access control","","0","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a Union then Minimize framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a Minimize then Union framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","4","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

According to the limitation of SK-SVM, in this paper we present an intrusion detection method based on multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM). MK-SVM can calculate the weights of kernel functions and Lagrange multipliers simultaneously through semi-infinite linear programming, and thus achieve the choice of kernel functions and the optimization of classifier. Furthermore, in order to reduce the time and space required of this method, we adopt feature selection and clustering method in the process of input data preprocessing.

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Inst., Waseda Univ., Tokyo, Japan","16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","20140327","2014","","","223","232","The MANETs have been experiencing exponential growth in the past decade. However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","1738-9445;17389445","978-89-968650-2-5;9788996865025","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An IP flow is a unidirectional series of IP packets of a given protocol, traveling between a source and destination, within a certain period of time. Based on flow concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as flow key.

Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described.

However, it is currently unknown how likely an IDS is to detect a given Internet-wide scan pattern and whether there exist sufficiently fast scan techniques that can remain virtually undetectable at large-scale. To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0;9780769537160","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By dialing further digits he can switch off selected electrical appliances which might have activated the fire. Also, an intruder detector circuit incorporated with the telephone automatically dials digits to reach a public emergency service and upon receiving the response the attachment unit extends a recorded voice message to the called end informing about the intrusion. As these are simple means of maintaining the home security they can easily be adopted to any environment. Alternatively, with cell phone installed in home for this purpose the above techniques are implemented.

The neuro-fuzzy approach was experimented with different background knowledge sets in DARPA 1999 network traffic dataset. The approach was evaluated and compared with RIPPER algorithm.

NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection system) is an effective approach for dealing with these security issues. Their detection engines use two main approaches to inspect malicious traffic; misuse detection and anomaly detection. Machine learning approaches have been widely investigated in anomaly detection systems. However, despite multiple academic researches, such systems are rarely employed in operational settings. They suffer from long time training, lack of good quality training data and a random selection of features (training attributes). This paper aims to resolve issues of limited quantity and quality of training data sets and investigates the impact of features selection process on the classification performance. It introduces a novel framework to extract efficient real ground-truth training data sets from the network traffic for supervised machine learning algorithms.

In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected.

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack.

The malignant skin tumors much resemble benign nevus, mole or dysplastic naevi. For dermatologists, it is a tedious task to analyze every patient sample more precisely, so it needs a decision support system to analyze the danger associated with a given sample. In this work color images of melanoma are imparted to classify them among malignant and benign classes using Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimized by Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO). As a part of the preprocessing step, an illumination compensation based segmentation algorithm is deployed. The segmentation process is followed by the proposed iterative dilation method to remove noise from a lesion.

To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed, signature-based anomaly detector that evaluates the trustworthiness of others so as to secure such a distributed detection. Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences. We further introduce a novel indicator which measures the level of confidence in the detection.

Narlikar","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE","20100506","2010","","","1","9","The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","6","2","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population. Our preliminary experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic database traces show that our methods work well in practical situations","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2461-3;0769524613","","10.1109/CSAC.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565245","","Access control;Data privacy;Data security;Database systems;Demography;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Spatial databases","authorisation;data mining;database management systems","DBMS;RBAC-administered databases;anomalous behavior detection;assurance security solution;data privacy;database management system;database mining;intruder identification;intrusion detection system;role based access control","","19","1","25","","","5-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks.

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4;9781849199094","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment. A quantitative analysis is provided by TIDeS, using fuzzy logic, under varying network loads. We also propose robust metrics to evaluate an IDS. We follow up with recommendations, based on our experience, on the general practices in the field of IDSs.","","0-7695-2117-7;0769521177","","10.1109/IWIA.2004.1288040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288040","","Fuzzy logic;Information security;Intrusion detection;Logic testing;NIST;Protocols;Robustness;System testing;Telecommunication traffic;Tides","computer networks;fuzzy logic;message authentication;telecommunication traffic","computer network security management;fuzzy logic;intrusion detection system","","2","","35","","","8-9 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve the detecting efficiency of detectors and the dependence of matching threshold on an experienced value in the negative selection algorithm, an algorithm named VRGA for detector generation is proposed in this paper. Variable matching threshold r (r-variable) is introduced in VRGA to effectively increase the detector coverage. Clonal selection strategy considering detector similarity is adopted to increase the diversity of detectors. With above two improvements, VRGA brings the self-adaptability of matching threshold in negative selection and reduces the dependence of matching threshold on experience. In addition, VRGA increases the coverage and diversity of the detector set. The experimental results show that VGRA has better performance and its detecting efficiency is also improved correspondingly over the traditional negative selection algorithm.","2157-9555;21579555","978-0-7695-3304-9;9780769533049","","10.1109/ICNC.2008.617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4667907","artificial immune;concentration of detector;matching threshold;negative selection","Biology computing;Computer science;Detectors;Educational institutions;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Phase detection;Protection;Random number generation","pattern matching;security of data","VRGA;clonal selection;detector generation;detector similarity;immune-based intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm;self-adaptability;variable matching threshold","","1","","17","","","18-20 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.","","978-1-4673-1326-1;9781467313261","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418660","Wireless Network;classification;detection;jamming;security","Benchmark testing;Business process re-engineering;Communication system security;Jamming;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;pattern classification;radio networks","IDS framework;MAC layers;attack classification;intrusion detection system;jamming attack classification;jamming based DoS attacks;jamming detection;multiple security threats;physical layers;wireless networks;wireless transmissions","","0","","26","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 W output power to the IOT smart nodes.

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative. Based on these values the Accuracy and error rate of each classifier is computed.","","978-1-4799-5521-3;9781479955213","","10.1109/ICCICT.2015.7045674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045674","Feature selection;Hidden Nave Bayes;NBTree;Nave Bayes;classification;discretization","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Training","data mining;decision trees;feature selection;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","NBTree classifiers;NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes method conditional independence assumption;data dimensionality;data mining approach;data mining model;data preprocessing activities;decision tree classifiers;dimension reduction;feature discretization;feature selection algorithm;hidden Naive Bayes classifiers;machine learning algorithms;record class label identification","","0","","20","","","15-17 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malicious executables are analyzed using two approaches: disassembly, utilizing IDA-Pro, and the application of a dedicated state machine in order to obtain the set of functions comprising the executables. The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures. Evaluation of F-Sign was conducted under various conditions. The findings suggest that the proposed method can be used for automatically generating signatures that are both specific and sensitive.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2068544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585792","Automatic signature generation (ASG);malware;malware filtering","Binary codes;Grippers;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Real time systems;Software","digital signatures;error detection;finite state machines;invasive software","F-sign;IDA-Pro;automatic extraction;automatic signature generation;common function repository;deep packet inspection;entropy score;false positive detection error;function-based signature generation;high speed network traffic filtering device;intelligent candidate selection;malware;signature candidate list;signature extraction process;state machine","","1","","38","","2010-09-27","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495980","","Ad hoc networks;Computer vision;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Training data;Wireless LAN","access protocols;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MAC layer anomaly detection;MAC layer traffic data;WLAN;ad hoc networks;attack source localization;behavior characterization;cross-feature analysis;end-to-end intrusion detection mechanism;feature vectors;mobile node;network layer misbehavior;ns-2 simulations;routing attacks;wired network;wireless local area networks","","6","1","21","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such information can be used to verify web alerts generated by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Web Intrusion Detection Systems (Web IDSs). In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method. We show that our approach significantly reduces false and non-relevant alerts with quite low processing overhead, thus enhances the quality of the results.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994044","HTTP Protocol;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Firewall;alert verification;web attack","Accuracy;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Protocols;Web servers","Internet;computer network security;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;HTTP transaction metadata analysis;OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set;WAF;Web IDS;Web application firewalls;Web attack;Web attack vector knowledge-base;Web driven alert verification;Web intrusion detection systems;Web server;alert verification module;reconfigured ModSecurity;request headers;request method;status code","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a family of parallel and distributed algorithms for Graphic Processing Units (GPU) derived from two distance-based outlier detection algorithms: the BruteForce and the SolvingSet.

In Deauth-DoS attack an attacker sends a large number of spoofed de-authentication frames to the client (s) resulting in their disconnection. Existing solutions to mitigate Deauth-DoS attack rely on encryption, protocol modifications, 802.11 standard up gradation, software and hardware upgrades which are costly.

Simulation results from the prototype system correlate detection accuracy with a tunable input tolerance factor.","","978-0-7695-2847-2;9780769528472","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221158","","Authentication;Data security;Fuzzy neural networks;Information security;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols","embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","deviant agent;embedded device network;embedded intelligent intrusion detection;intelligent intrusion detection system;interconnected agents;machine learning;prototype system correlate detection accuracy;tunable input tolerance factor","","1","","9","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Relieving hot spots in collaborative intrusion detection systems during worm outbreaks","C. V. Zhou; Shanika Karunasekera; C.

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load hot-spot, which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-2065-0;9781424420650","978-1-4244-2066-7;9781424420667","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Packet sampling for worm and botnet detection in TCP connections","L. Braun; G. M&#252;nz; G.

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201;15421201","978-1-4244-5366-5;9781424453665","978-1-4244-5367-2;9781424453672","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","1","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
