In order to continue their malevolent activities without being detected, cyber criminals make efforts to conceal the core servers (e.g., C&C servers, exploit servers, and drop-zone servers) in the malicious web infrastructure. Such deliberate invisibility of those concealed malicious servers, however, makes them particularly distinguishable from benign web servers that are usually promoted to be public. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study to investigate the visibility of both malicious and benign servers. From our intensive analysis of over 100,000 benign servers, 45,000 malicious servers and 40,000 redirections, we identify a set of distinct features of malicious web infrastructures from their locations, structures, roles, and relationships perspectives, and propose a lightweight yet effective detection system called VisHunter. VisHunter identifies malicious redirections from visible servers to invisible servers at the entryway of malicious web infrastructures. We evaluate VisHunter on both online public data and large-scale enterprise network traffic, and demonstrate that VisHunter can achieve an average 96.2% detection rate with only 0.9% false positive rate on the real enterprise network traffic.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524582","","Feature extraction;Indexes;Malware;Search engines;Superluminescent diodes;Web servers","","","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A harder problem to crack in the field of Network Security is the identification and prevention of attacks. An effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks.

Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning. We show that our approach improves accuracy over naive Markov chain and Kullback-Leibler divergence by boosting the number of particles, where probability density functions are highly nonlinear but partially known and can be determined using predictive importance sampling.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-5238-5;9781424452385","","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379782","","Complexity theory;Computer graphics;Information security;Intrusion detection;Particle filters;Probability density function;Protocols;Robustness;Spread spectrum communication;State estimation","Markov processes;ad hoc networks;communication complexity;importance sampling;military communication;mobile radio;sensor fusion;state estimation;telecommunication security","Byzantine behavior identification;Kullback-Leibler divergence;clustered intrusion detection architecture;efficient state estimation;multi-hop communication complexity;multisensor data;naive Markov chain;network partitioning;organizational boundaries;predictive importance sampling;probability density functions;tactical MANET;tactical mobile ad-hoc networks","","1","","20","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection of this type of attack at the network level can overcome the scalability issue of host-based detection methods. In this paper, we provide a machine learning approach for the detection of SSH brute force attacks at the network level. Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models. Our results show that the models built upon these features provide excellent performances for the detection of brute force attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424322","Aggregated Netflows;Brute Force;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Force;Intrusion detection","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","Netflow data;Netflow feature;SSH brute force attack traffic;SSH failed login data;SSH traffic;aggregated netflow data;campus network;computer network;discern brute force traffic;extracting discriminative feature;failed login traffic;host-based detection method;inspection;legitimate user;machine learning approach;machine learning model;machine learning task;network level;password combination;prevalent attack;representative collection","","","","21","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5;9781457700255","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy.

We propose to use the state of correlation between parameters to detect an attack. First we show how to select effective security parameters for our detection engine with statistical correlation methods. Then, we propose how to build correlation relation graphs (CRG) for the parameters showing higher correlation.

State-of-the-art IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of normal, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. The paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training. We show that using small detectors in a hierarchy gives a better result than a single large detector.

Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks.

It adds complementary results to previous works of the authors in order to better address dynamic policies. Previous works of the authors provide several advances for enforcing the security of MAC system.An administration language for formalizing a large set of security properties is available to system administrators. That language uses several flow operators and ease the formalization of the required security properties. A solution is also available for computing the possible violations of any security property that can be formalized using our language. That solution computes several flow graphs in order to find all the allowed activities that can violate the requested properties. That paper addresses remaining problems related to the enforcement of the same kind of properties but with dynamic MAC policies. Enforcement is more much complex if we consider dynamic policies since the states of those policies are theoretically infinite. A new approach is proposed for dynamic MAC policies. The major idea is to use a meta-policy language for controlling the allowed evolutions of those dynamic policies. According to those meta-policy constraints, the computation problem becomes easier. The proposed solution adds meta-nodes within the considered flow graphs. A general algorithm is given for computing the required meta-nodes and the associated arcs. The proposed meta-graphs provide an overestimation of the possible flows between the different meta-nodes. The computation of the possible violations within the allowed dynamic policies is thus allowed. Several concrete security properties are considered using regular expressions for identifying the requested meta-contexts. The resulting violations, within the allowed meta-graphs, are computed and real violations are presented.","2162-2108;21622108","978-0-7695-3668-2;9780769536682","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211030","","Access control;Concrete;Flow graphs;Information security;Linux;Mechanical factors;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Safety","authorisation;graph theory;telecommunication security","dynamic mandatory access control policies;flow graphs;meta-policy constraints;security properties fitting","","0","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little research work has been done in actually implementing such a scheme based on statistical methods. In this paper, we present an efficient anomaly detection algorithm based on a statistical method originated from pattern recognition, which can effectively identify abnormal behavior such as mobility pattern of MANETs. In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern. By comparing the mobility patterns with the training data, we can distinguish abnormal nodes from normal behavior nodes in mobile Ad Hoc networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of false alarm rate and detection rate for nodes with regular mobility patterns.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150901","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Scalability;Security;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;pattern recognition;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","MANET;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility patterns;mobility profile;multi-leaf tree structure;pattern recognition","","2","","13","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A data-based analysis for major industries is performed, where we map the maximum potential loss of a firm with the optimal cybersecurity budget size and discover that the optimal budget size is independent of the mix of assets that a firm holds. In addition, we also conclude that firms in finance, energy, and technology sectors should invest more in detective technologies than preventive, as oppose to even split in most other industries.

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1;9781467318891","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","2","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892;01962892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","94","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

However, anomaly based IDS are usually prone to high false positive rate due to difficulties involved in defining normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. In this paper, we employ two different statistical methods viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop new anomaly based IDS models. We then evaluate the performance of these IDS models on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set and analyze their performance against other IDS models based on Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the performance (Accuracy and Detection Rate) of both the LDA and the LR based models are at par and in some cases even better than other IDS models.

The objective is to detect the adversary as quickly as possible while satisfying certain detection error constraints. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is constructed to systematically analyze the proposed scheme.

To enhance security, various trust-based schemes have been proposed that augment traditional cryptography-based security schemes. However, most of them use static and predefined trust thresholds for node misbehavior detection, without taking into consideration the network conditions locally at each node. Using static thresholds for misbehavior detection may result in high false positives, low malicious node detection rate, and network partitioning. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Trust Threshold (ATT) computation strategy, that adapts the trust threshold in the routing protocol according to network conditions such as rate of link changes, node degree and connectivity, and average neighborhood trustworthiness. We identify the topology factors that affect the trust threshold at each node, and leverage them to build a mathematical model for ATT computation. Our simulation results indicate that the ATT strategy achieves significant improvements in packet delivery ratio, reduction in false positives, and increase in detection rate as compared to traditional static threshold strategies.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345347","MANETs;Trust-based security;adaptive threshold;static threshold;threshold computation","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Measurement;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Security","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","ATT computation strategy;MANETs;adaptive trust threshold strategy;cryptography-based security schemes;distributed architecture;dynamic network topology;high false positive reduction;low malicious node detection rate;mathematical model;misbehaving node detection;misbehaving node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;network partitioning;packet delivery ratio;predefined trust thresholds;routing protocol;static threshold strategy;trust-based schemes","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naive Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset. It is found that the fuzzy genetic algorithm with the fitness measure based on data mining support-confidence framework performs better compared to other fitness measure but in terms of classification Naive Bayesian technique is much more reliable.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073108","Classification;Fuzzy;Genetic Algorithm;Machine learning;Nave Bayes","Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Niobium;Pragmatics;Sociology;Training","Bayes methods;biology computing;combinatorial mathematics;data mining;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;proteins","Naive Bayesian approach;cellular localization sites;combinatorial optimization problem;data mining support-confidence framework;evolution process;evolutionary fuzzy genetic algorithm;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule based classification system;generalization capability;machine learning problems;multivariate dataset classification;pattern classification;pattern detection;performance analysis;proteins;soft-computing techniques;statistical techniques;yeast","","0","","15","","","22-23 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes.

Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM. Based on several models with different measures, fuzzy logic makes the final decision of whether current behavior is abnormal or not.

Taken in isolation, the individual parts of UNISON encompass features already present in existing systems and infrastructures, however, UNISON combines these into a consistent whole, providing data storage/distribution and messaging/control in a simple, light-weight and unified fashion. We have prototyped UNISON as a self-standing middleware platform, and have used the resulting prototype to support a (similarly prototypical) generic, autonomous cyber defence system from DST Group's HINDER project. We discuss our experiences with UNISON in the context of this system.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved cause and effect model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets.

"A novel scaleable architecture for intrusion detection and mitigation in switched networks","E. L. Witzke; T. D. Tarman; S. Ghosh; G. Woodard","Adv. Networking Integration Dept., Sandia Nat. Labs., Albuquerque, NM, USA","MILCOM 2002. Proceedings","20030225","2002","1","","395","399 vol.1","High-speed, switched networks present scalability challenges to a network intrusion detection system, both in terms of the volume of data that must be analyzed, and the extent to which sensors must be inserted into the switched network to achieve comprehensive visibility. An architecture that uses a single point for intrusion assessment would quickly become overwhelmed with incoming event data from intrusion sensors that are deployed on even a moderate number of high-speed links. This is particularly true if an earnest attack (generating many events in a short period of time) is underway. The authors propose a novel architecture that hierarchically distributes the assessment function into two assessment categories - tactical assessment, and strategic assessment. The tactical assessment function provides low-level event correlation and decision making for a small sub-network (e.g., a department LAN, an ATM switch peer group, etc.), and is capable of providing fast, real-time response when millisecond response times are required due to network attacks. The strategic assessment function, on the other hand, implements high-level event correlation, which is useful when a larger view of the network is required (e.g., for low intensity or distributed attacks). The tactical assessment engines interface to the strategic assessment engine by, filtering and summarizing low-level events, ensuring that the strategic assessment engine's workload remains manageable. This paper describes the distributed intrusion assessment architecture in more detail, presents a few application scenarios that benefit from hierarchical attack assessment, and summarizes ongoing work in developing prototype components for this architecture.","","0-7803-7625-0;0780376250","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1180474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180474","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision making;Delay;Engines;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Sensor systems;Switches","asynchronous transfer mode;correlation methods;local area networks;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM switch peer group;decision making;department LAN;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion assessment architecture;event data;filtering;high-level event correlation;high-speed links;high-speed switched networks;intrusion mitigation;intrusion sensors;low intensity attacks;low-level event correlation;network architecture;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;real-time response;scaleable architecture;strategic assessment engine;sub-network;tactical assessment engines","","3","","6","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","1","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized trust no peer mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a neighborhood watch concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","0-7803-7952-7;0780379527","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server.

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks.

This paper proposes an extension to a previously developed fuzzy logic based anomaly detection network security cyber sensor via incorporating Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (T2 FL). In general, fuzzy logic provides a framework for system modeling in linguistic form capable of coping with imprecise and vague meaning of words. T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness. In addition, the proposed algorithm was specifically developed to comply with the constrained computational requirements of low-cost embedded network security cyber sensors.

In response, ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to providing abundant information services to the public. With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of BusCast scheme.","1521-9097;15219097","","","10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097847","anonymous communication;backward unlinkability;message delivery;traffic analysis attacks;vehicular networks","Bismuth;Delays;Relays;Routing","data privacy;traffic engineering computing;transportation","BusCast scheme;ShanghaiGrid;information service;intelligent mobile device;message destination;privacy analysis;privacy information;privacy preserving message delivery;routing graph;routing scheme;trace-driven simulation;urban bus;urban traffic condition","","0","","16","","","16-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.","2165-9605;21659605","","","10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727844","Network search;distributed management;distributed query processing;innetwork management;matching and ranking","Databases;Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Search problems;Semantics;Web search","cloud computing;query processing","distributed query processing;echo protocol;network search queries;parallel processing;scalable matching;scalable ranking;search node","","3","","28","","","14-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2339-0;0769523390","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","8","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process.

Experiment results indicate that the proposed method is efficient.","","978-1-4244-5537-9;9781424455379","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563714","Association Rules;Data Mining;Intrusion Detection;Length-Decreasing Support;Rule-based","Data mining;Educational institutions;Itemsets","Internet;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;data mining;machine learning technology;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic data","","5","","4","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCADA systems with legacy communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems. The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally, proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are implemented and verified via Snort rules.","1932-5517;19325517","","","10.1109/PESMG.2013.6672100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6672100","Cyber-security;IEC 60870-5-104;Intrusion detection system;SCADA","IEC standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers","SCADA systems;power system security;protocols;safety systems;smart power grids","DPI method;IDS;IEC 60870-5-104;SCADA systems;Snort rules;cyber security vulnerabilities;cyber threats;deep packet inspection method;legacy communication infrastructure;malicious attackers;model-based detection;rule-based intrusion detection system;signature-based approaches;smart grids;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unknown attacks","","5","","14","","","21-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
