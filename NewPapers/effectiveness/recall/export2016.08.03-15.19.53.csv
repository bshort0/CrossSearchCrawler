Secure multiparty computation approaches provides a possible solution for computation time data protection, but are too costly (in communication) to be practical. In this paper, we design an adaptive multi-level secure computation algorithm with the goals of reducing the average communication overheads. The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected. Thus, the system yields better performance at normal execution time while still assures security protection at the presence of security threats.","1521-9097;15219097","0-7695-2281-5;0769522815","","10.1109/ICPADS.2005.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531105","","Communication system security;Computer science;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols;Scattering","information systems;protocols;security of data","adaptive multilevel secure computation;adaptive multiparty protocol;information systems;secure data protection;secure protocol","","2","","19","","","20-22 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other evolutionary-based techniques.","","978-1-4244-7859-0;9781424478590","978-1-4244-7857-6;9781424478576","10.1109/NAFIPS.2010.5548289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548289","evolutionary computation;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithms;network intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation","Internet;computer network;evolutionary based system;evolutionary optimization;fuzzy rule based network intrusion detection system;malicious agent;mobile network","","1","","18","","","12-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge. Experimental studies on intrusion detection and alert correlation problems show that our approach improves the performances on different benchmarks.","1082-3409;10823409","978-1-4799-0227-9;9781479902279","","10.1109/ICTAI.2012.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495080","Decision trees;alert correlation;expert knowledge;intrusion detection","Bayes methods;Context;Correlation;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution","decision trees;pattern classification;security of data;statistical distributions","alert correlation;classification problem;decision tree classifier;expert knowledge;intrusion detection;probability distribution;spam filtering","","0","","32","","","7-9 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The three tree approaches are: - Binary tree approach, weighted tree approach and Complex network approach. The binary tree approach directs user into a specified path, where the file gets a path value. In weighted tree approach user get four choices based on root value. Left or right sub tree is activated at a time based on the root value. User can select a value depends on the security of the file. In Complex network approach the full network is activate every time and user can select a value from eight different values.

These networks provide safety and comfort to passengers, drivers and vehicles themselves. These vehicles depend heavily on external communication to predicate the surrounding environment through the exchange of cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) and control data. VANETs are exposed to many types of attacks such as black hole, grey hole and rushing attacks. In this paper, we present an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which relies on anomaly detection to protect external communications from grey hole and rushing attacks. Many researchers agree that grey hole attacks in VANETs are a substantial challenge due to them having their distinct types of behaviour: normal and abnormal. These attacks try to prevent transmission between vehicles and roadside units and have a direct and negative impact on the wide acceptance of this new class of vehicles. The proposed IDS is based on features that have been extracted from a trace file generated in a network simulator. In our paper, we used a feed-forward neural network and a support vector machine for the design of the intelligent IDS. The proposed system uses only significant features extracted from the trace file. Our research, concludes that a reduction in the number of features leads to a higher detection rate and a decrease in false alarms.","","","","10.1109/CEEC.2015.7332730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332730","intrusion detection system;security;self-driving car;semi self-driving car;vehicular ad hoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Roads;Routing protocols;Vehicles","cooperative systems;feedforward neural nets;security of data;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","CAM;IDS;VANET;cooperative awareness messages;feedforward neural network;grey hole;intelligent intrusion detection system;rushing attacks;self-driving vehicular networks;semi self-driving vehicles;support vector machine;vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","20","","","24-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-Cyborg is to provide a solution that can assist network forensic in their cybercrime case. Based on several testing on the system simulation, the system is able to produce high quality of evidence. Hence, the investigation task becomes more efficient and effective.","","978-1-4799-1091-5;9781479910915","","10.1109/CITA.2013.6637579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637579","cybercrime;digital evidence;network forensic","Accuracy;Computer crime;Computers;Engines;Forensics","Internet;computer crime;digital forensics;firewalls;social networking (online)","E-Cyborg;IDS;Internet users;cyber evidence;cybercrime evidence finder;cybercriminal activity;evidence Cyborg;firewall system;intrusion detection system;network forensic;personal attack;physical crimes;social networking site","","2","","18","","","1-4 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transfer of the disturbance caused by the intruder significantly differs between both arms of the interferometer, causing a large phase shift for even the smallest of disturbances. This eliminates the need for complex opto-electronic demodulation schemes traditionally employed in interferometric signal interpretations.

In this work, we present a model for assessing cost of responses based on three factors, the cost of damage caused by the intrusion, the cost of automatic response to an intrusion and the operational cost. The proposed approach provides consistent basis for response assessment across different systems and environment. In addition, the performance analysis indicates that automated responses systems using this cost metric COSIRS, when deployed can responds quickly enough to thwart active attacks in real time using optimal responses.

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5;0780394275","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","2374-0221;23740221","978-1-4244-3337-7;9781424433377","","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","8","6","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks.

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252;15502252","978-1-4673-0989-9;9781467309899","978-1-4673-0988-2;9781467309882","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a novel framework for mining alerts of NIDS output report log for automatically predicting the severity of attack revealed by those alerts using data mining classification techniques. Our framework automatically detects the attack severity using the type of the suspicious traffic detected by NIDS as a feature. Hence it can save the time spent to manually analyze the log file of NIDS in order to categorize various types of captured suspicious traffic in view of the detected severity of attack. Moreover, it can help the network security administrator to create policy rules that take immediate action against the detected network attack based on its predicted severity.

We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach.

This leads to traffic overhead and wastage of bandwidth utilisation. In order to overcome these issues, ant-based DDoS detection technique using roaming virtual honeypots is proposed. In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470964","","","IP networks;ant colony optimisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","ant colony optimisation technique;ant-based DDoS detection technique;ant-based distributed denial-of-service detection technique;bandwidth utilisation wastage;defence system;intruder detection;multilevel IP log table;multilevel secure architecture;pheromone deposit;roaming virtual honeypots;traffic overhead","","","","","","","5 19 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

BEMSs control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems in buildings; more specifically, they control HVAC's primary components such as air handling units (AHUs), chillers, and heating elements. BEMSs are essential components of modern buildings, tasked with seemingly contradicting requirements?minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupants? comfort [1]. In the United States, about 40% of total energy consumption and 70% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings every year. These numbers are comparable to global statistics that about 30% of total energy consumption and 60% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings. Buildings are an integral part of global cyber-physical systems (smart cities) and evolve and interact with their surroundings. As buildings undergo years of exploitation, their thermal characteristics deteriorate, indoor spaces (especially in commercial buildings) get rearranged, and usage patterns change. In time, their inner (and outer) microclimates adjust to changes in surrounding buildings, overshadowing patterns, and city climates, not to mention building retrofitting. Thus, even in cases of ideally designed BEMS/HVAC systems, because of ever-changing and uncertain indoor and outdoor environments, their performance frequently falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, the complexity of BEMSs, large amounts of constantly changing data, and evolving interrelations among sensor feeds make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. Therefore, traditional data-mining algorithms and data-analysis tools are often inadequate.This article provides an overview of issues related to modern BEMSs with a multitude of (often con- licting) requirements. Because of massive and often incomplete data sets, control, sensing, and the evolving nature of these complex systems, computational intelligence (CI) techniques present a natural solution to optimal energy efficiency, energy security, and occupant comfort in buildings. The article further presents an overall architecture where CI can be used in BEMSs and concludes with a case study of the practical applications of using CI techniques in the BEMS domain.","1932-4529;19324529","","","10.1109/MIE.2015.2513749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436878","","Adaptation models;Buildings;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Resilience;Security;Smart grids","building management systems;energy management systems","HVAC system;access control;adaptive buildings;building automation systems;building control systems;building energy management systems;computational intelligence;fire safety;intelligent buildings;life safety;lighting system;physical security","","","","","","","Spring 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4673-6320-4;9781467363204","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

In this article, we investigated the various proposed schemes for packet drop attack and present a remarkable comparison among them. Finally, we have proposed a solution based on Rank Based Data Routing (RBDR) record to identify malicious behaviour in network.

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement.

This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces.

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2;9781424427772","978-1-4244-2778-9;9781424427789","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","23","3","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modelbased thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observed thermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies. As shown via experiments on a small-scale testbed as well as via trace-driven simulations, such model-based thermal anomaly detection solution in conjunction with TARA significantly improves the detection probability compared to anomaly detection when scheduling algorithms such as random, round robin, and best-fit-decreasing are employed.","2168-7161;21687161","","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2481423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274707","Anomaly detection;green datacenters;heat imbalance;high-performance computing;virtualization","Cooling;Heating;Histograms;Servers;Temperature measurement;Thermal sensors","","","","","","","","2015-09-23","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental result. In comparison to various types of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means.

However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.","2160-4886;21604886","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","10.1109/WiMob.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307","Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election","Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security","Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption","","2","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe a recent extension of the LSM framework that enables labeled network communication via IPsec that is now available in mainline Linux as of version 2.6.16. This functionality enables machines to control communication with processes on other machines based on the security label assigned to an IPsec security association.

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","3","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New rules are used to detect novel or known network attacks. A training and testing dataset proposed by DARPA is used to evolve and evaluate these new rules. The proof of concept implementation shows that the rule generated by GP has a low false positive rate (FPR), a low false negative rate (FNR) and a high rate of detecting unknown attacks. Moreover, the rule base composed of new rules has high detection rate (DR) with low false alarm rate (FAR).","","0-7803-7804-0;0780378040","","10.1109/CEC.2003.1299940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1299940","","Artificial intelligence;Biological cells;Data structures;Databases;Event detection;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Testing","authorisation;genetic algorithms;telecommunication security","DARPA;crossover;detection rate;dropping condition operators;false alarm rate;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic operators;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;mutation;network attacks;network intrusion;reproduction;rule evolution approach;testing dataset;training dataset","","3","","15","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RVM algorithm needs less relevance vectors (RVs) (support vectors (SVs) in SVM) and it has better generalization ability than SVM. In order to get better classifier in anomaly detection, we analyze and model RVM algorithm using KDD99 dataset. Firstly, the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors to enable better analysis of the data. Secondly, a multi-classification intrusion detection model based on relevance vector machine is designed to match these features. Finally, the matching forecast results of this model are achieved.

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","2166-5710;21665710","978-1-4244-0219-9;9781424402199","978-1-4244-0220-5;9781424402205","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","2155-7578;21557578","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","2","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack.

Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware.

We show that learning by teaching may reduce the query costs for teachers and allow for a proactive behavior of organic agents: Before certain situations emerge in their environment, they are already enabled to deal with that situations. We also show that learning by teaching may be problematic in cases where different agents are expected to have-at least partiallydifferent skills.

The use of an open wireless medium and unattended deployment leaves these systems vulnerable to intelligent adversaries whose goal is to disrupt the system performance. In this paper, we study the wormhole attack on a networked control system, in which an adversary establishes a link between two geographically distant regions of the network by using either high-gain antennas, as in the out-of-band wormhole, or colluding network nodes as in the in-band wormhole. Wormholes allow the adversary to violate the timing constraints of real-time control systems by first creating low-latency links, which attract network traffic, and then delaying or dropping packets. Since the wormhole attack reroutes and replays valid messages, it cannot be detected using cryptographic mechanisms alone. We study the impact of the wormhole attack on the network flows and delays and introduce a passivity-based control-theoretic framework for modeling and mitigating the wormhole attack. We develop this framework for both the in-band and out-of-band wormhole attacks as well as complex, hereto-unreported wormhole attacks consisting of arbitrary combinations of in-and out-of band wormholes. By integrating existing mitigation strategies into our framework, we analyze the throughput, delay, and stability properties of the overall system. Through simulation study, we show that, by selectively dropping control packets, the wormhole attack can cause disturbances in the physical plant of a networked control system, and demonstrate that appropriate selection of detection parameters mitigates the disturbances due to the wormhole while satisfying the delay constraints of the physical system.","0018-9286;00189286","","","10.1109/TAC.2014.2351871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882790","Cyber-physical systems;networked control systems;passivity;wireless networks;wormhole attack","Cryptography;Delays;Networked control systems;Resource management;Routing;Silicon","computer network security;cryptography;delays;networked control systems;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","cryptographic mechanisms;delay constraints;network flows;network traffic;networked control systems;packet delays;passivity framework;wireless network;wormhole attacks","","2","","19","","2014-08-28","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Solutions for perfectly secure authentication have been around much longer. Achieving perfect security, high availability and reliability, calls for combinations of various approaches. In this study, we propose a simple and uniform framework for the assessment of security, availability, and reliability that arbitrary compositions of security measures can provide. Our methodology facilitates system modeling in a decision-theoretic manner, which makes the models easily understandable even for specialists from fields other than security. At the same time, the models allow for strong assertions and for simple characterizations of the achievable security and safety in a system. We demonstrate the applicability of our results using quantum networks as an example.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499109","Decision theory;denial-of-service security;information-theoretic secrecy;quantum cryptography;reliability analysis","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Cryptography;Information analysis;Information security;Modeling;Quantum mechanics;Reliability theory;Safety","data integrity;data privacy;quantum cryptography;telecommunication network reliability","authenticity;availability analysis;confidentiality;information theoretic secrecy;quantum cryptographic device;quantum network;reliability analysis;secure authentication;security analysis;security measure;system security","","4","","44","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Bellovin","","Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN), 2010 Sixth International Conference on","20110217","2010","","","154","160","Doing route selection based in part on source addresses is a form of policy routing, which has started to receive increased amounts of attention. In this paper, we extend our previous work on ROLF (ROuting as the Firewall Layer) to achieve source prefix filtering. This permits easy definition of inside and outside, even in MANET environment where there is no topological boundary. We present algorithms for route propagation and packet forwarding using ROFL, we measure its performance in a simulated environment with two different ad hoc routing protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that ROFL can significantly reduce unwanted packets without extra control traffic incurred, and thus improves overall system performance and preserves battery power of mobile nodes. ROFL is the first scheme to provide a concrete defense against some battery exhaustion attacks in MANETs. Moreover, it requires only minor changes to existing ad hoc network routing protocols, making it practical and feasible to be deployed in real world.","","978-1-4244-9456-9;9781424494569","978-0-7695-4315-4;9780769543154","10.1109/MSN.2010.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714492","Firewall;MANETs;Policy Routing;Security","Ad hoc networks;IEEE news;Mobile computing;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","authorisation;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","MANET;battery exhaustion attacks;high performance firewalls;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;packet forwarding;policy routing;route propagation;route selection;routing as the firewall layer;routing protocols;source addresses;source prefix filtering","","3","","22","","","20-22 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection scheme is proposed, where Bayesian classification algorithm is used to detect anomalous nodes. By the tool NS2, a small number of samples are given and learned, and intrusion detection rules are built, network attack traffic is generated and simulated. And based on this, its detection rate, average detection rate, false positive rate and average false positive rate are evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the scheme achieves higher accuracy rate of detection and lower false positive rate than the current important intrusion detection schemes of WSN.","2160-1283;21601283","978-1-4244-4909-5;9781424449095","","10.1109/ICISE.2009.235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454700","","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Distributed computing;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian classification algorithm;NS2;WSN;anomaly detection scheme;average detection rate;average false positive rate;intrusion detection rule;machine learning;network attack traffic;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, a fusion model is constructed which contains network environment, network vulnerability, network attack, network security incident and sensor as key class. Secondly, three fusion rules which contain alert aggregation, alert verification and attack session reconstruction are formulated by using Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language. Finally, the application example shows that the method can make situation elements uniformly described. Security situation information has higher complementary and lower redundancy, which achieves better fusion effect.","","978-1-4799-7004-9;9781479970049","","10.1109/ISCID.2014.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081987","fusion;network security situation;ontology;rule","Communication networks;Fuses;OWL;Ontologies;Redundancy;Security;Semantics","computer network security;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;sensor fusion","alert aggregation;alert verification;attack session reconstruction;network attack;network environment;network security incident;network security situation element fusion method;network sensor;network vulnerability;ontology;semantic query-enhanced Web rule language","","1","","11","","","13-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
