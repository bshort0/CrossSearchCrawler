Changes to satisfy telecommunication needs within the technical community have surfaced gradually through the efforts of international computer standards organizations, technical panels, and guidance committees. The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another example of a security ap- - pliance. This network device employs security mechanisms such as tunneling, Internet protocol (IP) security protocols and cryptography. Insecure computer communications can have devastating consequences on national security, which would affect every aspect of daily life. To address the issue a secure computer communications architecture will be offered as an example to demonstrate the precautions that can be taken, display the benefits from a systems engineering viewpoint and present an economic feasibility with a view towards the future","2155-7195;21557195","1-4244-0377-4;1424403774","1-4244-0378-2;1424403782","10.1109/DASC.2006.313729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106339","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Cryptographic protocols;Information security;National security;Protection;Telecommunication computing;Virtual private networks","aircraft communication;computer communications software;security of data;virtual private networks","aerospace communication;computer security;firewall system installation;intrusion detection techniques;secure computer communications architecture;virtual private networks","","0","1","17","","","15-19 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","1","","56","","2015-02-10","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It involves optimization over a different objective and a doubled set of Lagrange multipliers. One might consider our approach as a joint estimation of the support for different probability distributions per class where an ultimate goal is to separate classes with the largest possible angle between the normal vectors to the decision hyperplanes in the feature space.

IEEE International Conference on","20090119","2008","","","156","163","The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.","1063-6404;10636404","978-1-4244-2657-7;9781424426577","978-1-4244-2658-4;9781424426584","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855","","Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory","","2","","25","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We enumerate the properties a thumbprint needs to have to work in practice, and then define a class of local thumbprints which have the desired properties. A methodology from multivariate statistics called principal component analysis is used to infer the best choice of thumbprinting parameters from data. Currently our thumbprints require 24 bytes per minute per connection. We develop an algorithm to compare these thumbprints which allows for the possibility that data may leak from one time-interval to the next.

We have developed an algorithm that tracks multiple (n) characteristics per flow, and requires updating only the flow's n values upon an event, not all the values for all the flows. The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them. Our results show that this algorithm is efficient in space and compute time, is resilient against anomalies in the flow, and has uses outside of stepping stone detection.","0742-1303;07421303","0-7695-3000-1;0769530001","978-0-7695-3000-0;9780769530000","10.1109/LCN.2007.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4367884","correlation algorithms;flow correlation;stepping stone detection","Computer networks;Contracts;Detection algorithms;Euclidean distance;Event detection;Military computing;Multicast protocols;Timing;Transmitters;US Government","security of data","Euclidean distance;correlation matrix;multi-dimensional flow correlation;stepping stone detection","","3","","20","","","15-18 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels. Prototype relays on a hybrid detection and evolutionary summarizing schemes The viability of the two schemes has been confirmed trough experiments considering different attack distributions and types.","","978-1-4799-1426-5;9781479914265","","10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663006","Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","attack distributions;attack types;evolutionary summarizing scheme;human effort reduction;hybrid detection scheme;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection;network traffic model generation;prototype relays","","0","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model.

SDN enables the networks to be programmed according to the user requirements; furthermore, it allows the network to be easily modified to suit transient demands. However, how do we program the network? SDN-compliant switches offer a low-level interface that makes programming error-prone. The controllers provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but still low-level, limited and inflexible. Highlevel languages have the potential to be a better alternative to program the network. There exist several SDN programming languages implementing different sets of functionalities, and focusing on solving various issues. In face of all this diversity, no published paper outlines a pragmatic view allowing to compare the SDN languages. This paper presents a systematic survey of up-to-date OpenFlow-based SDN programming languages. Our approach relies on a taxonomy comprising all prominent features found in those languages. A detailed review of the existing works is carried out investigating the foundational parts of the languages with their contributions. Examples are discussed to illustrate the fundamental abstractions. Lastly, all gathered information is summarized, discussing the main ongoing research efforts and challenges.

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers. We carried out theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard for discovery, blocking, and traceback of malicious traffic.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2465934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182328","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor;intrusion detection system;malicious traffic","Bandwidth;Law;Logic gates;Malware;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;digital forensics;invasive software;law;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;TorWard;administrative complaints;botnet traffic;denial-of-service attack traffic;dual-tone multifrequency signaling-based approach;forensic traceback;intrusion detection system;legal complaints;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic traceback;malware traffic;spam;suspect connections;university campus","","0","","55","","2015-08-07","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, every intrusion detection approach has been limited by their problems: signature-based intrusion detection can identify the known intrusions but cannot detect the novel intrusions, anomaly-based intrusion detection has the potential to detect all intrusions but has the limitation of a higher false alarm rate. For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, it is also found that static analysis (Wagner, et al., 2001), with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495951","","Access control;Authentication;Computational efficiency;Computer applications;Face detection;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling","digital signatures;feature extraction;program diagnostics","anomaly-based intrusion detection;behavior model;feature vector;information security infrastructure;model inaccuracy;model incompleteness;signature-based intrusion detection;static analysis","","4","1","27","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","2","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Security Implications of Data Mining in Cloud Scheduling","C. Delimitrou; C. Kozyrakis","","IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","","2015","PP","99","1","1","Cloud providers host an increasing number of popular applications, on the premise of resource flexibility and cost efficiency. Most of these systems expose virtualized resources of different types and sizes. As instances share the same physical host to increase utilization, they contend on hardware resources, e.g., last-level cache, making them vulnerable to side-channel attacks from co-scheduled applications. In this work we show that using data mining techniques can help an adversarial user of the cloud determine the nature and characteristics of co-scheduled applications and negatively impact their performance through targeted contention injections. We design Bolt, a simple runtime that extracts the sensitivity of co-scheduled applications to various types of interference and uses this signal to determine the type of these applications by applying a set of data mining techniques. We validate the accuracy of Bolt on a 39-server cluster. Bolt correctly identifies the type and characteristics of 81% out of 108 victim applications, and constructs specialized contention signals that degrade their performance. We also use Bolt to find the most commonly-run applications on EC2. We hope that underlining such security vulnerabilities in modern cloud facilities will encourage cloud providers to introduce stronger resource isolation primitives in their systems.","1556-6056;15566056","","","10.1109/LCA.2015.2461215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167661","Scheduling and task partitioning;Security and privacy protection;Super (very large) computers","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Data mining;Degradation;Fasteners;Interference;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-07-27","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules.

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware.

Hence, the devising of mechanisms that reassure the integrity of the exchanged data is of utmost importance. In this article we investigate how tweaked information originating from malicious nodes can affect the performance of a real time eco-routing mechanism that uses Dedicated Short Ranged Communications (DSRC), namely Erou Ve.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the big-dataism. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.","","","","10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML","Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering","Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining","","0","","24","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9;9781479964529","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","4","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073-0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559609","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6;9781424476756","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","24","3","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DTNs are vulnerable to insider attacks, in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary nodes launch blackhole attacks by dropping packets in the networks. The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect insider attacks by analyzing these packet delivery records. We evaluated our approach through extensive simulations using both Random Way Point and Zebranet mobility models.

The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented.

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.","1092-1648;10921648","","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733610","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Middleboxes;Radiation detectors;Round robin;Schedules;Time complexity","computational complexity;queueing theory;scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","WAN optimization;application level firewall;dominant resource fairness;elastic round robin;intrusion detection system;low complexity packet scheduler;multiple middlebox resources;multiresource fair queueing scheme;multiresource round robin;packet processing;time complexity;traffic flow","","5","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2252-1;0769522521","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1092-1648;10921648","978-1-4244-1587-8;9781424415878","978-1-4244-1588-5;9781424415885","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","13","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA. The Amazon security model has been reviewed for this purpose both for archiving and disaster recovery.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","2166-9570;21669570","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6666573","","Cognitive radio;Noise;Principal component analysis;Probability;Resilience;Security;Sensors","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","CRAWDAD data repository;catastrophic performance degradation;cognitive radio networks;denial of service;genuine node failures;intelligent jamming;multidimensional cooperative spectrum sensing technique;multiple criteria analysis technique;nonparametric Bayesian inference method;physical layer;primary user emulation;spectrum holes;spectrum usage efficiency","","0","","16","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning.

Computational power and valuable resources are wasted when the irrelevant data is processed, data flagged, analyst alerted, and the irrelevant data is finally disregarded.

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network.

An adaptive mutation rate is applied, and the mutation type is selected heuristically from weight adaptation, node deletion and node addition.

Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2368363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949097","Correlated Dataset;Differential Privacy;Non-IID Dataset;Privacy Preserving;Privacy preserving;correlated dataset;differential privacy;non-IID dataset","Correlation;Couplings;Data privacy;Histograms;Noise;Privacy;Sensitivity","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;iterative methods","correlated data releasing mechanism;correlated data set;correlated differential privacy solution;correlated information;correlated iteration mechanism;correlated levels;correlated sensitivity;data mining;data release;influential privacy notion;information hiding;iterative method;non-IID data set;privacy guarantee;privacy preserving;privacy violation;traditional global sensitivity","","0","","17","","2014-11-06","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The experiment with attack features and legitimate features is conducted and it provides 100% accuracy rate for both attack data and legitimate data.","","978-1-4799-3758-5;9781479937585","","10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092165","Schonlau dataset;covariance matrix;feature extraction;masquerade detection","Accuracy;Computers;Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training;Training data","covariance matrices;security of data","attack data;computer abuse;covariance matrices;covariance matrix method;intrusion detection;legitimate data;legitimate user computer;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","0","","14","","","6-8 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Self-Healing, Self-Protecting Collaborative Intrusion Detection Architecture to Trace-Back Fast-Flux Phishing Domains","C. V. Zhou; C. Leckie; S. Karunasekera; T. Peng","Dept. of Comput.

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","978-1-4244-2067-4;9781424420674","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","5","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
