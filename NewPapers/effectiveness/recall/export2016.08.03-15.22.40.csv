Although IP Geolocation is an ongoing field of research for over one decade, it is still a challenging task, whereas good results are only achieved by the use of active latency measurements. Nevertheless, an increased accuracy is needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to find optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a reasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization service, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the infrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an adaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical location estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about solving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models. We demonstrate the usability of our approach in a real-world environment and analyse Geolocation for the first time in Europe.

IDS can use signatures or abnormal behaviors to detect attacks. When IDS uses signatures, in order to detect more attacks, we have to implement more attack signatures on IDS. However, in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks, it is not efficient to implement all of attack signatures. And it is hard to maintain attack signature database because it should be updated frequently when new kind of attacks appear. In this paper, we propose a distributed IDS mechanism which reduces the usage of memory and overhead.

However, the security model in wired networks is not suited for WSNs because of their energy constraints. In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS. The simulation results show that our ADS is able to achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283101","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Gene expression;Hidden Markov models;Mathematics;Predictive models;Programming profession;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","genetic algorithms;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;time series;wireless sensor networks","GEP-ADS algorithm;GEP-based lightweight anomaly detection scheme;WSN trust;energy constraint;energy consumption;gene expression programming;intrusion detection scheme;routing attack;security model;simulation result;time series method;traffic prediction model;wired network;wireless sensor network reliability","","0","","16","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the DOS attack evolves the cross-correlations rise thus revealing the attack. CIDS relies on changes in correlation magnitude upon shifting from normal to attack conditions, thus it is an anomaly type intrusion detection system (IDS). However it is characterized by several advantages over anomaly IDS, primarily due to the fact that it greatly reduces and/or eliminates the need to maintain normal reference profiles. Thus CIDS (1) is algorithmically simple; (2) consumes less computational and storage resources; (3) is faster in execution; (4) promises to be more robust; and, (5) is conceptually simple, thus promises to be easier to maintain. By detecting abnormal conditions, CIDS also promises to detect novel as well as known attacks, an important advantage over signature based systems. Moreover, it achieves satisfactory misclassification rates, as demonstrated by the application of the scheme to the DARPA'98 corpus of intrusion attacks, namely false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates of 0 and 0.0605, respectively, and overall missclassification rate of 0.0011.","","0-7803-8219-6;0780382196","","10.1109/SARNOF.2004.1302842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302842","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","authorisation;computer network management;correlation methods","CIDS;Correlation Intrusion Detection System;DARPA'98 corpus;DoS attacks;anomaly type IDS;computer network;denial-of-service attacks;false negative rates;false positive rates;feature cross-correlation;intrusion detection system;misclassification rates;novel attacks","","2","","3","","","26-27 Apr 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9;9781467319119","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time the number of network threats and attacks of various types in private and corporate networks is constantly increasing. Therefore, the development of effective methods of intrusion detection is an urgent problem at the present day. In this paper we propose a new approach to intrusion detection in computer networks based on the use of neural networks ensembles. This approach can be implemented in distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) which better meets the challenges of the present time, in contrast to the traditional use of neural networks in host-based IDS. In the paper the basic steps of the neural networks ensembles designing are described and some of the methods to complete these steps are expounded.

Denial-of-service attacks have been successful in denying legitimate traffic access to its required resources because existing routing protocols treat the attacking traffic equally as any normal traffic. This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic. We demonstrate through several examples, how our approach can dynamically detect attacks, quantify their impact, and how to reduce the impacts and recover from them.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514527","Abnormality distance (AD);network attack;proactive defense;quality-of-protection (QoP)","Computer crime;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;Internet;authorisation;fault diagnosis;monitoring;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AD metric;Internet infrastructure;QoP;QoS protocol;abnormality distance;automatic technique;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;network fault;network traffic flow;online monitoring;proactive defense network;quality-of-protection;quality-of-service;routing protocol;self-protection mechanism","","8","1","59","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device.

After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets. This paper focuses on the immune agents' initialization, detection, evolution and update strategies.

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition.

Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls.

Furthermore, the static model is no longer appropriate due to the fluctuation nature of the number of alerts incurred by Internet traffic fluctuation nature.

Our classifier is based an online self-trained SVM algorithm with several learning strategies and execution modes.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement.

In this article, we conceive a novel conceptual network security mechanism, the evolving defense mechanism (EDM), to resolve current and future security problems. EDM is based on a bio-inspired idea of network configuration variations. According to the security requirements of the system, the user, and the network security state, EDM selects an efficient network configuration variation strategy to prevent corresponding security threats. Combined with SDN implementation, EDM resolves security problems from a new angle and is capable of evolving with new network security technology. We sketch a way to implement EDM and present its reference framework, which serves as an ecosystem and coexisting environment for various kinds of network configuration variations.

Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification.

In this paper, we propose log template extraction (LTE), an approach that is semantics aware of network and security logs to address the problem. LTE first cleans log messages and then clusters the cleaned log messages based on the DBSCAN algorithm. At last it infers message templates by LDA Gibbs sampling algorithm.

Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

In order to achieve the classification, Intrusion detection systems use software computing techniques including neural networks and neuro fuzzy networks to categorize network activities and specify what category of attack is being generated. Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results. Genetic algorithms use a set of genetic operators such as mutation, crossover and selection on current population to reproduce similar patterns that will be used repeatedly until a particular criterion is met.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888688","ANFIS;Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neuro-Fuzy","Biological cells;Filtering;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Training","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;security of data","ANFIS;IDS systems;data classification;fuzzy inference systems;genetic algorithms;intelligent intrusion detection system;neural networks;neuro-fuzzy classifiers;software computing techniques","","0","","20","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011;10816011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected adhoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. In addition, new history based routing schemes e.g. Prophet have been proposed because traditional adhoc routing schemes do not work well in sparse ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks that use Prophet as their routing scheme. Via simulations, we study the effectiveness of the FBIDM scheme when malicious nodes launch selective data dropping attacks. Our results with different mobility models, ferry speed, traffic load scenarios indicate that the FBIDM scheme is promising in reducing the impact of such malicious attacks.","","978-1-4244-1024-8;9781424410248","978-1-4244-1025-5;9781424410255","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451068","DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networks;intrusion detection;prophet;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;History;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","data dropping attacks;ferry-based intrusion detection;history based routing schemes;mobile ad hoc networks;sparsely connected ad hoc networks","","10","","20","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To resolve this problem, this paper proposed a novel distributed negative selection algorithm based on the original negative selection algorithm. The core of this distributed negative selection algorithm is the distributing strategy. Two kinds of distributing strategies, random distributing strategy and greedy distributing strategy are given. Then we compared the performance of random distributing strategy and greedy distributing strategy. The experimental results show that: (1) distributed negative selection algorithm can avoid the problem of single point failure, when a part of detection workstations fails, the detection rate does not descend quickly; and (2) when some detection workstations fail, greedy distributing strategy can maintain better detection rate than random distributing strategy.","","981-04-7524-1;9810475241","","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1202865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202865","","Biological system modeling;Biological systems;Change detection algorithms;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Workstations","distributed processing;random processes;security of data","biological system;distributed intrusion detection;distributed negative selection algorithm;greedy distributing strategy;negative selection algorithm;single point failure","","0","","12","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server. By correlating different streams of events, it is possible to achieve more effective detection of Web-based attacks.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254308","","Application software;Computer hacking;Computer science;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Web sites;computer crime;file servers","Web-based applications;Web-based attacks;WebSTAT intrusion detection system;World-Wide Web servers;operating system-level audit data;server host;sophisticated attack languages","","26","2","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots. Being able to identify scanning activities will allow security analysts to focus more on other types of traffic, and hence be able to study and analyze other types of attacks.","","978-1-4577-0975-3;9781457709753","978-0-7695-4482-3;9780769544823","10.1109/CICSyN.2011.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005682","Data Mining;Honeynet;Intrusion Detection;Scanning","Data mining;Feature extraction;IP networks;Machine learning;Probes;Servers;Time series analysis","alarm systems;computerised monitoring;data mining;security of data","Honey pots;Honeynet data;aggregate traffic data;business;data mining;early warning system;enumeration activity;financial benefits;hacker origin;malicious activity tracking;open services;production network scanning activity;security analysts;unauthorized access;vulnerable software","","0","","23","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","AhoCorasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm.

This paper proposes a new framework to detect anomalies and to provide early alerts for flooding attacks in backbone networks.

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA.

It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our AEC includes two stages: the online stage and the offline stage, and three phases: classifier updating, ensemble classifiers reconstruction and component classifier subset selection for final decision. We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination of which may yield better accuracy to make classification. Experiment justifies the superiority of our model in both accuracy and sensitivity in the concept drifting environment.","","978-1-4244-2765-9;9781424427659","","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938631","","Bagging;Buffer storage;Computers;Content addressable storage;Decision making;Decision trees;History;Internet;Intrusion detection;Training data","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","adaptive ensemble classifier;concept drifting stream classification;ensemble reconstruction;incremental learner;naive Bayes classifier;online bagging classification","","1","","15","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Nong Ye; Yebin Zhang; C. M. Borror","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","IEEE Transactions on Reliability","20040405","2004","53","1","116","123","Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","41","3","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations. The simulation results show both the correctness of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2019154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815406","Game theory;Nash equilibrium (NE);intrusion detection system (IDS)","","game theory;security of data","Nash equilibrium;game theoretical analysis;heterogeneous networks;intrusion detection systems;noncooperative game;optimal strategy;security infrastructure","","22","","14","","2009-04-17","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","13","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
