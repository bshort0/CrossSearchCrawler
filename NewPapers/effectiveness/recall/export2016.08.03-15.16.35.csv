Most of the current virus detection approaches, such as anti-virus tools, require precognition of virus signatures for detection, but they are hard to detect unknown virus. In this paper, we present a new immunity based virus detection approach. This approach collects arguments of process calls instead of the sequence of process, which obtain more information of process, and then utilizes them to train detectors with real-valued negative selection (RVNS) algorithm. In the stage of testing, user feedback is analyzed to adjust the threshold between normal files and viruses. We took two experiments to evaluate the performance of the approach, and the detection rate achieved is 0.7, which proved this approach could cope with unknown virus.","","978-963-9799-05-9;9789639799059","978-963-9799-05-9;9789639799059","10.1109/BIMNICS.2007.4610081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4610081","Artificial Immune System;Process Call Arguments;Real-valued Negative Selection;User Feedback;Virus Detection","Artificial immune systems;Computer science;Detectors;Educational institutions;Feedback;Immune system;Object detection;Permission;Testing;Viruses (medical)","artificial immune systems;computer viruses","anti-virus tools;artificial immune system;immunity based virus detection;process call arguments;real-valued negative selection algorithm;user feedback;virus signatures precognition","","0","","24","","","10-12 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response to this problem Pattern Based Algorithm is proposed which has high detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. In this algorithm decision stumps are used as weak classifier. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. Weak classifier for continuous features and weak classifier for categorical features are combined to form a strong classifier.

Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used.

Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate.

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification.

The case study presented starts with a multi-attribute risk assessment that results in a prioritized list of risks. Security specialists estimate countermeasure benefits and how the organization's risks are reduced. Using SAEM, security design alternatives are compared with the organization's current selection of security technologies to see if a more cost-effective solution is possible.

Day by day new vulnerabilities are detected in networking and computer products that lead to new emerging problems. One of the new prevention techniques for network threats is Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Feature selection is the major challenging issues in IDS in order to reduce the useless and redundant features among the attributes (e.g. attributes in KDD cup'99, an Intrusion Detection Data Set). In this paper, we aim to reduce feature vector space by calculating distance relation between features with Information Measure (IM) by evaluating the relation between feature and class to enhance the feature selection. Here we incorporate the Information Measure (IM) method with k-means Cluster Triangular Area Based Support Vector Machine (CTSVM) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to detect intrusion attacks. By dealing with both continuous and discrete attributes, our proposed method extracts best features with high Detection Rate (DR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).","2377-6927;23776927","978-1-4673-0670-6;9781467306706","","10.1109/ICoAC.2011.6165213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165213","Detection Rate;False Positive Rate;Information Measure;Intrusion Detection;Support Vector Machine;k-means Clustering","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Training","pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","SVM classifier;attacker threat;continuous attribute;detection rate;discrete attribute;false positive rate;feature selection;feature vector space;information measure;intrusion detection;k-means cluster triangular area based support vector machine;network based application;security threat;support vector machines;threat prevention technique;triangle SVM;vulnerability detection","","1","","15","","","14-16 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can establish pairwise keys with other clients after mesh routers broadcast public matrices. Our scheme is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. Besides, we employ the pre deployment knowledge to reduce the computational cost of mesh clients.

Most of our crucial data is stored in a computer system and in most cases we exchange it over a network. But it's not just our data transmitting over the network but different types of attacks too. These attacks can harm our stored data. Monitoring computer system and its logs (administration logs, security logs, system logs, network logs) and protecting our crucial data is necessary. For these necessities we use intrusion detection system. An intrusion detection system is an application that provides protection from malicious activities or policy violations and generates various rules to defend computer security. Intrusion detection system can be designed and developed on any platform but for its better functionality we are using data mining technique. In past years, many techniques have been introduced to improvise the detection rate. Earlier, in the initial stages of its designing, hardware had to be installed to detect and monitor the system. But, with the help of data mining it has become easier to work with software and algorithm development. In the recent trends, many new algorithms have been introduced to increase its efficiency. They are categorized under machine learning algorithms: supervised, unsupervised and hybrid. Though hybrid has not yet been categorized finely but various authors have used it by merging different machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms provide a process of detecting intrusion and generating rules for its detection and prevention. Rule generation is defined by association rule mining and apriori algorithm. An intrusion detection system is not a new application but developing a prototype which will work for the saved logs (administration logs, security logs and system logs) and monitor network logs on host system as well as on client system, so that the Intrusion detection system can alert the user on regular basis, is. In this paper we are using a hybrid ma- hine learning algorithm following with rule generation algorithm to detect the intrusion in the network logs by training KDD dataset. Training and Testing KDD data set provides the way of analyzing the actual behavior and predicted behavior of the network logs. This paper shows the methodology and results in Netbeans IDE 8.1(Java platform using Weka library). Through the obtained results, it can be interpreted that optimal performance is obtained against most attacks after detection.","","978-1-4673-7230-5;9781467372305","","10.1109/ICRITO.2015.7359266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359266","IDs;apriori algorithm;association rule;hybrid approach;supervised approach;unsupervised approach","Computers;Security","data mining;data protection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","KDD dataset;Netbeans IDE 8.1;apriori algorithm;association rule mining;computer security;computer system monitoring;data mining;data mining technique;data protection;hybrid machine learning algorithm;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;rule generation","","","","16","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.","","978-1-4673-1937-9;9781467319379","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119","Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting","Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model","","0","","32","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6;9781424498796","978-0-7695-4330-7;9780769543307","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","2","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator.

Combining the geodesic projection to the spherical decision boundary resulting from the SVDD, together with solving the preimage problem, we propose a new method for pattern denoising.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002;15506002","978-1-4244-8078-4;9781424480784","978-0-7695-4131-0;9780769541310","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","1","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount.

In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset.

In mobile ad-hoc networks, data transmission is performed within an untrusted wireless environment. The lack of centralized infrastructure in ad-hoc network makes it vulnerable to various attacks. Wormhole attack is one of the most severe attacks with mobile ad-hoc networks. In wormhole attack, a malicious node records data packets at one location in the network and tunnels them to another malicious node far away, which retransmits them into the network locally. Some of the researchers have proposed many solutions for wormhole attack. In this paper an efficient method to detect a wormhole attack called modified wormhole detection AODV protocol has been proposed. Detection of wormhole attack is performed using number of hops in different paths from source to destination and delay of each node in different paths from source to destination. The destination is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. The performance of modified wormhole detection AODV protocol is justified by simulations.","","978-1-4799-0190-6;9781479901906","","10.1109/IC3.2013.6612197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612197","Ad-hoc networks;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole attack","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAODV;centralized infrastructure;data packets;data transmission;malicious node;mobile ad-hoc networks;wireless mobile hosts;wormhole attack;wormhole detection AODV protocol","","1","","12","","","8-10 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For reasons of privacy and confidentiality, no one wants to expose their sensitive data to the research community. Data can be sanitized to mitigate privacy and confidentiality concerns, but the mere act of sanitizing the data may introduce artifacts that compromise its utility for research purposes. If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy. We establish that two of the three sanitization strategies actually alter the results of the experiment. Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research.

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

In particular, the analysis is focusing on the maximum sensing range in terms of azimuth angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. With the help of IoT, sensor which detected motion on weak detection angle or signal could communicate through internet and get signal from nearby sensor for better detection signal. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB100 which detect movement using Doppler effects. Octopus II will uplink all signal through internet and provide corresponding action of virtual fencing when intrusion detected. Results show maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing.

There are some limitations such as reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect sensor nodes. These limitations mostly affect the security of wireless networks. Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for detecting and monitoring selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks. The new approach guaranteed to keep the data transferring between nodes safely.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2016.7494104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7494104","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Bandwidth;Hardware;Heat transfer;Monitoring;Reliability;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;energy efficiency;environmental monitoring;healthcare;malicious nodes function;military surveillance;networks layer;security attacks;selective forwarding attack;sensor nodes;traffic surveillance;wireless sensor networks","","","","13","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-2161-4;0769521614","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. Finally, the intrusion detection method is evaluated through simulation experiments.","","","","10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60163-2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072389","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocol;security;timed automata","Automata;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","","","","Aug. 2008","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

STIX ontology, which was developed by taking advantage of existing cyber security related standards, is used to represent cyber threat information and infer important features of the cyber situation that help decision makers form their situational awareness. However, due to the widespread application of information technology, security analysts face a challenge in information overload. There are still huge volumes of low level observations captured by various sensors and network tools that need to be used to derive the high level intelligence queries such as potential courses of action and future impact. Therefore, identification of the relevant cyber threat information for a specific query is a crucial procedure for cyber situation assessment. In this paper, we leverage the STIX ontology to represent cyber threat information in a logical framework.

The system was exposed to severe climatic changes throughout the test period. During the test period the system did not generate any false alarms. It was unaffected by high waves, high winds, small birds, leaves, or partial shielding of one sensor by foliage.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sometimes, however, they have exploitable weaknesses, allowing an adversary to bypass them in different ways. Therefore, their design should include improved resilience capabilities to allow them to operate correctly in highly adverse environments. This paper proposes SieveQ, a message queue service that protects and regulates the access to critical systems, in a way similar to an application-level firewall. SieveQ achieves fault and intrusion tolerance by employing an architecture based on two filtering layers, enabling efficient removal of invalid messages at early stages and decreasing the costs associated with Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication of previous solutions. Our experimental evaluation shows that SieveQ improves existing replicated-firewalls resilience in the presence of corrupted messages by faulty nodes. Furthermore, it accommodates high loads, as it is able to handle sixteen times more security events per second than what was processed by the SIEM employed in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2016.2593442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517292","Application-level firewall;BFT;Denial-of-service;Intrusion Tolerance","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Protocols;Receivers;Resilience","","","","","","","","2016-07-20","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods.

Particularly, high dimensionality reduction is achieved without sacrificing the prediction performance for energy consumption, temperature, price and people's presence prediction. Only for thermal discomfort prediction, high dimensionality reduction causes small increase of mean average prediction error typically less than 1%.

In the mean time, applying artificial intelligence to intrusion tolerant system can adaptively adjust and learn according to the extent of damage caused by attack. Establishing behavioral database was proposed for the first time. This method can avoid updating a large number of virus database frequently, realize the coordinative detection and early warning among the different servers and further improves the ability for computer to prevent and process the viruses.","","978-1-4244-4507-3;9781424445073","978-1-4244-4507-3;9781424445073","10.1109/CISE.2009.5365354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5365354","","Artificial immune systems;Artificial intelligence;Computer security;Computer viruses;Data security;Databases;Humans;Immune system;Pathogens;Resists","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;authorisation;computer viruses","adaptive intrusion tolerance strategy;artificial immune;artificial intelligence;computer virus;security service","","0","","8","","","11-13 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is important to properly handle network and Web database security issues including authentication, denial of service, and fine-grained access control. When database access control and the network security are addressed separately, the security systems are not optimized sufficiently as a whole. This paper propose a method of integrating network security with criterion based access control to handle network security and the fine-grained Web database access control simultaneously. To improve efficiency, the model adopts two step access controls. The first preliminary access control is combined with the firewall function, and the second fine-grained access decisions are determined by the user's digital credentials as well as other factors such as his/her IP address.","","978-0-7695-3643-9;9780769536439","","10.1109/ISECS.2009.191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209852","","Access control;Authentication;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Distributed databases;Information security;Permission;Protection","Internet;authorisation;distributed databases","Internet;Intranet;Web database security;authentication;denial of service;distributed database;fine-grained access control;fine-grained database access control model;security systems;unified network security","","2","","25","","","22-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These efforts have been enriched through a formal approach, e.g., the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) framework, which is discussed in two earlier volumes in this series. This volume should help advance work not only in DLs, but also in the WWW and other information systems. Drawing upon four (Kozievitch, Murthy, Park, Yang) completed and three (Elsherbiny, Farag, Srinivasan) in-process dissertations, as well as the efforts of collaborating researchers and scores of related publications, presentations, tutorials, and reports, this book should advance the DL field with regard to at least six key technologies. By integrating surveys of the state-of-the-art, new research, connections with formalization, case studies, and exercises/projects, this book can serve as a computing or information science textbook. It can upport studies in cyber-security, document management, hypertext/hypermedia, IR, knowledge management, LIS, multimedia, and machine learning. Chapter 1, with a case study on fingerprint collections, focuses on complex (composite, compound) objects, connecting DL and related work on buckets, DCC, and OAI-ORE. Chapter 2, discussing annotations, as in hypertext/hypermedia, emphasizes parts of documents, including images as well as text, managing superimposed information. The SuperIDR system, and prototype efforts with Flickr, should motivate further development and standardization related to annotation, which would benefit all DL and WWW users. Chapter 3, on ontologies, explains how they help with browsing, query expansion, focused crawling, and classification. This chapter connects DLs with the Semantic Web, and uses CTRnet as an example. Chapter 4, on (hierarchical) classification, leverages LIS theory, as well as machine learning, and is important for DLs as well as the WWW. Chapter 5 on extraction from text, covers document segmentation, as well as how to construct a database from heterogeneous collections of references (from ETDs); i.e., converting strings to canonical forms. Chapter 6 surveys the security approaches used in information systems, and explains how those approaches can apply to digital libraries which are not fully open. Given this rich content, those interested in DLs will be able to find solutions to key problems, using the right technologies and methods. We hope this book will help show how formal approaches can enhance the development of suitable technologies and how they can be better integrated with DLs and other information systems.","","9781627050319","","10.2200/S00566ED1V01Y201401ICR033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813167.pdf&bkn=6813166&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2014","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

This paper describes a technique of applying artificial immune system along with genetic algorithm to develop an intrusion detection system. Far from developing primary immune response, as most of the related works do, it attempts to evolve this primary immune response to a secondary immune response using the concept of memory cells prevalent in natural immune systems. A genetic algorithm using genetic operators- selection, cloning, crossover and mutation- facilitates this. Memory cells formed enable faster detection of already encountered attacks. These memory cells, being highly random in nature, are dependent on the evolution of the detectors and guarantee greater immunity from anomalies and attacks. The fact that the whole procedure is enveloped in the concepts of approximate binding and memory cells of lightweight of natural immune systems makes this system reliable, robust and quick responding.","","978-0-7695-3184-7;9780769531847","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557836","artificial immune system;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system","Artificial immune systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Detectors;Gene expression;Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Phase detection","genetic algorithms;security of data","anomaly detection;artificial immune system;computer networks;evolution induced secondary immunity;genetic algorithm;genetic operators;intrusion detection system;memory cells;natural immune systems;primary immune response;secondary immune response","","5","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes may lose power, crash, or simply move out of range of other nodes in the network. Identifying the root cause is complicated by a lack of fixed monitoring and analysis infrastructure. Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster. This effect is more pronounced in sparse networks.","2165-9605;21659605","978-1-4577-1588-4;9781457715884","978-3-901882-44-9;9783901882449","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104019","MANET;cross-layer;data dissemination;failure detection;network efficiency","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Detectors;Heart beat;Mobile computing;Protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","MANET;cross-layer cluster-based data dissemination;failure detection;k-hop cluster;neighbour-hood observation;node disconnection;node failure;routing message;spanning tree;sparse network","","0","","16","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.
