In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","14","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advent of big data era, it is expected the data analytic techniques to be much faster and more efficient than ever before. Moreover, one of the challenges with many modern algorithms is that they run too slowly in software to have any practical value. This paper proposes a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based intrusion detection system (IDS), driven by a new coupled metric learning to discover the inter- and intra-coupling relationships against the growth of data volumes and item relationship to provide a new approach for efficient anomaly detections. This work is experimented on our previously published NetFlow-based IDS dataset, which is further processed into the categorical data for coupled metric learning purpose. The overall performance of the new hardware system has been further compared with the presence of conventional Bayesian classifier and Support Vector Machines classifier. The experimental results show the very promising performance by considering the coupled metric learning scheme in the FPGA implementation. The false alarm rate is successfully reduced down to 5% while the high detection rate (=99.9%) is maintained.","2375-9232;23759232","978-1-4799-4275-6;9781479942756","","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022747","Metric Learning; Field Programmable Gate Arrays; Netflow; Intrusion Detection Systems","Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Neural networks;Real-time systems;Software;Vectors","Internet;data analysis;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;support vector machines","Bayesian classifier;FPGA-based intrusion detection system;Internet end-users;NetFlow-based IDS dataset;data analytic techniques;device to device connections;false alarm rate;high-frequency field programmable gate arrays;metric learning;real-time anomalies detection;real-time online fraud detection system security;support vector machines classifier","","1","","29","","","14-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A system and a multi-core architecture to defend from these algorithmic complexity attacks is presented in the second part of the paper. The integration of this system with two different DPI engines is demonstrated and discussed. The vulnerability is exposed by showing how a simple low bandwidth cache-miss attack takes down the Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern matching algorithm that lies at the heart of most DPI engines. As a first step in the mitigation of the attack, we have developed a compressed variant of the AC algorithm that improves the worst case performance (under an attack). Still, under normal traffic its running-time is worse than classical AC implementations. To overcome this problem, we introduce <formula formulatype=inline> <img src=/images/tex/35781.gif alt={\rm MCA}^{2}> </formula>Multi-Core Architecture to Mitigate Complexity Attacks, which dynamically combines the classical AC algorithm with our compressed implementation, to provide a robust solution to mitigate this cache-miss attack.

In this paper, we defined the chi-square method, and then analyze the all amount of incoming packets to our College focusing on the source IP address using chi-square method. As the results, we were able to extract the following features. Firstly, the number of packets was the more suitable scale of the window in the chi-square method than the time scale.

These insider threats make use of internal network flaws as the loop holes and are the root cause for data exfiltration and infiltration (Data leakage). Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern. The performance of the proposed Hybrid IDS is examined using test bed with normal and various attack scenarios.","","978-1-4673-6822-3;9781467368223","","10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219827","CEP;Hybrid IDS;IDS;Insider Threat;MCA;Multivariate Correlation Analysis","Covariance matrices;Feature extraction;Linux;Random access memory;Servers;Standards;Testing","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","CEP engine;CEP module;complex event processing;data exfiltration;data infiltration;data leakage problem;file system privilege sharing;file system sharing;host IDS;hybrid IDS;hybrid intrusion detection system;internal information system;internal network flaw;loop hole;multivariate correlation analysis;network IDS;network breach problem;root access sharing;stateful packet inspection;threat analysis;threat monitoring;threat prediction","","0","","8","","","26-28 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reliable detection of network intrusions is an important problem, misclassification of an intrusion is an issue in and of itself reducing overall accuracy of detection. A variety of potential methods exist to develop an improved system to perform classification more accurately. Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly. In particular, classification using the ensemble algorithm, StackingC, with F-Measure performance and derived Information Gain Ratio, as well as their subsequent correlation as a combined measure, is presented.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F-Measure performance;StackingC;data retrieval;ensemble algorithm;ensemble learning;feature pairings;feature selection;information gain ratio;information retrieval;misclassification;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;reliable detection","","","","20","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present the architecture of a system for the detection and management of emergencies in smart buildings. The designed architecture shows some novelties and key features which distinguish it from already existing solutions. Indeed, the proposed architecture exploits the existing building management systems leveraging mobile crowd sensing to collect valuable information during a crisis.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To enhance performance, rules are typically compiled into a matching automaton that can quickly identify the subset of rules that are applicable to a given network packet. While deterministic automata provide the best performance, previous research has shown that such automata can be exponential in the size and/or number of rules. Nondeterministic automata can avoid size explosion, but their matching time can increase quickly with the number of rules. In contrast, we present a new technique that constructs polynomial size automata. Moreover, we show that the matching time of our automata is insensitive to the number of rules. The key idea in our approach is that of decomposing and reordering the tests on packet header fields so that the result of performing a test can be utilized on behalf of many rules. Our experiments demonstrate major reductions in space requirements over previous techniques, as well as significant improvements in matching speed. Our technique can uniformly handle prioritized and unprioritized rules, and support applications that require single-match as well as multi-match.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2489182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295611","Firewalls;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Monitoring;Packet Classification;Packet classification;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network monitoring","Automata;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Polynomials;Runtime","authorisation;deterministic automata;firewalls","access-control system;compact packet matching automata;condition factorization;deterministic automata;intrusion detection;nondeterministic automata;rule-based matching","","","","45","","2015-10-09","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, denial of service (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach cross layer based intrusion detection system(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance. The simulations conducted in ns2 and proved that our work achieved high performance with fewer overheads.","","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447185","AODV;Ad hoc Networks;Cross-layer Design;Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks;IEEE 802.11;Intrusion Detection;MAC layer;Misuse or Signature Detection;Network Monitor;Routing layer;Security","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Protocols;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;MAC layer;cross layer based intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;malicious attack;network monitor;protocol stack layer;routing layer;signature detection;trace file pattern;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","16","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional MAS-based distributed IDSs commonly do their detection work within a framework that employs the method of distributed data collection and hierarchical data analysis.

Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites.

In this article we describe a CRN based on IEEE wireless regional area network (WRAN) and describe some of the security threats against it. For the secondary users in the CRN to quickly detect whether they are being attacked, a simple yet effective IDS is then presented. Our proposal uses non-parametric cumulative sum (cusum) as the change point detection algorithm to discover the abnormal behavior due to attacks. Our proposed IDS adopts an anomaly detection approach and it profiles the CRN system parameters through a learning phase. So, our proposal is also able to detect new types of attacks. As an example, we present the case of detection of a jamming attack, which was not known to the IDS beforehand.

Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA).

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates.

It enables entities to cope with uncertainty and uncontrollability caused by the free will of others. Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works on trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of network dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770276","Aggregation;MANET;Propagation;Security;Trust Computations","Ad hoc networks;Measurement;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Sensors","computational complexity;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;computational complexity constraint;mobile ad hoc networks;network dynamics;security services;trust computations;trust computing;trust dynamics","","51","","144","","2011-05-19","Second Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"A rapid deployment guided radar sensor","K. Harman; B. Hodgins; J. Patchell; M.

Existing solutions such as portable microwave or passive infra-red (PIR) sensors are relatively inexpensive, but cannot work over uneven terrain, around corners, or in foliage. The cost and installation complexity of these sensors increases rapidly as more units are required. The Repels<sup>reg</sup> RF sensor provides many of the required features, but uses sensor cables that are overtly mounted above ground. The OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology was first introduced at the 2004 Carnahan Conference, applying ultra wide band radar principles to a ranging leaky cable guided radar sensor. In 2007, a program called TFDIDS (terrain following deployable intrusion detection sensor) was initiated in conjunction with the US Air Force, to apply the advancements in this ranging technology to the rapid deployment sensor needs defined by the USAF tactical automated sensor system (TASS). This advancement includes a novel invention employing the processing of dual parallel leaky sensor cables, termed Stereo OmniTrax. This processing dramatically improves the discrimination between human intrusion threats and small nuisance targets or environmental effects. The TFDIDS system provides a complete lightweight sensor kit for the rapid deployment (less than 30 minutes) of a 100 m detection zone, and later, for the sensor's retrieval and reuse. TFDIDS interfaces to standard Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) including USAF powering and communications devices. This paper outlines the key elements of the TFDIDS design, describes its components, and explains how TFDIDS provides reliable detection using a surface sensor cable deployment. Initial performance results are presented, from tests conducted at the Senstar SITE in 2008. The test applications include through-the-woods, on tarmac and o- n typical open field surfaces.","1071-6572;10716572","978-1-4244-4169-3;9781424441693","978-1-4244-4170-9;9781424441709","10.1109/CCST.2009.5335532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335532","Rapid deployment perimeter security sensor;border security;leaky cable sensor;rapid deployment;sensor field testing;terrainfollowing deployable intrusion detection system;ultra wideband radar","Cables;Costs;Infrared sensors;Microwave sensors;Radio frequency;Security;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Testing;Ultra wideband radar","infrared detectors;military radar;ultra wideband radar","OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology;RF sensor;Stereo OmniTrax;TFDIDS design;US Air Force;USAF tactical automated sensor system;deployable intrusion detection sensor;dual parallel leaky sensor cables;radar sensor;security sensor;standard Government furnished equipment;ultrawide band radar principles","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. (Rather than STIDE or Stide or s-tide, we have chosen stide in keeping with the way the detector was referred to in the paper by Warrender et al., 1999.) Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, why six? accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the why six issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.806130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159659","","Blindness;Change detection algorithms;Computer security;Detectors;Embedded computing;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Solids","computer viruses","anomaly-based intrusion detector;data sequences;detection blindness;detection capability;information security;intrusion detection;masqueraders;novel attacks;operational limits;root privileges;sequence lengths;stide","","24","","13","","","Jan 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Data mining techniques are efficient to construct a reliable Intrusion Detection System. Classification is an essential task in data mining. In this paper, a new classification method is proposed to build an accurate and efficient classifier for intrusion detection. The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently. On the basis of the extracted rules, the multi-feature space is projected into a two-dimensional average matching degree space.

The system is trained using a 66% of randomly selected connections in as a subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection data set. The training model is created by a trained classifier and then used to classify the remaining 34% subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset in order to report on the effectiveness of the model. The results show that based on a selected set of features extracted using subset evaluation algorithm for classifiers and a best-first search mechanism, that decision tree algorithm J48 based on C4.5 provides 99.95% of correctly classified instances and is better than the Naive Bayes technique.

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lastly will provide some results which will be fruitful for user in accordance to the performance.","","978-1-4799-2353-3;9781479923533","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921740","Dataset;IDS;intrusion detection;performance;policy;security","Computers;Engines;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Probes","security of data","DARPA 1999 dataset;empirical approach;information sharing;intrusion detection system;networking field;security measures","","0","","19","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these type of networks all communication occurs through a wireless medium and the nature of the network is decentralized and dynamic. Hence it probes for a number of security problems and in order provide security against malicious attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is commonly used as a second route of protection in MANET. Intrusion detection models are used to detect the attacks based on the patterns and alerts in case of intruders are being met with the system. In this paper, we propose and implement intrusion-detection system grounded on artificial neural network model such as Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based competitive network, which in turn plays a vital role in detection of malicious nodes based on input data patterns. The proposed model deals with different types of attacks and their detection approach based on SOM model. The approach aids at increasing Detection rate as well as reducing the False alarm rate, which in turn helps to detect those attacks before it makes larger damage to the network and prevent them with supportive techniques and increase the network performance. The experimental results of proposed model is evaluated under different parameters.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996118","Detection rate;False alarm rate;Intrusion detection;MANET;SOM;artificial neural network;security","Data models;Interrupters;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Neurons","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;SOM based competitive network;artificial neural network model;false alarm rate reduction;input data patterns;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile ad-hoc networks;security problems;self organizing map;wireless medium","","0","","28","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key pre-distribution scheme is proposed such that nodes in the route share keys while those that are not in the route do not share keys with nodes that are in the route. Simulations have been done for both small and large areas, low and high density, on-route and non-route connectivity scenarios.

The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity. Moreover, the detection algorithm can be implemented in software without modifying the existing infrastructure.

Much research has been conducted in the multi-stage detection area, in order to build a framework based on an events correlation approach. This paper proposes a framework that predicts multi-stage attacks based on a different approach, which is an IP information evaluation. This approach was chosen after analysing three different multi-stage attack scenarios.

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall network behavior of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","1095-2055;10952055","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","18","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-9919-9;9781424499199","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0;9781479927630","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on","20020806","1999","","","120","132","There is often the need to update an installed intrusion detection system (IDS) due to new attack methods or upgraded computing environments. Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection.

A large number of devices connected over the Internet leads to an increase in vulnerabilities and security threats, which makes the identification of critical assets necessary. Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly. However, the Random Forest algorithm is computationally intensive and may not work for large datasets. Naive Bayes algorithm yielded the worst performance and KNearest Neighbor's performance was very close to that achieved by Support Vector Machines. Our results shows that for the given dataset, Support Vector Machine based classifier was found to be a good compromise in terms of accuracy and computational expensiveness.","","978-1-5090-2460-5;9781509024605","","10.1109/WAINA.2016.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7471285","asset classification;device classification;security;telecommunications","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Servers;Support vector machines;Training","Bayes methods;Big Data;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes;security of data;support vector machines","F-score;Internet of Things;IoT;K-nearest neighbor;asset identification;big data analytics;machine learning algorithm;naive Bayes;network enabled device;random forest classifier;security breaches;support vector machine","","","","44","","","23-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for such matching arises from two independent trends. First, the volume and share of compressed HTTP traffic is constantly increasing. Second, due to their superior expressibility, current Deep Packet Inspection engines use regular expressions more and more frequently. We present an algorithmic framework to accelerate such matching, taking advantage of information gathered when the traffic was initially compressed. HTTP compression is typically performed through the GZIP protocol, which uses back-references to repeated strings. Our algorithm is based on calculating (for every byte) the minimum number of (previous) bytes that can be part of a future regular expression matching. When inspecting a back-reference, only these bytes should be taken into account, thus enabling one to skip repeated strings almost entirely without missing a match. We show that our generic framework works with either NFA-based or DFA-based implementations and gains performance boosts of more than 70%. Moreover, it can be readily adapted to most existing regular expression matching algorithms, which usually are based either on NFA, DFA or combinations of the two. Finally, we discuss other applications in which calculating the number of relevant bytes becomes handy, even when the traffic is not compressed.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218421","","Acceleration;Automata;Computers;Conferences;Estimation;Inspection;Pattern matching","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;hypermedia;pattern matching;transport protocols","DFA-based implementation;GZIP protocol;NFA-based implementation;compressed HTTP traffic;deterministic finite automata;hypertext transfer protocol;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The context specification information is used as input parameters to the decision support mechanism that controls the operations in an autonomous system. Our specification of the context allows it to change dynamically, as the system operations progress.

Furthermore, we introduced an intrusion detection framework, and tested the validity and feasibility of false positive elimination in intrusion detection. The process steps of false positive elimination were clearly described, and additionally, two typical clustering algorithms, the K-means algorithm and the FCM algorithm, were implemented for false alerts identification and filtration. Also, we defined three evaluation indexes: the elimination rate, the false elimination rate and the miss elimination rate. Accordingly, we used DARPA 2000 LLDOS1.0 dataset for our experiments, and adopted Snort as our intrusion detection system.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current. The results shown later indicate that classification accuracy improved from 75.98% to 81.44% after using AGAAR attribute reduction for the NSL-KDD dataset.

Despite the benefits of such functionality, there are still several security issues which have not yet been thoroughly assessed and quantified. We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities. We find that the performance for both detectors degrades as shown by their Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves when intra-cloud live migration is initiated while VMs are under a netscan (NS) or a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2014.6968968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968968","Cloud computing;anomaly detection;live VM migration","Computer crime;Conferences;Detectors;Entropy;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Vectors","cloud computing;computer network security;virtual machines","K-means;PCA;ROC curves;anomaly detection;denial-of-service attack;intracloud live migration;live intracloud virtual-machine migration;netscan;receiver operating characteristic curves;resource management;security issues;virtualized cloud environments","","2","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers.

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","0190-3918;01903918","978-1-4244-7918-4;9781424479184","978-0-7695-4157-0;9780769541570","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For detection of the DOS attacks, this improved model can consider the relativity of the data set of DOS attacks. Finally, the experiments on the DOS data set confirm their validities and feasibilities over this improved GSOM model.","2326-8123;23268123","978-1-4244-1673-8;9781424416738","978-1-4244-1674-5;9781424416745","10.1109/ICCIS.2008.4670765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4670765","Deny of Service (DOS);Gray Correlation Coefficient;Grey Theory;SOM","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer science;Engineering management;Integral equations;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Technology management","grey systems;security of data;self-organising feature maps","denial of service;deny-of-service attack detection;grey self-organizing map model","","0","","12","","","21-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the complexity and the number of different variables involved with information security, a special analytical tool is required to address the problem of how to balance the investment in different parts of the system in order to reduce the losses due to cyber attacks. Using the System Dynamics approach as an effective analytical tool is proposed to demonstrate dealing of complex situations due to cyber attacks involving different variables such as attractiveness of targets to losses, and their inter-relationships. Using this model, a casual loop diagram can be used to present an overview of the model and its associated variables. The model is based on quantitative measurements of security and the time that attackers may need to compromise a system. The model will assist in achieving the balance between investment on security and the resultant reduction of losses due to cyber attacks.","","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207084","cyber security;economic impact;security investment;system dynamics","Analytical models;Computer security;Investment;Loss measurement;Organizations","economics;information systems;security of data","Internet;casual loop diagram;cyber attacks;cyber security;economic impact assessment;information security;information systems;quantitative measurements;system dynamics approach","","0","","25","","","24-27 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The application of Hybrid Neural Network Algorithms in Intrusion Detection System","L. Xiangmei; Q.

Firstly, the algorithms use the advantage of the improved GA with strong whole searching capacity to search global optimal point in the whole question domain. Then, it adopts the strongpoint of the LM algorithm with fast local searching to fine search near the global optimal point. The paper used respectively the three algorithms, namely the Improved GA, LM algorithm and HNNA, to adjust the input and output parameters of the ANN model, and adopt the theories of the fusion of the multi-classifiers to structure the Intrusion Detection System. By repeatedly experiment, it is found that the HNNA is better in stability and convergence precision than LM algorithm and improved GA from the training result. The testing results are also proved that the detection rate of the multiple classifiers intrusion detection system based on HNNA learning algorithm, including all attack categories that has a few or many training samples, is higher than the IDS that use LM and improved GA learning algorithm, and the false negative rate is less. So, the HNNA is proved to be feasible in theory and practice.","","978-1-4244-8691-5;9781424486915","","10.1109/ICEBEG.2011.5882041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5882041","Intrusion detection;genual algorithm Levenberg-Marquard algorithm;neural network","Artificial neural networks;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Testing;Training","","","","0","","9","","","6-8 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
