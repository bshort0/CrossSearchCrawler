Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in the face of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection. We also discuss our implementation of the UMIP model for Linux using the Linux Security Modules framework, and show that it is simple to configure, has low overhead, and effectively defends against a number of network-based attacks.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2848-1;0769528481","","10.1109/SP.2007.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223222","","Access control;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Permission;Power system security;Protection;Usability","Linux;authorisation;systems analysis","Linux security module framework;mandatory usable access control system;network-based attack;operating system;usable mandatory integrity protection","","10","","24","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), efficiently identifying the botnet in time can be a challenge. Recently, the unsupervised learning methods such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection. However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks. The experimental results from real-world traffic data show that forensic analysis using GHSOM can efficiently identify several DDoS attack patterns and generate filtering rules for intrusion detection system (IDS) by further inspecting and book marking the suspicious IP sources.","2375-9232;23759232","978-1-4799-3143-9;9781479931439","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753967","Data clustering;Feature extraction;Network anomaly detection;Network forensics;Neural networks","Data visualization;Filtering;Forensics;IP networks;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","IP networks;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation;digital forensics;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","Botnet;GHSOM visualization specialty;IDS;IP sources;K-means;attack pattern detection;book marking;distributed denial of service attack;filtering rule generation;geometric distances;growing hierarchical SOM;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;hierarchical architecture;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;network forensic analysis;network traffic data;real-world traffic data;sequential time stamps;several DDoS attack patterns;static IP flow data analysis;topological space;unsupervised learning methods;victim network traces","","0","","14","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.","1091-0050;10910050","978-1-4799-0052-7;9781479900527","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421","","Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security","","1","","20","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678;15450678","978-1-4673-1423-7;9781467314237","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9;9781479941919","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a stochastic zero-sum game model to study the strategies. Primary users, secondary users and jammers are the three types of agents in the system. The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming. In the numerical experiments, we point out that the payoff of the secondary users increases with the number of available jamming-free channels and is eventually limited by the behavior of primary users.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502451","","Cognitive radio;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Emulation;Frequency;Jamming;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","Markov processes;cognitive radio;jamming;stochastic games;wireless channels","Markovian game model;antijamming scenario;jamming-free channels;multichannel cognitive radio systems;stochastic zero-sum game model;zero-sum interactions","","14","","20","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6;0780397886","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4;9781467300254","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a unsafe zone to isolate user's SQL queries from a safe zone of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8;9781424410248","978-1-4244-1025-5;9781424410255","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","game theory;metering;power system measurement;power system protection;power system state estimation;smart power grids","AMI energy-theft detection Issue;advanced metering infrastructure security;classification-based AMI energy-theft detection;first ubiquitous platform;fixed computing platform;game theory-based energy-theft detection;security vulnerabilities;smart grid proliferation;state estimation-based energy-theft detection;utility companies","","9","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and physical domains. From a physical perspective, SOCCA scores power system contingencies based on cyber network configuration, whereas from a cyber perspective, control network vulnerabilities are ranked according to the underlying power system topology.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2280399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687271","Contingency analysis;cyber-physical systems;security;situational awareness;state estimation","Algorithm design and analysis;Indexes;Mathematical model;Network topology;Power grids;Security","power grids;power system planning;power system security","SOCCA;accidental contingency;control network;cyber components;cyber network configuration;cyber perspective;cyber-physical security evaluation;grid operation;malicious compromises;physical components;power infrastructures;power system contingency;power system topology;security-oriented cyber-physical contingency analysis","","7","","44","","2013-12-18","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS.

The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445;17389445","978-1-4673-0150-3;9781467301503","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies. Finally, we construct required logical protocols in the hierarchical framework; hierarchical intrusion detection and prevention protocols.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2010.2051556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560697","Clustering;industrial applications;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;wireless industrial sensor network","Communication system security;Industry applications;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","hierarchical intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;wireless industrial sensor network","","31","","45","","2010-09-02","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20080715","2008","","","173","178","The existing intrusion detection systems are of varied type and hence show distinct preferences in detecting certain types of attacks with improved accuracy, while performing moderately on the other types. With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple Intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement in comparison to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-2414-6;9781424424146","978-1-4244-2415-3;9781424424153","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565049","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","Data analysis;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Service oriented architecture;Social network services","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","advanced sensor fusion technique;data-dependent decision fusion;enhanced intrusion detection;neural network supervised learner unit","","3","","28","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks. Our method uses Random Forests to build classifiers based on which the incoming slow-read traffic can be detected at the destination.

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security.

According to the trust model in social networks, this paper proposes an efficient scheme which is resilient to both fault and intrusion based on trust relationship for IP networks. This scheme not only borrows the trust rating from the social links, but also qualitatively describes the relationships between the trust rating and the network behavior.

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality.

One of the popular social engineering attacks is a phishing attack, exploiting humans' vulnerability in order to obtain individuals' private or credential information. Recent studies have found that the so called `phishing susceptibility' (i.e., the likelihood of being phished) is closely correlated with the individuals' personality traits. In particular, the relations between phishing susceptibility and Big Five personality traits have been analyzed via empirical studies in diverse domains. However, little prior work has proposed a mathematical model investigating the effect of an individual's personality traits on perceived trust or risk and decision performance. This work proposes a probability model using Stochastic Petri Nets in order to examine the effect of an individual human's personality traits on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance. Our results show that agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effect on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance particularly when openness and conscientiousness is very low. The developed mathematical model can be applied to predict what personality profiles in an organization are more exposed to social engineering, suggesting customized security training scenarios.","","","","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497779","perceived risk;perceived trust;personality traits;phishing susceptibility","Analytical models;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Petri nets;Resilience;Security;Uncertainty","Petri nets;computer crime;trusted computing","Big Five personality traits;customized security training scenarios;cyberspace;decision performance;human personality traits;mathematical model;modeling;neuroticism;perceived trust;phishing attack;phishing susceptibility;phishing vulnerability;probability model;social engineering attacks;stochastic Petri nets","","","","21","","","21-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2;9789639799592","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","1","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system.

Unlike existing work, we consider a trust metric considering both quality of service (QoS) trust and social trust for detecting malicious nodes. By statistically analyzing peer-to-peer trust evaluation results collected from sensor nodes, each cluster head applies trust-based intrusion detection to assess the trustworthiness and maliciousness of sensor nodes in its cluster. Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability.

In this paper, a scheme using association algorithm and clustering algorithm is proposed for routing anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks. The scheme uses the Apriori algorithm to extract traffic patterns from both routing table and network traffic packets and subsequently the K-means cluster algorithm adaptively generates a detection model. Through the combination of these two algorithms, routing attacks can be detected effectively and automatically. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is able to detect new attacks that have not previously been seen Moreover, the proposed detection scheme is based on no priori knowledge and then can be applied to a wide range of different sensor networks for a variety of routing attacks.","","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","978-1-4244-1009-5;9781424410095","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469386","anomaly detection;data-mining;routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;feature extraction;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Apriori algorithm;anomaly detection;association algorithm;clustering algorithm;data-mining;traffic pattern extraction;wireless routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy. It is also effective to identify most known attacks as well as new attacks.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate.

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the classical prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199270","","Communications Society;Compression algorithms;Cryptography;Data security;Entropy;Huffman coding;Image coding;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;Markov processes;encoding;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Huffman coding;Internet;Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm;TCP;compression algorithms;dynamic Markov coding;intrusion detection systems;network anomaly detection;network security;network traffic;security attacks","","1","","19","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional intrusion detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely attack signature, resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2;9780769535012","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This automation allows ML-IDS to detect network attacks and proactively protect against them. ML-IDS inspects and analyzes network traffic using three levels of granularities (traffic flow, packet header, and payload), and employs an efficient fusion decision algorithm to improve the overall detection rate and minimize the occurrence of false alarms.

Masquerading is an important factor for identity theft and current authentication systems using traditional methods woefully lack mechanisms to detect and prevent it. This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0;9781424450190","978-1-4244-5020-6;9781424450206","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","4","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Anomaly detection approaches hold out more promise, as they can detect new types of intrusions because these new intrusions, by assumption, will deviate from ldquonormalrdquo behavior. But these methods generally suffer from several major drawbacks: computing the anomaly model itself is a time-consuming and processor-heavy task. To avoid these limits, we propose a mobile agent based model for intrusion detection system, called MAFIDS, including new metrics issued from emergent indicators of the agent synergy and a proposed event correlation engine. We detail the implementation of our model showing its capabilities to detect the SYN Flooding attack in a short time and lower false alarm rate by comparing it to SNORT.","","978-1-4244-5087-9;9781424450879","978-0-7695-3838-9;9780769538389","10.1109/NSS.2009.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319064","Anomaly;Network Intrusion Detection System;agent architecture;metrics","Capacitive sensors;Computer networks;Computer security;Engines;Floods;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Sensor systems","mobile agents;security of data;software metrics","MAFIDS;SYN Flooding attack;agent synergy;anomaly detection approach;distinct software process;distributed agent architecture;emergent indicator metrics;event correlation engine;malicious activity identification;mobile agent-based model-for-intrusion detection system","","1","","35","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Identifying intrusions in computer networks with principal component analysis","W. Wang; R. Battiti","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Telecommun., Trento Univ., Italy","First International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES'06)","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","8","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
