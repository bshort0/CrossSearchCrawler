An effective Intrusion Detection System requires high accuracy and detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4673-4942-0;9781467349420","978-1-4673-4940-6;9781467349406","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems are an effective way to detect malicious connections in a computer network. To get there, they classifies the connections as normal or abnormal, using different algorithms. In this paper three methods are used, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the two-stage algorithm PCA+LDA as related works, and the Direct Linear Discriminant analysis (D-LDA) algorithm as a proposed method. The PCA step in the PCA+LDA algorithm eliminates the problem of singularity but the PCA criterion is not compatible with the LDA criterion and thus may discard the important discriminative information, unlike the D-LDA algorithm which keeps them and gets rid of the singularity problem. In this work, we propose its implementation for intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in terms of detection accuracy rate which is 97.75%.","","","","10.1109/ICoCS.2015.7483227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483227","Intrusion detection system;KDDCup99;direct linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Euclidean distance;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis","computer network security;principal component analysis","D-LDA algorithm;IT security;bank data;computer network;cyber attacks;direct LDA;direct linear discriminant analysis algorithm;governmental data;malicious connection detection;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;singularity problem;two-stage algorithm PCA-LDA","","","","9","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, access-control mechanisms operate independently on each service, which often leads to inconsistent or incorrect application of the intended system-wide policy. To begin to solve these problems, we propose a new system for defense-in-depth using global security policies. Under a global security policy, every policy decision is made with near-global knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge changes, given an initial configuration provided by the administrator. Using a variety of actuators, we make the full array of defensive capabilities available to the global policy.

DSC can detect zero-day scanning worms with a high detection rate and very low false positive rate. (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of early worm warning based on local victim information. For example, warning occurs with 0.19% infection of all vulnerable hosts on Internet when using a /12 monitored network.

This paper describes a novel concept for automatic signature generation based on efficient autonomous attack classification. Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1;9781424457861","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.

At the state-of-the-art, IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of normal, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. This paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training. We show that using small detectors in a hierarchy gives a better result than a single large detector. Some techniques can be used not only to detect anomalies, but to distinguish among them","","0-7803-6521-6;0780365216","","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904111","","Detectors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Monitoring;Network servers;Neural networks;Physics;Protection;Protocols;Statistics","backpropagation;neural nets;safety systems;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ANN;IDS;TCP;anomaly detector;attack signatures recognition;backpropagation neural networks;false alarms;intrusion detection;network behavior monitoring;operating system;protocols","","1","","6","","","2000","22 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme. A supercapacitor is utilized for buffering, energy storing, and filtering purposes, which enables more functions of the IOT smart nodes such as active sensing and system-on-chip (SOC) signal processing. The output voltage ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 V for different device loads, such as sensors, SOC, or wireless transceivers.

Therefore, a range of recent studies have focused on evaluating different machine learning classifiers with the aim of identifying the most appropriate classifier to be used for particular decision making problem-domain. The majority of these studies have used a single dataset within a certain medical-related classification domain. Nevertheless, evaluating machine-learning classifiers with one sample of data appears to be unsatisfying, perhaps it is not reflecting the classifiers capabilities or their behavioral patterns under different circumstances. In this study, five well-known supervised machine-learning classifiers were examined using five different real-world datasets with a range of attributes. The main aim was to illustrate not only the impact of the datasets volume and attributes on the evaluation, but also and more importantly, present the classifiers capabilities and shortcomings under certain conditions, which potentially provide a guidance or instructions to help health analysts and researchers to determine the most suitable classifier to address a particular medical-related decision making problem.","2157-8672;21578672","978-1-4673-8352-3;9781467383523","","10.1109/IWSSIP.2015.7314218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314218","classification accuracy;clinical decision support system;evaluation;machine learning;sensitivity;time complexity","Accuracy;Diseases;Liver;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","decision support systems;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CDSS;behavioral pattern;behavioural pattern;clinical decision support system;decision making problem-domain;health analyst;health care system;machine learning classifier;machine-learning technique;medical application;medical-related classification domain;medical-related decision making;real-world dataset;supervised machine-learning classifier","","","","21","","","10-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT).

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","33","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each day the news media report yet another security breach-sometimes a localized single crime or prank at others, a denial-of-service attack affecting millions of people. As electronic commerce becomes increasingly pervasive, the subject can only become more critical. One of the more interesting techniques for enhancing information system security is detecting that an intrusion has taken place. Although intrusion-detection systems have been a part of the information security landscape for over 25 years, their proper role in the overall security picture is often misunderstood. They are not preventative security measures. Most often, they are used as active security mechanisms in conjunction with other (passive) information assurance processes like firewalls, smart cards, and virtual private networks. In practice, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) attempts to detect attacks or attack preparations by monitoring either the traffic on a computer network or the application or operating system activities within a computer. Once such behavior is detected, the IDS may alert a security administrator or it may invoke an automated response (such as closing down external communication paths or initiating a mechanism to trace the source of an attack). If an IDS detects attack behavior soon enough, it might be able to invoke a response to thwart the attack.","0018-9235;00189235","","","10.1109/6.887597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887597","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Electronic commerce;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Smart cards;Virtual private networks","information systems;security of data","active security mechanisms;computer network traffic monitoring;denial-of-service attack;electronic commerce;information systems security;intrusion-detection systems;localized single crime;security breach","","13","4","","","","Dec 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The process of discovering interesting patterns in such large data sets is referred to as data mining. Outlier detection is a data mining task consisting in the discovery of observations which deviate substantially from the rest of the data, and has many important practical applications. Outlier detection in very large data sets is however computationally very demanding and currently requires highperformance computing facilities. We propose a family of parallel algorithms for Graphic Processing Units (GPU), derived from two distance-based outlier detection algorithms: the BruteForce and the SolvingSet. We analyze their performance with an extensive set of experiments, comparing the GPU implementations with the base CPU versions and obtaining significant speedups.","","978-1-4799-0836-3;9781479908363","","10.1109/HPCSim.2013.6641405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641405","Data mining exploiting GPUs;outlier detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Indexes;Instruction sets;Upper bound","data mining;graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;very large databases","BruteForce algorithm;GPU implementations;SolvingSet algorithm;data mining;distance-based outlier detection algorithm;fast outlier detection;graphic processing units;high performance computing facilities;interesting pattern discovery;parallel algorithms;performance analysis;very large data sets","","2","","22","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we lack detailed information just when we need it the most. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2210217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6248214","Computer security;checkpointing;information security;intrusion detection;operating systems;system recovery;virtual machine monitors","Couplings;Forensics;Monitoring;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","computer forensics;data privacy","computer systems;data access;data exfiltration attempts;data provenance;forensic analysis;forensic layer records;forensic platform;hypervisor;multiple disks;privacy breaches;tracking mechanism;version-based audit log;virtualized environment","","0","","37","","2012-07-24","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size.

But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naive bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.

Due to the multi-hop nature of mesh networks, it is possible for an adversary to reroute the network traffic via many denial of service (DoS) attacks, and hence affect the correct functionality of the mesh routing protocol. In this paper, based on a comparative study, we choose the most suitable secure mesh routing protocol for IoT-based AAL applications. Then, we analyze the resilience of this protocol against DoS attacks. Focusing on the hello flooding attack, the protocol is simulated and analyzed in terms of data packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput.

In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time.

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The distributed nature of the network makes centralized intrusion detection difficult, while resource constraints of the nodes and the characteristics of the wireless medium often render decentralized, node-based approaches impractical. We demonstrate that an active-probing-based network intrusion detection system (AP-NIDS) is practical for WMNs. The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol. For the example of a selective packet dropping attack, we develop the detection states for our Bayes model, and show its feasibility.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) that automatically generate and apply protection to client systems have been proposed as a solution. Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4;9781467327084","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-1940-7;0769519407","","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327","","Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic","","26","30","20","","","11-14 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, the nature of MANET causes security risks because mobile nodes are deployed in the open field and wireless communication makes the information accessible by anyone. Conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a tactical MANET becomes challenging because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address these issue, we first study the host-based detection architecture to monitor and detect cyber attacks and then develop sampling techniques to balance the tradeoff between detection accuracy and bandwidth overhead. We also investigate the impact of host-based attack detection on MANET.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4673-1729-0;9781467317290","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415605","","Accuracy;Arrays;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;risk analysis;telecommunication security","MANET;computing environment;cyber attack monitoring;cyber attacks;effective sampling techniques;host-based attack detection;host-based detection architecture;host-based intrusion detection;infrastructureless network environment;network-centric operation;resilient protected communication;security risks;tactical mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication","","0","","14","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem","","0-7803-5965-8;0780359658","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181","","Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring","electric fields;safety systems","electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions","","1","","4","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a new anomaly detection algorithm based on hierarchical clustering, called ADBHC, is proposed. ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions.

Intrusion detection parameters are numerous and in many cases they present uncertain and imprecise causal relationships which can affect attack types. A Bayesian Network (BN) is known as graphical modeling tool used to model decision problems containing uncertainty. In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. The goal is to recognize signatures of known attacks, match the observed behavior with those known signatures, and signal intrusion when there is a match. A major difficulty of this system is that intrusions signatures change over the time and the system must be retrained. An IDS must be able to adapt to these changes.
