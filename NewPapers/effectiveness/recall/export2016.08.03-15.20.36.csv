So, to further explore the efficacy of MC, this paper presents a new attempt in the application of SN P system and as well provides a novel idea and method for attack detection. The extension of SN P system called trapezoidal Fuzzy Reasoning Spiking Neural P (tFRSN P) system is adopted in the network intrusion prediction model. SN P system is a neural-like computing model inspired from the way spiking neurons communicate using spikes. It has a graphical modeling advantage which makes it well suited for fuzzy reasoning as well as fuzzy knowledge representation. In order to evaluate the performance of tFRSN P system in intrusion detection, the publicly available KDD Cup benchmark dataset was employed. After the experiments, our results yielded very high detection rate of 99.78% and very low false alarm rate of 0.16% for Brute Force Attack (BFA).","","978-1-4799-8011-6;9781479980116","","10.1109/ACMC.2014.7065804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065804","Cyber-security;Fuzzy reasoning;Intrusion Detection;P System;Rule-based System","Computational modeling;Force;Fuzzy reasoning;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Tin","biocomputing;fuzzy reasoning;knowledge representation;neural nets;security of data","BFA;attack detection;brute force attack;distributed parallel computing model;fuzzy knowledge representation;fuzzy reasoning;graphical modeling advantage;intrusion detection;membrane computing;network security;neural-like computing model;tFRSN P system;trapezoidal fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P system","","0","","21","","","18-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, there is no guarantee that a routed communication path is free of malicious nodes that will not comply with the employed protocol and attempt to interfere the network operations. In this paper, we survey the problem of secure routing in ad hoc wireless networks, and discuss the related techniques of cryptographic key distribution. However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access. The extensions of the solutions to address the problem in more general scenarios are also discussed.","","0-7803-8140-8;0780381408","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290203","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;queueing theory;routing protocols;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;concrete queueing model;cryptographic key distribution;intrusion detection problem;medium access;secure routing protocols;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","26","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposal, the IBW Framework, includes an approach for security in WMN detecting and mitigating the attacks through the use of non-relational databases for the data correlation and the dissemination of intrusion information among the nodes in WMN to reduce the amount of attacks in short time. Data correlation is done from the log data of servers and distributed Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDSs & IPSs) using syslog information with a particular format. Intrusion Prevention Systems can be implemented with any kind of solution, in our case we proposed iptables.

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902777","Network traffic analysis;network traffic identification;protocol reverse engineering;unsupervised information extraction","Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Redundancy","Internet;computer network management;protocols;unsupervised learning","ProWord approach;application protocols;common string;deep packet analysis rules;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram;network management system;network measurement system;network security system;ranking algorithm;traffic payload;unsupervised protocol feature word extraction;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting experts algorithm","","1","","44","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2;9781424499052","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system. Evaluation on Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network corpus shows higher detection accuracy at 87% compare to 56% for Snort signatures. Moreover, false negative reduces to 14% compared to 78% for Snort signatures.","","978-1-4244-8647-2;9781424486472","","10.1109/SCORED.2010.5703974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703974","Signatures generation;behavioural approach;intrusion detection system;rapid malcode","","Internet;alarm systems;behavioural sciences;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;Snort signature;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network;automated malcode signatures generation;automatic signature generation technique;legitimate traffic block;malicious code;selfreplicating malicious program;signature based firewalls network intrusion detection system;signature based malcode detector;signature based tool;sound vulnerability signature;warning system","","0","","24","","","13-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey, we present a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature. We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers.

This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","2155-5486;21555486","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications.

However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.","","978-1-4244-2483-2;9781424424832","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339","","Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic","Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic","","1","3","9","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this scenario, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate and compare automaton models and the data-structures that materialize them. We also adapt state-of-the-art memory layouts to better fit in today's computer architectures. Finally, we apply our methodology to most important automaton models, memory layouts, and well-known signature sets.

This leads to situations where information producers give documents to consumers they should not trust and consumers use information from non-reputable documents or producers. The concepts and technologies developed as part of the Behavior-Based Access Control (BBAC) effort strive to overcome these limitations by means of performing accurate calculations of trustworthiness of actors, e.g., behavior and usage patterns, as well as documents, e.g., provenance and workflow data dependencies. BBAC analyses a wide range of observables for mal-behavior, including network connections, HTTP requests, English text exchanges through emails or chat messages, and edit sequences to documents. The current prototype service strategically combines big data batch processing to train classifiers and real-time stream processing to classifier observed behaviors at multiple layers. To scale up to enterprise regimes, BBAC combines clustering analysis with statistical classification in a way that maintains an adjustable number of classifiers.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357562","HTTP;TCP;big data;chat;documents;email;insider threat;machine learning;support vector machine;trust;usage patterns","Access control;Big data;Computer security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Monitoring","Big Data;authorisation;data analysis;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;trusted computing","BBAC;English text exchanges;HTTP requests;actor trustworthiness;behavior-based access control;big data analytics;big data batch processing;chat messages;classifier training;clustering analysis;document trustworthiness;emails;enterprise environments;information trustworthiness;insider threat detection;interconnected systems;machine learning;mal-behavior;network connections;real-time stream processing;security events;statistical classification","","","","37","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We minimize the communication overhead by clustering the sensor measurements and merging clusters before sending a description of the clusters to the other nodes.

These extracted parameters among all parameters of each normal behavior have a relation with each other which could be computed by regression relations. Each behavior has some pairs of selected parameters including the independent parameter and the dependent one. As an inline detection process, we look at the value of selected parameters of each current session and put them into their computed regression relation. If the computed value of the dependent parameter of each pair has a value greater then what we compute by their regression relation, it will be considered as a deviation. Number of deviations per session and the combination of them is used to label a session as normal or attack.

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy.

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months.

The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/65.283931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=283931","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems","computer networks;network operating systems;open systems;security of data;telecommunication network management","abuse;audit trails;heterogeneous computer networks;host-based IDS;intruder behavior;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;monitored network traffic;network-based IDS;open mode;rulebased misuse models;security;statistical anomaly;unauthorized actions;unauthorized use","","163","81","36","","","May-June 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail.

But it is very difficult to prevent wireless sensor network always from malicious attacks so it is always important to detect them as early as possible so that we can react to the attack not harm to wireless sensor network., This paper proposes Distributed Trust based Intrusion Detection (DTBID) approach which considers several factors for establishing trust of sensor node. Most of the research work only considers the communication behavior to derive the trust. Our intrusion detection system will consider trust which is distributed among some other factors such as energy, reliability, data etc. We derive and formulate trust such as direct trust, recommendation trust, and indirect trust from these factors. We provide an approach to decide whether particular node is malicious node or not by comparing subjective trust derived from our intrusion detection technique to that of objective trust which is calculated based on the actual information of each node without considering any network dynamics such as node mobility, trust decay over time, and any malicious attacks. If there is a lot of difference between subjective trust derived from our model to that of objective trust then we consider sensor node as malicious node.","","978-1-4673-7540-5;9781467375405","","10.1109/CCIntelS.2015.7437886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437886","Intrusion Detection;Trust;Wireless Sensor Network","Discrete wavelet transforms;Intrusion detection;Magnetic domains;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","distributed trust based intrusion detection approach;indirect trust;malicious attacks;node mobility;recommendation trust;trust decay over time;wireless sensor network","","","","12","","","7-8 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via nave bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection.

The proposed mechanism is based on identifying outlier measurements inside each cell, as well as corroboration among neighboring cells in a hierarchical structure to identify cells with significant number of malicious nodes. We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against attackers with varying degrees of sophistication.

Proceedings. 22nd International Symposium on","20031020","2003","","","260","269","A large class of security attacks exploit software implementation vulnerabilities such as unchecked buffers. This paper proposes transparent runtime randomization (TRR), a generalized approach for protecting against a wide range of security attacks. TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible.

In this paper we come up with an efficient machine learning approach to detect anomalous payloads. The approach uses n-gram preprocessing to extract words included in the payload. Bayesian inference is used to learn normal and anomalous traffic patterns from the words extracted during training. During the operational phase each incoming network packet is evaluated by the learning algorithm and the payload is declared as normal or anomalous based on the patterns previously learnt. This approach is tested on CSIC 2010 HTTP Dataset.

However even though market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact to overall system cost. How the synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length is presented.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that a benign majority of nodes prevail over malicious attacking nodes as they are able to accurately classify network nodes based on reputation estimations.","","978-1-4244-4155-6;9781424441556","978-0-7695-3649-1;9780769536491","10.1109/CNSR.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939153","Computer Network Security;Cooperative Systems;Mobile Communication","Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer graphics;Cryptography;Data security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Uncertainty","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","cooperative intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network nodes;network reliability;network security;reputation exchange;trust evaluation","","5","","17","","","11-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed algorithm, a normal profile is constructed from normal mobility patterns of mobile nodes in mobile wireless networks. From the constructed normal profile, the dissimilarity is computed by a weighted dissimilarity measure. If the computed dissimilarity value is greater than the dissimilarity threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message is occurred. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. From the result of the simulation, we know that the proposed method is superior to the performance of anomaly detection methods using other dissimilarity measures.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283011","Anomaly Detection;Dissimilarity Measures;Mobile Wireless Networks;Mobility Pattern","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Pollution measurement;Weight measurement;Wireless networks","mobile radio;telecommunication security","mobile wireless network;mobility pattern;network identity theft;network intrusion;weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection","","0","","8","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel method to improve the performance of IDS based on multimedia traffic classification. In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream. Otherwise, an anomaly is detected and reported.

During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

A new network anomaly detection method has been proposed in this paper. The main idea of the method is network traffic is analyzed and estimated by using Relative Entropy Theory (RET), and a network anomaly detection model based on RET is designed as well. The numerical value of relative entropy is used to alleviate the inherent contradictions between improving detection rate and reducing false alarm rate, which is more precise and can effectively reduce the error of estimation. On the 1999 DARPA/Lincoln Laboratory IDS evaluation data set, the detection results showed that the method can reach a higher detection rate at the premise of low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3643-9;9780769536439","","10.1109/ISECS.2009.174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209889","anomaly detection;evaluation data;intrusion detection;relative entropy theory","Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Detection algorithms;Electronic commerce;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Signal analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication traffic","intrusion detection;network anomaly detection method;network traffic;relative entropy theory","","2","","17","","","22-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers have proposed the IDS with different techniques to achieve the best accuracy with the consolidation of Clustering and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Clustering and ANN based models give better precision rate with better accuracy where attack records are low. Nevertheless, all the features of dataset are not relevant for classifying different attacks. So, feature selection can improve the stability and accuracy of IDS. In this paper, it is proposed that IDS with the amalgamation of best efficient features selected by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce the computational complexity of the system. It has been combined with the K-means clustering technique to cluster the specific groups of attacks and Artificial Neural Network to get a preeminent output by training the formulation of different base models. The model name has been defined by FP-ANK model.

IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system","","0-7695-0951-7;0769509517","","10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905436","","Authorization;Computer industry;Computer network reliability;Explosives;Information security;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graph theory;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","GrIDS;Internet security;University of California;coordinated network attacks;graph based intrusion detection system;graphical techniques;large networks;network characteristics;network traffic analysis;subgraph isomorphism;system performance;valid network activity","","0","3","6","","","2001","31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Sui Song; C. N. Manikopoulos","","2006 IEEE Information Assurance Workshop","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","1","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main advantage of the method is that no domain knowledge is required for designing feature extraction or any other part, as such knowledge is inferred by Neural Networks. Evaluation has been performed with traffic traces of real bot binaries executed in a lab setup. The method is trained on labelled Intrusion Detection System alerts and is capable of correctly predicting which of seven incidents an alert pertains, 56.15% of the times. Based on the observed performance it is concluded that the task of understanding Intrusion Detection System alerts can be handled by a Neural Network, showing the potential for reducing the need for manual processing of alerts. Finally, it should be noted that, this is achieved without any feature engineering and with no use of domain specific knowledge.","","","","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2016.7502344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502344","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Neurons;Training","invasive software;neural nets;pattern clustering","bot malware infections;enable botmaster;form botnets;intrusion detection alerts;intrusion detection systems;neural network;pattern clustering","","","","","","","13-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
