Most of works which aim to protect these components generally consist in developing protections (or countermeasures) taken one by one. But this countermeasure-centered approach drastically decreases the performances of the whole chip in terms of power and speed. Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures. One processor embeds the state-of-the-art set of countermeasures and executes the application code. The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor. We show that our approach enables the secure circuit's designer to easily fine tune the strategy of security, for example, of Pay-TV applications and could, in the future, be used to optimise dynamically the trade-off between performance and security.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4244-8705-9;9781424487059","978-1-4244-8703-5;9781424487035","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5721145","","Cryptography;Hardware;Monitoring;Sensors;Smart cards;Software","embedded systems;security of data;software architecture","complex strategy;countermeasure centered approach;double processor architecture;intrusion detection system;secret information recovery;secure embedded system","","0","","9","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","0-7803-9410-0;0780394100","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","20","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A crucial issue in designing such algorithms is incorporating knowledge about the environment, as well as what knowledge an adversary might have, into the scanning algorithm to improve detection performance. In particular, if such knowledge is initially incomplete, it becomes desirable to adapt one's knowledge based upon the results of the scanning activities, so as to further improve detection performance. To obtain insight into this problem, we suggest a Bayesian game-theoretical model of bandwidth scanning with learning. We show that such knowledge could change the structure of the strategies employed from distributing effort among all the bands, to band-sharing or even band on/off strategies and improve detection performance. Also, we have shown that a lack of information for the scanner compare to the adversary makes the scanner strategy more sensitive to the information he has.","","","","10.1109/WIFS.2015.7368564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368564","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Bayes methods;Cognitive radio;Games;Intrusion detection","Bayes methods;game theory;radio spectrum management;telecommunication security","Bayesian game-theoretical model;band-sharing;bandwidth scanning;scanning strategy;security;spectrum sharing;wireless system","","","","25","","","16-19 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sikdar","Goldman Sachs, Jersey City, NJ","IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","20100415","2010","9","4","1380","1389","This paper proposes a mechanism for detecting session hijacking attacks in wireless networks. The proposed scheme is based on using a wavelet based analysis of the received signal strength. We first develop a model to describe the changes in the received signal strength of a wireless station during a session hijack, while the received signal is embedded in colored noise caused by fading wireless channels. An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges. The detection mechanism is validated using both simulation and experimental results. The detector is shown to be reliable, computationally inexpensive and have minimal impact on the network performance.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.081447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441359","Network security, intrusion detection.","Colored noise;Computational modeling;Fading;Filters;Frequency;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wireless networks","safety systems;telecommunication security;time series;wavelet transforms;wireless channels","fading wireless channels;optimal filter;power spectral density;received signal strength;session hijacks;wavelet based analysis;wavelet transform;wireless networks","","1","","13","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed IDS considers two types of sink mobility: periodic and random.

The SPIE system has been proven to work effectively and efficiently for IP version 4, largely because an IPv4 packet has sufficient entropy in the first 28 bytes to allow the hash functions to uniquely identify each packet.

GNP is an evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as genes instead of strings (Genetic Algorithm) or trees (Genetic Programming), leading to creating compact programs and implicitly memorizing past action sequences. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database which contains both discrete and continuous attributes.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise. To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","17","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an approach to intrusion detection that combines HIDS, NIDS, and a version of IPsec that encrypts the header and the body of IP packets separately (Two-Zone IPsec). We show that all of the network events currently detectable by the Snort NIDS on unencrypted network traffic are also detectable on encrypted network traffic using this approach. The NIDS detects network-level events that HIDSs have trouble detecting and HIDSs detect application-level events that can't be detected by the NIDS.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-1512-0;9781424415120","978-1-4244-1513-7;9781424415137","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455095","","Cryptography;Electrostatic precipitators;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Payloads;Performance analysis;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","22","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A layered decision model for cost-effective network defense","H. Wei; D. Frincke; J. Alves-Foss; T. Soule; H. Pforsich","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Idaho Univ., Moscow, ID, USA","IRI -2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Conf, 2005.","20050912","2005","","","506","511","Network safeguarding practices involve decisions in at least three areas: identification of well-defined security policies, selection of cost-effective defense strategies and implementation of real-time defense tactics. Although choices made in each of these three affect the others, many existing decision models handle these three decision areas in isolation. There is no comprehensive tool that can integrate them to provide a single efficient model for safeguarding a network. In addition, there is no clear way to determine which particular combinations of defense decisions result in cost-effective solutions. To address these problems, this paper introduces a layered decision model (LDM) for use in deciding how to address defense decisions based on cost-effectiveness. To illustrate the technique, the LDM model is applied to the design of network defense for a sample e-commercial business. While there is a proliferation of tools for decision support, the connectivity between decisions about security policies, defense strategies and defense tactics is weak and there is no guarantee that these decisions are consistent. It is also hard to tell how a cost decision of one kind (e.g., about goals) affects cost outcomes at another level (e.g., regarding tactics). We present a layered decision model to support consistent, connected decisions at three layers: security policies, defense strategies, and defense tactics, and to balance costs at all layers. The layered decision model (LDM) integrates decisions about security policies, defense strategies and defense tactics in a uniform framework. In addition, this model provides an analytical framework that allows traceability of costs between layers. This framework combines risk assessment, business cost modeling, and cost-benefit analysis which uses return on investment (ROI) analysis. The work in this paper is preliminary, but should provide a good foundation for future work in this area.","","0-7803-9093-8;0780390938","","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506524","","Computer science;Cost benefit analysis;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Investments;Protection;Real time systems;Risk analysis;Risk management;Security","computer networks;cost-benefit analysis;decision support systems;risk management;security of data;telecommunication security","business cost modeling;cost-benefit analysis;cost-effective defense strategy;cost-effective network defense;decision support tool;e-commercial business;layered decision model;network safeguard;real-time defense tactic;return on investment analysis;risk assessment;security policy","","1","","23","","","15-17 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the concerns associated with to the protection of a railway area, indeed, relies on the unavoidable presence of the railroad tracks that cannot be practically obstructed with physical barriers. We propose an integrated optical fiber sensing system, composed by FBGs strain sensors, deployed in a network, to detect human intrusion through the perimeter to be protected, combined with FBG accelerometers sensors to protect the rail track access. Several trials have been carried out in indoor and even outdoor environment. Experimental results reveal that FBGs strain sensors, bonded under a ribbed rubber mat, enable the detection of intruder's break-in and FBG accelerometer sensors, installed under rails, enable the detection of walking intruder on the railroad tracks through the acoustic surface waves generated by the footsteps.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","7","4","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.","2327-4662;23274662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940213","Intrusion detection;Service Attacks;Service-oriented vehicular;intrusion detection;networks;service attacks;service-oriented vehicular networks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Road traffic;Service-oriented architecture;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Wireless networks","computer network security;data communication;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","DoS;ELIDV;ITS;NS-3 simulator;VANET;denial of service;efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network;false alert generation;high-rate data communication;integrity target;intelligent transportation system;low false positive rate;malicious detection;road-side units;service-oriented vehicular network;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless network","","2","","23","","2014-10-30","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes.

In this work we conduct a complex experiment to expand our understanding of forensics analysis processes. During a period of four weeks we systematically investigated 200 detected security incidents about compromised hosts within a large operational network. We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences. For example, we observe that good signatures check on average 2.14 times more bytes and 2.3 times more fields than regular signatures. Our analysis of Snort signatures is essential not only for configuring Snort, but also for establishing best practices and for teaching how to write new IDS signatures.","","978-1-4799-0458-7;9781479904587","","10.1109/SPW.2013.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565238","IDS;Infections;Malware;Network forensics","Correlators;Forensics;Malware;Manuals;Reconnaissance;Search engines","digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software;search engines","IDS signatures;Snort alerts;Snort signatures;blacklists;evidence collection;evidence correlation;malware;network forensics analysis;operational environment;reconnaissance;search engine;security data sources;security incident manual forensics investigation;vulnerability scanners","","4","","25","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs.

Alternatively, the regex can be converted to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for efficient matching, which however may require an extremely large state transition table (STT) due to exponential state explosion [17, 27]. We propose the segmented regex-NFA (SR-NFA) architecture, where the regex is first compiled into modular nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), then partitioned, optimized, and matched efficiently on modern multi-core processors. SR-NFA offers attack-resilient multi-gigabit per second matching throughput, does not suffer from either backtracking or state explosion, and can be rapidly constructed. For regex sets that construct a DFA with moderate state explosion, i.e., on average 200k states in the STT, the proposed SR-NFA is 367k times faster to construct and update and use 23k times less memory than the DFA approach. Running on an 8-core 2.6 GHz Opteron platform, our prototype achieves 2.2 Gbps average matching throughput for regex sets with up to 4,000 SR-NFA states per regex set.","1089-795X;1089795X","978-1-4577-1794-9;9781457717949","","10.1109/PACT.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113850","NFA;Regular expression;bit-level parallelism;multi-core processor;thread-level parallelism","Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Multicore processing;Throughput;Vectors","backtracking;finite automata;multiprocessing systems","SR-NFA architecture;attack-resilient multigigabit per second;backtracking;deterministic finite automaton;exponential state explosion;large state transition table;modular nondeterministic finite automata;multicore processor;multicore system;regular expression matching","","3","","27","","","10-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection parameters are numerous and in many cases they present uncertain and imprecise causal relationships which can affect attack types. A Bayesian Network (BN) is known as graphical modeling tool used to model decision problems containing uncertainty. In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. A major difficulty of this system is that the uncertainty on parameters can have two origins. The first source of uncertainty comes from the uncertain character of information due to a natural variability resulting from stochastic phenomena. The second source of uncertainty is related to the imprecise and incomplete character of information due to a lack of knowledge. The goal of this work is to propose a method to propagate both the stochastic and the epistemic uncertainties, coming respectively from the uncertain and imprecise character of information, through the Bayesian model, in an intrusion detection context.","","978-1-4244-4171-6;9781424441716","978-1-4244-4173-0;9781424441730","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137285","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Context modeling;Intrusion detection;Marine vehicles;Protection;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Tellurium;Uncertainty","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;stochastic processes","Bayesian network;epistemic uncertainty;graphical modeling tool;hybrid propagation;intrusion detection;learning;model decision problem;signature recognition;stochastic phenomena","","0","","15","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, malicious nodes in a wireless and mobile ad hoc environment can jeopardize the security of the network if the issues of secure data exchange are not properly handled. Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks. In our protocol, only trustworthy nodes are allowed to participate in communications and the misbehavior of malicious nodes is thus prevented effectively. We describe our protocol and provide its performance evaluation based on simulation experiments implemented in an ns-2 simulator.

The architecture's approach to naming and addressing fundamentally differs from the approach used in the current Internet. Great care is taken to distinguish between names and addresses. Names are used to identify entities and generally have a large scope. Addresses, however, are used to locate entities within a limited scope and are consequently not necessarily globally significant. These properties in particular create additional challenges when capturing and analysing network traffic as evidence. The paper shows that the architecture is well-suited for a distributed systems approach to forensics and that the network architecture increases the potential sources of reliable evidence.","2330-9881;23309881","978-1-4577-1481-8;9781457714818","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027506","Future Internet;RINA;digital forensics","Computer architecture;Forensics;Internet;Protocols;Relays;Resource management;Routing","IP networks;Internet;computer forensics;transport protocols","TCP/IP model;architecture network forensic;clean slate Internet architecture;distributed systems approach;network forensic implication;network traffic analysis","","0","","15","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DDoS dataset with various direct and derived attributes is generated in an experimental testbed which has 14 attributes and 10 types of latest DDoS attack classes. Using the generated DDoS dataset the Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM) is used for detection of the attacks into various classes.

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user.

Compared to the existing security solutions for VANETs, The proposed framework is more resilient to context changes that are common in VANETs, such as those due to malicious nodes altering their attack patterns over time or rapid changes in environmental factors, such as the motion speed and transmission range. We compare our framework to existing approaches and present evaluation results obtained from simulation studies.","","","","10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7391162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7391162","","Ad hoc networks;Context;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Support vector machines;Temperature","support vector machines;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","SVM-CASE;SVM-based context aware security framework;VANET;malicious attacks;support vector machine;vehicular ad-hoc networks","","","","11","","","6-9 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","2154-0217;21540217","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion. The results on 1998 DARPA data show that the our method results in low false positive rate with high detection rate.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4244-1717-9;9781424417179","978-1-4244-1718-6;9781424417186","10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4582476","","Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Sequences;Surveillance","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","fuzzy HMM;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;pattern recognition","","4","","12","","","3-5 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in this paper we propose a novel approach, combining systemic and behavioral features focusing on the CMD phase that the attacker sends commands to the victim. Through the detection method driven in this article, at first we gather the systemic and behavioral alerts produced while the attacker is installing and utilizing the backdoor interactively and then categorize them by specific features selected to give scores to the both aspects seen. Scores are given in two steps. The first step based on the prominent systemic alerts selected which are specified to backdoors and in the second step we give scores to the behavior it has in the command phase by creating and running a Markov Model. Literally, the scores are normalized and aggregated to determine the probability of backdoor residence on the computer monitored. We evaluated the algorithm in six different scenarios and by a group of well-known backdoors to make distinction between the proposed method and prior works.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2015.7387910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387910","Backdoor;Intrusion detection;Markov Model;Security","Computers;Information security;Malware;Markov processes;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","Markov processes;computer network security","CMD phase;Markov model;attacker;backdoor residence;behavioral features;computer system;network attacks;normal authentication methods;system based backdoor detection;systemic alerts","","","","12","","","8-10 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions.

Several diagnostic tools such as Ganglia, Ambari, and Cloudera Manager are available to monitor health of a cluster, however, they do not provide algorithms to detect security threats or perform user activity monitoring. Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable system that can detect malicious user activities, especially in real-time, so that appropriate actions can be taken against the user. At eBay, we developed such a system named Eagle, which collects audit logs from Hadoop clusters and applications running on them, analyzes users behavior, generates profiles per user of the system, and predicts anomalous user activities based on their prior profiles. Eagle is a highly scalable system, capable of monitoring multiple eBay clusters in real-time. It includes machine-learning algorithms that create user profiles based on the user's history of activities. As far as we know, this is the first activity monitoring system on the Hadoop-ecosystem for the detection of intrusion-related activities using behavior-based profiles of users. When a user performs any operation in the cluster, Eagle matches current user action against his prior activity pattern and raises alarm if it suspects anomalous action. We investigate two machine-learning algorithms: density estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we introduce the Eagle system, discuss the algorithms in detail, and show performance results. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the density estimation algorithm is 93%, however the sensitivity of our system increases by 4.94% (on average) to 98% (approximately) by using an ensemble of the two algorithms during anomaly detection.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363892","Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster;machine learning;user activity monitoring;user profiles","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Training","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","Big data analytics;Eagle system;Hadoop cluster;Hadoop-ecosystem;PCA;density estimation;eBay;intrusion-related activity;machine-learning algorithm;principal component analysis;security threat;user profile-based anomaly detection","","","","30","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An immune based intrusion detection algorithm for relational databases was proposed. According to the algorithm, the data to be detected were encoded into binary strings after preprocessing. The philosophy of negative selection in biological immune systems was utilized to generate immune detectors. Intrusion detection was fulfilled by comparing the strings of audit data with immune detectors. Experiments were designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Based on the same test data, the detection results of proposed algorithm were compared with those of other two detection algorithms: an association rule mining based detection algorithm and a sequential pattern mining based detection algorithm. The results show that the immune based intrusion detection algorithm for relational databases is more effective than the other two algorithms in reducing the false alarm ratio and promoting correctness ratio.","","978-0-7695-3745-0;9780769537450","","10.1109/HIS.2009.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254585","association rule;database;immune;intrusion detection;sequential pattern mining","Algorithm design and analysis;Association rules;Biological information theory;Data mining;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Relational databases;Sequential analysis","data mining;relational databases;security of data","association rule mining;binary strings;biological immune system;false alarm ratio;immune based intrusion detection algorithm;relational database system;sequential pattern mining","","3","","12","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we examine the limitations of a layered approach to security in mobile networks. We consider a detection framework that encompasses multiple layers of the node's protocol stack using cross-layer communications. We discuss the functional advantages of the parameter interactions in intrusion detection, with regard to a few parameters. We present the metrics that characterize an efficient detection system and analyze the benefits of a multi-level intrusion detection architecture.","1545-0678;15450678","0-7695-2838-4;0769528384","0-7695-2838-4;0769528384","10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278997","","Buildings;Communication system security;Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;mobile radio;probability;protocols;telecommunication security","Bayes method;cross-layer communication;distributed wireless mobile network;intrusion detection architecture;protocol stack","","0","","10","","","22-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
