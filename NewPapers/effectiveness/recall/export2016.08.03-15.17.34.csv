Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","2329-6267;23296267","978-1-4244-3763-4;9781424437634","","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6;9781424460236","978-1-4244-6024-3;9781424460243","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate). We evaluate our approach in terms of performance (live detection) and accuracy based on a data set from our partner, Creos Luxembourg S.A., the electricity grid operator in Luxembourg.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436414","","Context;Monitoring;Network topology;Smart grids;Smart meters;Topology","energy consumption;smart power grids","Creos Luxembourg S.A;advanced software monitoring;alerting system;automated device control;automated meter reading;communication technology;context-dependent consumption;electricity grid;energy consumption;information technology;live machine learning;smart grid;suspicious consumption value detection;suspicious electric consumption detection;two-way communication","","","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories. This cascaded classifier approach increases the detection rates of both rare network attack categories and also it increase overall detection rate of an IDS model. The higher detection rates are due to the mitigation of the influence from the dominant categories if the rare attack categories are separated from the dataset.","","978-1-4673-1599-9;9781467315999","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206789","Adaboost;Bayesian Network;detection rate;dominant attacks;rare attacks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost;Bayesian Network Classifier;R2L attacks;U2R attacks;cascaded classifier approach;increase detection rate;network intrusion detection;rare network attack categories;unequal distributed attack","","0","","13","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a single point of failure . We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152 seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme.

The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection).

Many of the existing energy efficient routing protocols utilize the power management feature provided by MAC layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 PSM). The rationale behind these protocols is to power down (put in sleep) the redundant nodes that do not involve in the packets routing. To keep a low end-to-end latency and preserve the routing fidelity, a group of nodes are selected to constitute a virtual backbone throughout the network. The backbone nodes do not sleep all the time serving for the packets routing while the rest of nodes turn to sleep mode if there is no packet to send or receive. Backbone nodes are periodically selected and replaced; the current selection and replacement mechanism mainly concerns the energy balance and fairness among the network nodes while the security threat is not considered. In this paper, we present that the adversary may launch security attacks against the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the backbone node selection algorithm. To address this problem, we propose a biased random selection algorithm to prevent the security attacks. The evaluation results indicate that with the aid of reputation system, the proposed biased random selection scheme is more secure than the random selection scheme while trading for a limited amount of power efficiency.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698160","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Energy management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power system management;Protocols;Routing;Spine","access protocols;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAC layer;biased random selection algorithm;energy efficient routing protocol;power saving;secure virtual backbone-based power management;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6;9781479956586","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric.

One problem with current implementations, however, is the sheer number of alerts they can generate, many of which tend to be false alarms. This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task. In this paper we explore three-dimensional approaches to visualizing network intrusion detection system alerts and aggregated network statistics in order to provide the system administrator with a better picture of the events occurring on his or her network. While some research has been done using two-dimensional concepts, 3D approaches have not received much attention with regard to detecting network intrusions. Evaluation of our visualizations using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set demonstrates the potential benefit of utilizing the third dimension. We show how a number of attack types in the data set generate visual evidence of abnormal activity that a security administrator might use as motivation for further investigation.","","0-7803-9477-1;0780394771","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532073","","Computer interfaces;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Data visualization;Graphical user interfaces;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection","data visualisation;security of data","1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set;abnormal network activity;aggregated network statistics;data reduction;network intrusion detection system;three-dimensional visualization;visual evidence generation","","3","7","13","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper gives details of how the PDS 100 PIDS was set up to meet these requirements at an operational site with 30 detection zones. The procedures used were designed to be rigorous enough to ensure that the performance was acceptable, yet quick enough to minimise the time spent commissioning. The tests are based on a calibrated, nondestructive fence tester used to simulate real cutting attacks on the fence. Data from attack trials were used to correlate the signals from real attacks and the fence tester. The commissioning procedure involved one person striking each fence panel, while the generated signals were automatically recorded on a portable computer.

They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876","","Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems","","4","","15","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normally such detection methods require payload or packet content analysis. One of the prominent method of payload modeling and analysis is sequence or ngram modeling. Normally ngrams generated from a packet are compared with a database of ngrams seen during training phase. Depending on the number of ngrams found or not found in the packet it is labeled either as normal or anomalous. Previous methods use either presence or absence of ngram in training dataset or use frequency of its occurrence in the entire training dataset. This approach results into many false positives and false negatives. In this paper we propose a novel payload analysis technique for the detection of Zero day attacks against web traffic. We consider the minimum and maximum occurrence frequency of a particular ngram from a packet in training dataset and find deviations from this range to detect anomalies.

This is due to the flawed assumption that an attacker does not have any information about an ADS. Advanced persistent threats that are capable of monitoring network behavior can always estimate some information about ADSs which makes these ADSs susceptible to evasion attacks. Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks. Case studies are presented to illustrate the design methodology and extensive experimentation is performed to corroborate the results.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346858","","Detectors;Entropy;Estimation;Grippers;Intrusion detection;Parameter estimation","computer network security","anomaly detection system evasion;evade detection;intrusion detection system;key based randomization scheme;launch evasion attack;parameter estimation attacks","","","","24","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Above all, the data set is classified into two clusters by FCM. Then, support vector machine (SVM) with a fuzzy membership function is to testify whether the data set can be further classified. Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process.

Sensor networks have emerged as a platform for deployment and sustenance of critical applications that require real-time sensing and data acquisition for decision-making purposes. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

When present, the intruder chooses how to corrupt the data. The second type models virus attacks.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","5","","41","","2012-03-21","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The new sequences are then fed to a naive Bayes supervised classifier (SC2.2) that builds class conditional probabilities from Markov modeling of system call sequences. The results of our proposed two-stage (that is clustering followed by classification) intrusion detection system on the 1999 DARPA dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab show significant performance improvements in terms of false positive rate, while maintaining a high detection rate when compared with other classifiers.

Low processing power and wireless connectivity make such networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. The dense deployment of sensors along with the protocol deficiencies, make broadcast attacks feasible. The current solutions for these types of attacks are mainly cryptographic and suffer from either heavy computational complexity or lack of mobility support. In this paper we propose an energy efficient method to fortify sensor networks against broadcast attacks using some key features of such networks like small transmission range and low reception-sensitivity. The main idea relies on modifying the reply timings of current MAC sub-layer protocols and embedding a two or three-way handshake protocol in broadcast scenarios so that the adversary receives a negative feedback from the network in response to his greediness in infecting nodes.

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept. A total of 22 cyber-physical scenarios are mapped into CEG and Bayesian networks to define rules for cyber-power system events.","1932-5517;19325517","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939285","Bayesian network;CEG;EDS;cyber-physical;scenarios;synchrophasor","Bayes methods;Circuit faults;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Relays","belief networks;graph theory;phasor measurement;power transmission lines;power transmission protection","Bayesian networks;IEEE 9 bus system;causal event graph;cyber-physical attack threats;cyber-power system events;event detection systems;multizone distance protection;power system event identification;robust monitoring systems;synchrophasor technology;transmission lines","","0","","18","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","2325-5552;23255552","978-1-4244-8454-6;9781424484546","978-1-4244-8455-3;9781424484553","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such algorithms are widely used for testing intrusion detection systems. We investigate the notion of completeness of a mutation algorithm: its capability to generate all possible attack instances from a given set of attack transformations. We define the notion of a Phi-complete mutation algorithm. Given a set of transformations Phi, an algorithm is complete with respect to Phi, if it can generate every instance that the transformations in Phi derive. We show that if the rules in Phi are uniform and reversible then a Phi-complete algorithm exists. Intuitively speaking, uniform and reversible transformations mean that we can first exclusively apply transformations that simplify the attack, then exclusively apply transformations that complicate it, and still get all possible instances that are derived by the rules in Phi. Although uniformity and reversibility may appear severe restrictions, we show that common attack transformations are indeed uniform and reversible. Therefore, our Phi-complete algorithm can be incorporated into existing testing tools for intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, we show that a Phi-complete algorithm is useful, not only for testing purposes, but also for determining whether two packet traces are two different mutations of the same attack","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2615-2;0769526152","","10.1109/CSFW.2006.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648707","","Computer security;Conferences;Encoding;Feeds;Genetic mutations;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;System testing;TCPIP;Uniform resource locators","security of data","Phi-complete mutation algorithm;attack mutation algorithms;attack transformations;intrusion detection systems;reversible transformations;transformations Phi;uniform transformations","","0","15","29","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","2","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. The efficiency of this method has been evaluated by the data set originated from New Mexico University.","","0-7803-8403-2;0780384032","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382325","","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Speech recognition;Text recognition","artificial intelligence;hidden Markov models;radial basis function networks;security of data","artificial intelligence tool;hard decision process;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;neural network model;profile database;radial basis function model","","1","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
