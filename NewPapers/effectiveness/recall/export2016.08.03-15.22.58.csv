One difficulty to counter these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use spoofed source IP addresses to hide their original source. This paper presents a new IP traceback scheme, called Probabilistic Flow Marking (PFM). The goal is to trace anonymous flooding attacks on the network back toward their original source, even if the source is located behind a network address translation (NAT) or a proxy device. In this approach, PFM embeds a fingerprint in the packets randomly. This enables PFM to identify the origin of the traffic traversing through the Internet on a per flow basis, regardless of the source IP address spoofing. We evaluate PFM on three real-life Internet data sets from the CAIDA archives. Our evaluation results show that compared to the previous IP traceback schemes, PFM significantly decreases the number of marked packets required to traceback and represents a step forward in terms of performance and deployability.","","978-1-4673-8050-8;9781467380508","","10.1109/RNDM.2015.7325234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325234","DDoS Attacks;Flow Base IP Traceback;Network Security;Probabilistic Flow Marking","Computer crime;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Network interfaces;Probabilistic logic","Internet;computer network security","CAIDA archives;IP traceback scheme;IP traceback schemes;Internet;NAT;PFM;anonymous flooding attacks;distributed-denial-of-service attacks;network address translation;probabilistic flow marking;proxy device;security issues;source IP address spoofing;spoofed source IP addresses","","","","20","","","5-7 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives. This is caused by the unstable nature of the wireless medium and also because of the difficulty to model the behaviour of the diverse implementations from different manufacturers. One way to reduce false positives is to combine different techniques to carry out the analysis. We propose a novel method that identifies the impersonation of certain management frames, which helps to reduce the number of false positives within other existing MAC spoofing detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529384","802.11 MAC address spoofing;false positive","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Personal digital assistants;Protocols","access protocols;computational complexity;message authentication;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 network;beacon MAC frame spoofing attack detection;management frame authentication;protocol","","1","","26","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

As misuse detection considers predefined signatures for intrusion detection, here we have proposed two phases of intrusion detection mechanism.

This phase has been tested with our university intranet web server's log file. We have tested successfully the SQL injection for unauthorized access.

The shared feature set consisted of features agreed by the two feature selection algorithms and therefore considered important features for identifying intrusions. Human intervention was then conducted to find an optimal number of features in between the combined (maximum) and shared feature sets (minimum). Empirical results showed that the proposed feature set gave equivalent results compared to the feature sets generated by the selected feature selection methods, and combined feature sets.","","978-0-7695-3595-1;9780769535951","","10.1109/ICIME.2009.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077013","Bayesian Networks;Feature Selection;Network Intrusion Detection","Computational efficiency;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Face detection;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;belief networks;security of data","feature selection approach;human intervention;intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection","","4","","19","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.","","978-1-4577-0531-1;9781457705311","978-0-7695-4423-6;9780769544236","10.1109/SAINT.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129","OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data","feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data","","3","","16","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

Among the possible approaches to improve the current situation, expert systems have been advocated to be an important one. Typical tasks that such expert systems attempt to achieve include finding system vulnerabilities and detecting malicious behaviour of users. We extend our intrusion detection system ASAX with a deductive subsystem that allows us to assess the security level of a software configuration on a real time basis. By coupling the two subsystems-intrusion detection and configuration analysis-we moreover achieve a better tuning of the intrusion detection since the system has only to enable intrusion detection rules that are specifically required by the current state of the configuration.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3168-7;9780769531687","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","37","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","6","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It also examines a variety of methods that have been employed or postulated to simulate these cutting and climbing attacks.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the principle that networks should allow users to focus on data, rather than having a reference to a physical location where that data is, the adoption of new paradigms can be justified. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm that gives a potential improvement to content distribution, such as local content caching, which helps to reduce delay and increase delivery speed. From another point of view, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) defines a new Internet architecture where network devices are simple and the control plane is managed by a centralized controller, providing an inexpensive and reliable architecture. This paper presents ContentSDN, an architecture that integrates ICN and SDN, providing transparent in-network caching for content delivery. ContentSDN uses the concept of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), allowing network orchestration and high scalability at runtime. Content caching is driven by manageable policies that can be adjusted according to business needs. The proposed architecture has been evaluated on an emulated environment where multiple users request content through the HTTP protocol. Results show that ContentSDN improves the Quality of Experience and make a more efficient use of network resources.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-5090-1857-4;9781509018574","","10.1109/AINA.2016.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474135","Information-Centric Networking (ICN);Network Functions Virtualization (NFV);Software-Defined Networking (SDN)","Computer architecture;Control systems;IP networks;Internet;Proposals;Protocols","Internet;computer architecture;content management;quality of experience;software defined networking;transport protocols;virtualisation","ContentSDN;HTTP protocol;ICN;Internet paradigm;NFV;business needs;content distribution;content-based paradigm;content-based transparent proxy architecture;information-centric networking;location-based paradigm;network functions virtualization;quality of experience;software-defined networking","","","","25","","","23-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While most of the attacks go undetected, they are detrimental for the availability of the Internet services, and the security and privacy of clients and networks. We designed and developed a system, we call LUDIC (LookUp DIstributed Cache), for detection of domain hijacking attacks. Our system also enables forensic analysis and provides victims with signed evidences allowing them to prove breaches to third parties, such as a court of law or a resolution authority. LUDIC uses distributed vantage points to validate DNS records, and does not require establishing a chain of trust to a centralised trust anchor, hence sidestepping the adoption challenges inherent in DNSSEC. Our system does not introduce any changes to the existing infrastructure and can be easily integrated into an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or a firewall, while providing an immediate benefit to adopters.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417736","","Computer crime;Databases;Forensics;History;Internet;Servers","Internet;digital forensics;firewalls","DNS;DNSSEC;IDS;Internet service;LUDIC;centralised trust anchor;domain hijacking attack;domain name system;firewall;forensics;intrusion detection system;lookup distributed cache;security mechanism","","","","34","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic. We conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed detection scheme against the C-Worm.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing.

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead.

Intrusion detection systems are evaluated objectively and comprehensively by the method of entropy weight coefficient.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606135","evaluation;fuzzy comprehensive evaluation;intrusion detection system;network security","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Educational institutions;Electronic commerce;Entropy;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Mathematics","entropy;performance index;security of data;software performance evaluation","entropy weight coefficient;evaluation metrics;intrusion detection systems;performance indexes","","1","","17","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new firewall model based on the proposed connection tracking mechanism is then developed and extended from the basic model of Net filter's Conn Track module, which has been used by many early generation commercial and open source firewalls including IPTABLES, the most popular firewall. To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed. The experimental results show that our model performs more efficiently in comparison with the Net filter/IPTABLES.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011242","Connection Tracking;Firewall;Network Security;Stateful firewall;Tree-rule firewall","Computational modeling;Filtering;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Memory management;Ports (Computers)","Linux;firewalls","IPTABLES;Linux Cent OS 6.3;Netfilter ConnTrack module;Netfilter model;connection tracking mechanism;designated tree structure;firewall rules;generation commercial;hashing bits;memory space;open source firewalls;stateful mechanism;tree-rule firewall model","","0","","24","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But current anomaly detectors monitor application behavior at a high level of detail, and many irrelevant variations in that behavior can cause false alarms. This paper discusses the preprocessing of audit data ultimately used by application-based anomaly detection systems. The goal is to create a more abstract picture of program behavior filtering out many irrelevant details. Our specific approach automatically identifies repeating sub-sequences of behavior events and sequences of events that always occur together. The main benefit of this preprocessing technique can be used with a wide variety of program-based anomaly detectors, but we present empirical results showing how it improves the performance of the well-known stide anomaly detection system.","","0-7695-1897-4;0769518974","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194881","","Data analysis;Detectors;Filtering;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Object detection;Performance analysis;Vocabulary","auditing;security of data","application-based anomaly detection systems;application-based anomaly detectors;audit data preprocessing;baseline model;intrusion;normal application behavior;program behavior data vocabulary;repeating sub-sequences","","2","","27","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","4","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most penetration testing can hope for is to be the science of insecurity - not the science of security nasmuch as penetration testing can at most prove insecurity by falsifying the hypothesis that any system, network, or application is secure. To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, Art is a lie that shows the truth and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility. Brisk technical advance equals productivity growth and thereby wealth creation, so it is forbidden to long for a day when penetration testing could achieve the status of science.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-1828-1;0769518281","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176290","","Art;Automation;Diseases;Fires;Performance evaluation;Productivity;Security;System testing;Terminology","computer testing;security of data","falsifiable hypotheses;insecurity;penetration testing;potential insecurities;security;vulnerabilities","","11","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For those training data excluded from the profile, we use them to build a specific classifier. The classifier has two distinct characteristics: one is that it regards each data point in the feature space with the limited influence scope, which is served as the decisive bounds of the classifier, and the other is that it has the default label to recognize those novel attacks. We present a novel classification algorithm, influence-based classification algorithm, to deal with ambiguous data. Our system is tested on the KDD Cup 1999 data.

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","2162-8998;21628998","978-0-7695-3843-3;9780769538433","978-1-4244-5068-8;9781424450688","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application.

One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, even several efforts have been made in the area of Intrusion Detection Systems for cloud computing environment, many attacks still prevail. Therefore, the work presented in this paper proposes a multi-criteria analysis and a comparative study between several IDS architectures designed to work in cloud computing environments. To achieve this objective, in the first place we will search in the state of the art for several consistent IDS architectures designed to work in a cloud environment. Whereas, in a second step we will establish the criteria that will be useful for the evaluation of architectures. Later, using the approach of multi-criteria decision analysis MacBeth (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) we will evaluate the criteria and assign to each one the appropriate weight according to their importance in the field of IDS architectures in cloud computing.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.","","","","10.1109/EDCC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950","IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring","Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters","embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management","SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem","","","","47","","","7-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","1060-9857;10609857","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets since neither source nodes nor destination nodes have the knowledge of where or when the packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a malicious nodes detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping attack where the malicious node drops one or more packets and then injects new fake packets instead. Our novel detection and traceback mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. Each node can detect and then traceback the malicious nodes based on a solid and powerful idea that is, Merkle tree hashing technique. In our defense techniques we have two stages. The first stage is to detect the attack, and the second stage is to find the malicious nodes. We have compared our approach with the acknowledgement based mechanisms and the networks coding based mechanism which are well known approaches in the literature. Simulation results show this robust mechanism achieves a very high accuracy and detection rate.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396496","Denial-of-Service;Malicious Node Detection;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attacks;Security","Australia;Electronic mail;Information technology;Network coding;Routing;Security;Wireless communication","computer network security;cryptography","Merkle tree hashing technique;acknowledgement based mechanisms;destination nodes;malicious node traceback;malicious nodes detection mechanism;networks coding based mechanism;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attack;source nodes","","","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4673-0228-9;9781467302289","978-1-4673-0227-2;9781467302272","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders becoming smarter in obfuscating web requests to evade detection combined with increasing volumes of web traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-hosted and on-premise business applications have made it evident that the existing approaches of mostly static signature lack the ability to cope with novel signatures. A SQLIA detection and prevention solution can be achieved through exploring an alternative bio-inspired supervised learning approach that uses input of labelled dataset of numerical attributes in classifying true positives and negatives. We present in this paper a Numerical Encoding to Tame SQLIA (NETsQlIA) that implements a proof of concept for scalable numerical encoding of features to a dataset attributes with labelled class obtained from deep web traffic analysis. In the numerical attributes encoding: the model leverages proxy in the interception and decryption of web traffic. The intercepted web requests are then assembled for front-end SQL parsing and pattern matching by applying traditional Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This paper is intended for a technique of numerical attributes extraction of any size primed as an input dataset to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented using Two-Class Averaged Perceptron (TCAP) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TCLR) respectively.

The attribute independence issue associated with Naive Bayes has been resolved through the development of the Average One Dependence Estimator (AODE) algorithm. In this paper, we propose the application of AODE for intrusion detection. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied and analyzed on the KDD-99 intrusion benchmark data set.

VoIP networks are a popular, low-cost alternative for telephony that offer lower rates especially for long-distance calls. Other services such as FollowMe, enhance the traditional voice-oriented nature of these networks. Consequently several security concerns such as fraud calls, are related to the high availability required by a VoIP system. Fraud calls account for an average loss of 3% to 5% of the operators' revenue. Thus the detection and prevention of the users from behaving in a non-conforming way, becomes crucial. A trustworthy and secure management and billing scheme is necessary, to guarantee the proper operation. This work proposes a behavioral control scheme for the VoIP clients. An initial training period defines the normal behavior. Then statistical analysis and t-testing is employed to extract results regarding the users' profiles, with pre-defined confidence levels. A Buffer zone creates a more flexible decision-making process. The scheme also offers the ability to configure its parameters, in order to react appropriately under different network conditions and detect possible misuses. It is implemented and its rational operation is verified via several simulation scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511103","Intrusion Detection System;T-testing;VoIP fraud detection;non-conforming behaviour;security","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Quality of service;Statistical analysis;Training","Internet telephony;decision making;statistical analysis","VoIP-based network systems;decision-making process;hypothesis testing;nonconforming behavior detection;statistical analysis;t-testing","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these HTTP-GET requests have legitimate formats and are sent via normal TCP connections, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can not detect them. In this paper, we propose HTTP-GET flood detection techniques based on analysis of page access behavior. We propose two detection algorithms, one is focusing on a browsing order of pages and the other is focusing on a correlation with browsing time to page information size.

In this paper, we present efficient schemes for analyzing and optimizing the time duration for which the intrusion detection systems need to remain active in a mobile ad hoc network. A probabilistic model is proposed that makes use of cooperation between IDSs among neighborhood nodes to reduce their individual active time. Usually, an IDS has to run all the time on every node to oversee the network behavior. This can turn out to be a costly overhead for a battery-powered mobile device in terms of power and computational resources. Hence, in this work our aim is to reduce the duration of active time of the IDSs without compromising on their effectiveness. To validate our proposed approach, we model the interactions between IDSs as a multi-player cooperative game in which the players have partially cooperative and partially conflicting goals.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4244-2201-2;9781424422012","978-1-4244-2202-9;9781424422029","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
