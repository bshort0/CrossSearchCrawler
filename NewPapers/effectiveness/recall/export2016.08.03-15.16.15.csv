"Towards an Information-Theoretic Approach for Measuring Intelligent False Alarm Reduction in Intrusion Detection","Y. Meng; L. f. Kwok","Dept. of Comput.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Annual","20081222","2008","","","367","376","Anomaly detection (AD) sensors compute behavior profiles to recognize malicious or anomalous activities. The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts. Our experimental results based on wireless behavior profiles from users in the CRAWDAD dataset show that the volume of false alerts generated by cluster-based AD sensors is reduced by at least 50% compared to single-profile AD sensors.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3447-3;9780769534473","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721573","Behavior Profile Clustering;False Alert Reduction;Network-based Anomaly Detection Sensors;Wireless Users","Application software;Collaboration;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Performance analysis;Robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches","security of data","anomalous activity;anomalous behavior identification;anomaly detection sensor;behavior-profile clustering;cluster-based AD sensor;false alert reduction;malicious activity;wireless behavior profile","","2","","16","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706;10636706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","6","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Inspired by the neurons of biological nervous systems, they emit short voltage pulses, the static pixels with a frequency proportional to light intensity, the dynamic pixels whenever they detect a relative change in irradiance. The pulses are transmitted off-chip by the address event representation (AER) protocol, i.e. via a digital bus as the identifying address of the sending pixel. For the motion pixels, this read-out strategy has the advantage of low latency in the order of 100 ns after a change is encountered. (Whereas a scanning read-out strategy would on average suffer a delay of half of the frame scanning period.) Mounted on a pan-tilt system, the peripheral motion detectors could, for instance, be used to steer the imager such that the image of a moving object falls onto the central pixel array where it can then be examined in detail at a higher resolution.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy.

Our dynamic multisource multipath routing algorithm design integrates with a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm to remove malicious nodes from the sensor network.

One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","1","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the design of a new anomaly detection system for each node of the network, which contains detection subsystem for MAC layer, routing layer and application layer. Audit data taken from MAC level/network level/application level from the traces in Glomosim and are preprocessed separately for each layer's detection subsystem. Feature data sets for each layer are selected from normal transactions. The detection subsystem contains normal profiles obtained from the feature vectors of training data sets. In our work, we used Bayesian classification algorithm, Markov chain construction algorithm and association rule mining algorithm for anomaly detection in MAC layer, routing layer and application layer respectively for effective intrusion detection.

"Network intrusion detection system using L1-norm PCA","C. Khalid; E. Zyad; B.

For this reason, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been developed in order to detect and prevent computer network attacks. However, the majority of IDSs operate on huge network traffic data with many useless and redundant features. Consequently, the IDS generates a lot of false alarms and the intrusion detection process becomes difficult and imprecise. To improve the performance of an IDS, many data dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), have been proposed. However, the classical PCA approach, that is based on the covariance matrix of the data, is very sensitive to outliers. In order to overcome this problem, we propose to introduce a new variant of PCA namely L1-norm PCA. This new method is based on the L1-norm maximization, which is more robust to outliers, instead of the Euclidean norm in the classical PCA. Extensive experiments on the well-known KDDcup99 dataset are exploited for testing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Obtained results confirm the superiority of L1-norm PCA over the traditional PCA in terms of network attacks detection and false alarms reduction.","","","","10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492755","","Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Probes;Training","computer network security;data reduction;optimisation;principal component analysis","L1-norm PCA;L1-norm maximization;computer network attacks;data dimensionality reduction methods;information and communication technologies;network intrusion detection system;network traffic data;principal component analysis","","","","14","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performance of the classifier is an essential concern in terms of its effectiveness; also number of feature to be examined by the IDS should be improved. In our work, we have proposed two techniques, C4.5 Decision tree algorithm and C4.5 Decision tree with Pruning, using feature selection.

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

This paper discusses a means by which perimeter alarm systems can be combined to reduce the Nuisance Alarm Rate or False Alarm Rate (FAR) without compromising the Detection Rate (DR). Alarm systems operate on different principles and so have different strengths and weaknesses. Here we report work the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) has conducted on combining complementary systems to reduce the FAR that would result from using either system on its own. We have ANDed a Video Motion Detection (VMD) System and a fence mounted microphonic Perimeter Intrusion Detection System. If each simultaneously goes into alarm, an operator is alerted. ANDing is not a new concept and has been used before, but not as far as we know to combine a Video Motion Detector (VMD) with a Fence Mounted System (FMS) at a real problem site. This paper reports and discusses the results from several operational trials of this combination of detectors.

This study presents a cross-breed type feature selection approach using duo filter schemes for intrusion detection. In this framework feature selection technique eliminate the irrelevant features to reduce the time complexity and build a better model to predict the result with a greater accuracy and Bayesian network based classification model has been built up to predict the types of attacks. The experiment shows that the proposed framework exhibits a superior overall performance in terms of accuracy which is 97.2746% and keeps the false positive rate at a lower rate of 0.008. The model shows better performance in terms of accuracy than other leading state-of-the-arts frameworks like Boosted DT, Hidden NB, KNN and Markov chain.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an extension for HoneydV6 which allows the detection, extraction and analyses of shellcode contained in IPv6 network attacks. The shellcode detection is based on the open source library libemu and combined with the online malware analysis tool Anubis. We compared the shellcode detection rate of HoneydV6 and Dionaea.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216;15312216","1-4244-0000-7;1424400007","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1;9781479915941","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A good way to identify malicious use is through monitoring unusual user activity. To identify these malicious activities various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. This paper proposes Self Configuring Intrusion Detection System (SCIDS) to make tuning automatically. The key idea is to use the binary SLIPPER as a basic module, which is a rule learner based on confidence-rated boosting. This system is evaluated using the NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset.

According to the feature optimization selection problems of the rare attack categories detection, this paper proposes using the cascaded SVM classifiers to classify the non-rare attack categories and using BN classifiers to classify rare attack categories, combining with cascaded GFR feature selection method (CGFR).

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920  1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The aim of our research is to reduce the amount of data retained for processing i.e., attribute selection process and also to improve the detection rate of the existing IDS using data mining technique. We then use improved Kuok fuzzy data mining algorithm, which in turn a modified version of APRIORI algorithm, for implementing fuzzy rules, which allows us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We applied fuzzy inference engine using mamdani inference mechanism with three variable inputs for faster decision making.

TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route. Using analysis and simulation results, we show that the TUF architecture is effective in thwarting a wide range of attacks, including protocol-compliant (also known as JellyFish) attacks.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150899","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer security;Cryptography;Information security;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Snow;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;TUF architecture;cross-layer technique;goodput monitoring;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer;protocol-compliant attacks;route rebuilding process;routing disruption denial-of-service attacks;secure routing architecture;throughput-feedback routing;transport layer","","2","","20","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7;9781467355247","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is of great importance to design an efficient intrusion detection scheme (IDS) for WSNs. In this study, the authors propose a novel IDS based on energy prediction (IDSEP) in cluster-based WSNs. The main idea of IDSEP is to detect malicious nodes based on energy consumption of sensor nodes. Sensor nodes with abnormal energy consumption are identified as malicious ones. Furthermore, IDSEP is designed to differentiate categories of ongoing DoS attacks based on energy consumption thresholds. The simulation results show that IDSEP detects and recognises malicious nodes effectively.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6543339","","","computer network security;energy consumption;wireless sensor networks","DoS;IDSEP;WSN;abnormal energy consumption;cluster-based wireless sensor networks;denial-of-service attacks;energy prediction;intrusion detection scheme;malicious nodes;sensor nodes;wireless communication broadcast nature","","1","","","","","June 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes the new intrusion detection technique by using hybrid methods of unsupervised/supervised learning scheme. The proposed technique integrates the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The PCA is applied to reduce high dimensional data vectors and distance between vectors including its projection onto the subspace.

We propose to support such applications by allowing the developer to annotate some transaction blocks with deadlines. Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves the chance of a transaction meeting its deadline when its progress is hampered by conflicts.","1530-0889;15300889","978-1-4244-9232-9;9781424492329","978-1-4244-9231-2;9781424492312","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958224","Contention Management;Scheduling;Transactional Memory","Games;Instruction sets;Linux;Optimized production technology;Rendering (computer graphics);Reservoirs;Runtime","Linux;concurrency control;multi-threading;scheduling;shared memory systems;transaction processing","Deadline-Aware Scheduling;Linux scheduler;Software Transactional Memory;concurrency control;conservative execution;parallel programs;thread migration;transaction execution strategy","","1","","25","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4577-2135-9;9781457721359","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","2","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","1063-6897;10636897","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","40","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527;10639527","0-7695-2716-7;0769527167","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
