It is absolutely necessary to use algorithmic models to defend against these threats. However, all models are sensitive to deviation from the original contexts in which the models were developed. Hence, it is not really an overstatement to say that `all models are wrong'. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics loop for supporting the continuous development of models during their deployment. We describe the roles of three types of operators (monitors, analysts and modelers), present the visualization techniques used at different stages of model development, and demonstrate the utility of this approach in conjunction with a prototype software system for corporate insider threat detection. In many ways, our environment facilitates an agile approach to the development and deployment of models in cybersecurity.","","","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2015.7312767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312767","","Analytical models;Data models;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Reliability;Visual analytics","business data processing;data analysis;data visualisation;security of data","agile approach;corporate insider threat detection;cybersecurity threats;model development;prototype software system;visual analytics loop;visualization techniques","","","","36","","","25-25 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model.

This paper proposes a bio-inspired approach to describe the adaptive behavior of a particular service and the formation of composite components representing the constituent services. The paper depicts the policies to be used as rules by which adaptive behaviors can be specified prior to, or even during, execution. For a composite service, these policies are refined and applied to its constituent services, thus facilitating automatic refinement of high level policies to- lower level policies executable appropriate constituent service.

Structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging reduce the difference between this variant and the original program to a minimal repair. We describe the algorithm and report experimental results of its success on 16 programs totaling 1.25 M lines of C code and 120K lines of module code, spanning eight classes of defects, in 357 seconds, on average.

Hingston","Sch. of Comput. & Security Sci., Edith Cowan Univ., Perth, WA, Australia","IT Convergence and Security (ICITCS), 2015 5th International Conference on","20151008","2015","","","1","5","With the enormous growth of users reliance on the Internet, the need for secure and reliable computer networks also increases. A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","31","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7;9781479900787","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel hypothesis in immunology, the danger theory (DT), is emerging to meet these challenges. DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal. In order to reduce the false positive and increase robustness for detection system, a notion of multi-tissues cooperation to sense dangers in IDS is also demonstrated based on the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2113-8;9781424421138","978-1-4244-2114-5;9781424421145","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593657","Danger Theory;Data Field;Intrusion Detection;Tissue","Artificial immune systems;Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Context awareness;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Signal processing","pattern clustering;security of data","antigen data clustering;antigen presentation;bioinspired multitissues growing algorithm;danger theory;data fields;intrusion detection system","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI.

For the structural-cluster approach, protein structural segments are grouped into different structural clusters using multiple structural alignments and unsupervised clustering algorithms. The support vector machine (SVM) has shown superior classification performance in various bioinformatics applications because of its strong generalization capability. In order to overcome disadvantages of building one SVM over the whole sample space, the clustering support vector machine (CSVM) was proposed to predict distance matrices, torsion angles, and secondary structures for backbone -carbon atoms of protein sequence segments. The special features of CSVMs enable the training tasks for each CSVM to be parallelized.

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack.

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept.

High degree parallel architecture of the coprocessor allows it to run at line rate above 20 Gbps without packet losing. Furthermore, the coprocessor has deterministic search time and low memory consumption. By using Netfilter hooks in Linux network protocol stack MPC8260 manages the coprocessor to take the full charge of packet classification, so the performance of the system is not influenced much when multi-dimensional packet classification executed.

Identifying traffic anomalies rapidly and accurately is critical to network stability and usefulness. Most papers focus on analyzing the volume of data or packets on the network. However, legitimate network traffic may be bursty or highly variable, rendering such naive approaches ineffective (Lakhina et al., 2005). We propose a novel method called MultiA to solve this problem. Rather than just looking at volumes of packets, MultiA intelligently adopted multistage filter and information entropy take into account the behavior of the network.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network Lab., Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","20140711","2014","9","8","1278","1287","Network security against possible attacks involves making decisions under uncertainty. Not only may one be ignorant of the place, the power, or the time of potential attacks, one may also be largely ignorant of the attacker's purpose. To illustrate this phenomenon, this paper proposes a simple Bayesian game-theoretic model of allocating defensive (scanning) effort among nodes of a network in which a network's defender does not know the adversary's motivation for intruding on the network, e.g., to bring the maximal damage to the network (for example, to steal credit card numbers or information on bank accounts stored there) or to infiltrate the network for other purposes (for example, to corrupt nodes for a further distributed denial of service botnet attack on servers). Due to limited defensive capabilities, the defender faces the dilemma of either: 1) focusing on increasing defense of the most valuable nodes, and in turn, increasing the chance for the adversary to sneak into the network through less valuable nodes or 2) taking care of defense of all the nodes, and in turn, reducing the level of defense of the most valuable ones. An explicit solution to this dilemma is suggested based on the information available to the defender, and it is shown how this information allows the authorities to increase the efficiency of a network's defense. Some interesting properties of the rivals' strategies are presented. Notably, the adversary's strategy has a node-sharing structure and the adversary's payoffs have a discontinuous dependence on the probability of the attack's type. This discontinuity implies that the defender has to take into account the human factor since some threshold values of this inclination in the adversary's behavior could make the defender's policy very sensitive to small perturbations, while in other situations it produces minimal impact.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2329241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827188","Bayesian equilibrium;computer networks;infrastructure networks;network protection;scan;search","Bayes methods;Computers;Forensics;Games;Jamming;Security;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision making;game theory;human factors;probability","Bayesian game-theoretic model;adversary behavior;adversary motivation;adversary strategy;attack-type uncertainty;decision making;defensive capabilities;defensive effort;distributed denial of service botnet attack;human factor;network defender;network protection;network security;node-sharing structure","","8","","36","","2014-06-06","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods. To tackle cyber scanning campaigns, this paper uniquely reports on the analysis of two recent cyber scanning incidents. Finally, several concluding remarks are discussed.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2013.102913.00020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657498","Cyber scanning;Network reconnaissance;Probing;Probing campaigns;Scanning events","Cyberspace;Internet;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols;Servers","Internet;security of data","Internet wide services;cyber scanning technique;distributed cyber scanning detection method;enterprise networks;targeted cyber attack","","2","","113","","2013-11-07","Third Quarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Another is a misuse detection technique called Clustering. Each technique determines an intrusion warning (IW) level for each audit event. The IW levels from different intrusion detection techniques are then combined using a fusion technique into a composite IW level, 0 for normal, 1 for intrusive, and any value in between to signify, the intrusiveness.

By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN). Therefore, IIDS is able to detect the intrusions/attacks both from the outer Internet and an inner LAN.

This paper proposes supervised nonlinear learning method S-H-Isomap which utilized class labels to measure the dissimilarity between data points and replaced Euclidean distance with HVDM distance (Heterogeneous distance function).

The efficiency of AIDS relies on the quality of the training data. Many prior studies encounter the problem of low hit rates and high false alarms. In this paper, we study the relationship between the user behavior in terms of operating system commands and the success rate of detection.

Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification.

Our technical approach is based on the theory of unknown input observability. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the misbehavior to be observable and for the identity of the faulty node to be detectable. Second, we design a distributed unknown input estimator, and we characterize its convergence rate in the equal-neighbor model and in the general case.

One of the researches introduced a fast method to detect attacks using modified information entropy (so called Fast Entropy). Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme. In addition, we found that Dynamic AFEA can enhance detection level more than fixed (non-dynamic) one when it is equipped with Fast Entropy.","","978-1-61284-733-7;9781612847337","978-0-7695-4372-7;9780769543727","10.1109/IMIS.2011.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976144","DDoS;Dynamic Adaptive Detector;Entropy based approach;Fast Infromatin Entropy","Accuracy;Computer crime;Detectors;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring","Internet;entropy;security of data","Internet;adaptive DDoS attack detection using fast entropy approach;adaptive threshold shifting;distributed denial-of-service attacks;dynamic detection window size","","1","","11","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We contribute to both theory and practice of this phenomenon by presenting a new interference model that precisely explains it and using extensive experiments to validate it.

But, the plug-in-and-play architecture of WMNs paves way for malicious users who could exploit some loopholes of the underlying routing protocol. A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network.

To the outside, all ports and all IP addresses appear open in an OpenFire network. OpenFire uses the honeypot concept in its design. However, unlike traditional honeypots, OpenFire attempts to present additional false targets by making it appear to an attacker that all ports, including unused ones, and all unused IP addresses of an organization are open, with the thesis that this will help divert attacks from real services to false services. In our experiments, we defined an attack to be snorts priority 1 alert. During a 21-day evaluation period, we found that OpenFire reduced the number of attacks on real services by 65% as compared to an unprotected system and by 46% as compared to a Honeypot-protected system.

These proposed machine learning based IDSs come in addition to the already deployed signatures which are already in use in conventional intrusion detection systems like Snort-Wireless and Kismet. In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529352","Denial of Service;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Networks","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Detectors;Floods;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","GP based IDS;Kismet;Snort-Wireless;WiFi networks;data link layer;genetic programming;intrusion detection system;machine learning;wireless networks","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtual Machines (VMs) are one of the key components of cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The security of such VMs is critical to IaaS security. Many studies have been done on cloud computing security issues, but research into VM security issues, especially regarding VM network traffic anomalous behavior detection, remains inadequate. More and more studies show that communication among internal nodes exhibits complex patterns. Communication among VMs in cloud computing is invisible. Researchers find such issues challenging, and few solutions have been proposed???leaving cloud computing vulnerable to network attacks. This paper proposes a model that uses Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to implement traffic redirection. Our model can capture inter-VM traffic, detect known and unknown anomalous network behaviors, adopt hybrid techniques to analyze VM network behaviors, and control network systems. The experimental results indicate that the effectiveness of our approach is greater than 90%, and prove the feasibility of the model.","","","","10.1109/TST.2016.7488743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488743","anomaly detection;cloud computing;network behavior;virtual machine","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Decision analysis;Security;Virtual machining;Virtualization","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS.

So it is important to investigate distributed monitoring mechanism appropriate for ad hoc networks.

Detecting such potentially unknown sequences is the core problem in intrusion detection. In this paper, we focus on the problem of observing attacks over non-uniform, partially asynchronous event sets. We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naive model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection. We also provide a simple example of an application of the model for the case of an intrusion detection system on a co-processor observing a host, although the model is intended for arbitrary non-uniform architectures and concurrent operations.","2330-9881;23309881","978-1-4673-2160-0;9781467321600","","10.1109/ISSA.2012.6320435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320435","Intrusion detection;asynchronous and partially asynchronous observation;causality models","Cryptography","security of data","arbitrary nonuniform architectures;attack causality;causal dependencies;charactering attacks;concurrent operations;coprocessor;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;modern computing architecture;naive model;nontrivial attack;partially asynchronous event sets;partially asynchronous observation;partially ordered sets","","0","","16","","","15-17 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IDSs generate a high amount of false alerts exceeding the administrator ability for analysis and omit several attacks which can threaten the network security. In this paper, a two-stage process based on data mining and optimization is proposed having as input the outcome of multiple IDSs. In the first stage, for each IDS the set of elementary alerts is clustered to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove false positives from the sets of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the second stage, we discard the meta-alerts generated by all IDSs and only those missed by one, two or most of them are left. This set is called the set of potential false negatives. In fact, at this level a meta-alerts fusion is performed to avoid the redundancy between meta-alerts collected from multiple IDSs. Finally, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify the potential false negatives either as real attacks or not. Experimental results show that our proposed process outperforms concurrent methods by significantly reducing the rate of false positives and false negatives.","","978-1-4673-8659-3;9781467386593","","10.1109/CIS.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397096","binary classification;binary optimization;clustering;false negatives;false positives;intrusion detection systems","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Redundancy;Security;Testing;Training","computer network security;data mining;optimisation;pattern classification","IDS;binary classification algorithm;binary optimization problem;computer network protection;computer network security;data mining;elementary alerts;false alerts;false negative identification;false positive identification;intrusion detection systems;meta-alert fusion;security infrastructure;two-stage process","","","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
