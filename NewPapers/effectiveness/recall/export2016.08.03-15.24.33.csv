Counterfeiting in supply chain management is an attack with cloned and fraud RFID tags in order to gain illegal benefits. In this paper we will extend our previous work on a trust framework and construct a computational model for the trust management.

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In deep packet inspection, the contents of network traffic are matched against patterns of malicious traffic to identify attack-carrying packets. The pattern matching algorithms employed for deep packet inspection must be fast, as the algorithms are often implemented on middle-boxes residing on high-speed gigabits per second links. The majority of patterns employed in network security applications are regular languages. However, regular language-based patterns have limited expressive power and are not capable of describing some complex features in network payload. Back reference is an important feature provided by many pattern matching tools, e.g., PCRE, the regular expression libraries of Java, Perl, and Python. Back references are used to identify repeated patterns in input strings. Patterns containing back-references are non-regular languages. Very little work has been done to improve the time-efficiency of back reference-based pattern matching. The de facto algorithm to implement back reference is recursive backtracking, but it is vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement back references. The basic idea of our approach is to transform a back reference problem to a conditional submatch problem, and represent it with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)-like machine subject to some constraints. Our experimental results show that our approach resists known algorithmic complexity attacks, and is faster than PCRE by up to three orders of magnitude for certain types of patterns.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410264","Back reference;Finite automaton;Network-based Intrusion Detection System;Pattern matching","Resists","finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;security of data","NFA-like machine;back reference-based pattern matching algorithm;conditional submatch problem;de facto algorithm;firewalls;modern network security applications;network-based intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automata like machine;recursive backtracking;regular language-based patterns","","","","28","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method can be used to compare the performance of intrusion detectors, to evaluate performance goals for intrusion detectors, and to determine the best configuration of an intrusion detector for a given environment. The method uses a decision analysis that integrates and extends ROC (receiver operating characteristics) and cost analysis methods to provide an expected cost metric.

We demonstrate that, contrary to common advice, the value of an intrusion detection system and the optimal operation of that system depend not only on the system's ROC curve, but also on cost metrics and the hostility of the operating environment as summarized by the probability of intrusion.

"Lightweight IDS Based on Features Selection and IDS Classification Scheme","S. Zaman; F. Karray","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Computational Science and Engineering, 2009. CSE '09. International Conference on","20091009","2009","3","","365","370","The intrusion detection system (IDS) deals with huge amount of data which contains irrelevant and redundant features causing slow training and testing process, higher resource consumption as well as poor detection rate. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","3","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to overcome this threat, organizations apply enterprise content-aware data leakage prevention (DLP) solutions to monitor and control data access and usage. However, this paper argues that current solutions are not able to reliably protect information assets. The analyses of data breaches reported in 2014 reveal a significant number of data leakage incidents that are not within the focus of the DLP solutions. Furthermore, these analyses indicate that the classification of the provided data breach records is not qualified for detailed investigations. Therefore, advanced criteria for characterizing data leakage incidents are introduced, and the reported records are extended. The resulting analyses illustrate that DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) demand various information security (IS) measures to be established in order to reduce the risk of technologically based data breaches. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) measures is significantly influenced by non-technological aspects, such as the human factor.

Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics. We perform some experiments to explore the behavior of specific WSN application traffic.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy. As a result of finding imperfect self-region radius we have faced weak detectors that couldn't recognize anomaly perfectly.

Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)).

This paper describes a host-based IDS model, utilizing a Radial Basis Function neural network. It functions as a combined anomaly/misuse detector that helps to overcome most of the limitations in existing models.

However, a widespread adoption of this paradigm has been hampered by the lack of security mechanisms. In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To face this issue, the use of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has emerged as a key element in network and application security. In this paper we address the problem considering a novel statistical technique for detecting attacks towards the SIP protocol. Our approach is based on the use of Markovian models (namely high order Markov chains) for modelling SIP signalling traffic. In particular our work focuses on detection of three kinds of attacks: VoIP fuzzing, flood based denial of service, and signalling manipulation. The performance results shown in the paper, justify the proposed method and highlight the improvements over commonly used statistical techniques.","","978-1-4244-4165-5;9781424441655","978-1-56555-328-6;9781565553286","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224115","","Computer bugs;Electronic mail;Explosives;Floods;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet telephony;security of data;signalling protocols;telecommunication security","Internet;Markovian models;SIP protocol;SIP signalling traffic;VoIP;VoIP fuzzing attack;application security;attack detection;flood based denial of service;high order Markov chains;intrusion detection systems;security attacks;signalling manipulation","","0","","19","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, mobile botnets enable illegal access to a victim's smartphone and can compromise critical user data and launch a DDoS attack through Command and Control (C&C). In this paper, we propose a static analysis approach called DeDroid, to investigate botnet-specific properties that can be used to detect mobile botnets. Initially, we identify critical features by observing coding behavior of the few known malware binaries having C&C features. Then we compare the identified features with the Drebin dataset of malicious applications and come to the conclusion that Drebin dataset has 35 percent applications which qualify as botnets. To confirm this result, we used Virus Total as a reference point which also showed comparable results of botnet detection.","","","","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518419","Botnet Detection;Botware;Malware Detection;Mobile Botnet","Androids;Feature extraction;Humanoid robots;Malware;Mobile communication;Servers;Smart phones","","","","","","","","","10-14 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 37th Annual 2003 International Carnahan Conference on","20040518","2003","","","77","82","Tactical deployment of out-of-doors intrusion detection system sensors can be hazardous to law-enforcement personnel. There is a growing demand for deployment to be done secretly. Personnel are obliged to minimize their exposure to hazards and maximize mission effectiveness. Sensor hardware must be exceptionally low-cost in order to be left behind, or considered disposable. Recent developments in noncoherent synergistic radar (NCSR) allow the RF transmitter (sensor) and RF receiver (processing engine) to be deployed wirelessly up to three kilometers away from each other. A 'leaky cable' sensor (ported coax) provides a two-meter wide contour of detection, typically fifty to two hundred meters in length. A miniature antenna provides a two-meter, spherical point-of-detection. For the purpose of this paper, sensing elements include; nonmetallic baseball-sized artificial stones and tree branches, RF miniature antenna, battery circuit and logic. All of which priced to be left behind. The processing engine includes a portable receiver connected to a tripod-mounted directional antenna, located in a safe-zone far away from its related sensing elements. The receiver multiplexes, facilitating the processing of up to sixteen different frequency-coded transmitters (artificial stones). An alarm, resulting from an intrusion into any one of the sixteen spherical point zones is reported to wireless hand-held equipment. Results of a series of tactical field trials are published. Sensors (artificial stone) were secretly deposited by hand, dropped from aircraft or simply distributed using military artillery.","","0-7803-7882-2;0780378822","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297539","","Engines;Hardware;Hazards;Intrusion detection;Military aircraft;Personnel;Radar antennas;Radio frequency;Sensor systems;Transmitters","antennas;radar;radio receivers;radio transmitters;safety systems;security;sensors","RF miniature antenna;RF receiver;RF transmitter;frequency-coded transmitters;intrusion detection system sensor;law-enforcement personnel;leaky cable sensor;low-cost component;military artillery;noncoherent synergistic radar;nonmetallic baseball-sized artificial stones;portable sensor;processing engine;tripod-mounted directional antenna;wireless hand-held equipment","","0","","","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision. Our model also makes use of multiboosting for reducing both variance and bias.

We consider all network packets before they reach to the end-user by extracting a certain number of features of internet worm from these packets. Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors. Our approach provides good results with detection rate over 99.6 percent and false alarm rate is close to zero with Random forest algorithm. In addition, our model can classify behaviors of DoS and Port Scan attacks with detection rate higher than 98 percent and false alarm rate equal to zero.","","978-1-4244-6986-4;9781424469864","978-89-88678-20-6;9788988678206","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484868","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","","10","","","11-13 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each cluster is labeled by the user as anomaly or normal and then a decision tree is trained based on this information. The incoming new data is labeled according to the output of the decision tree.

Moreover, in order to provide realistic measures and analysis of darknet information, we report case studies, namely, Conficker worm in 2008 and 2009, Sality SIP scan botnet in 2011, and the largest amplification attack in 2014. Finally, we provide a taxonomy in relation to darknet technologies and identify research gaps that are related to three main darknet categories: deployment, traffic analysis, and visualization. Darknet projects are found to monitor various cyber threat activities and are distributed in one third of the global Internet. We further identify that Honeyd is probably the most practical tool to implement darknet sensors, and future deployment of darknet will include mobile-based VOIP technology. In addition, as far as darknet analysis is considered, computer worms and scanning activities are found to be the most common threats that can be investigated throughout darknet; Code Red and Slammer/Sapphire are the most analyzed worms. Furthermore, our study uncovers various lacks in darknet research. For instance, less than 1% of the contributions tackled distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) amplification investigations, and at most 2% of research works pinpointed spoofing activities.

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The insider threat involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the external threat involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495972","","Business;Computer vision;Data security;Government;Histograms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Testing","information systems;security of data","anomaly detection system;external threat detection;histograms;information access;information assurance;information dissemination;information systems;insider threat detection;intrusion detection system;outlier detection;sensitive information;system call feature representation;system call names;tamper resistance;trust;user privilege","","13","","18","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an alternative, anomaly based IDS use a model of what is considered a normal behavior of a computer system or network and then they could detect any attack, know or unknown. The main problem of this approach is to find an adequate model of normality. In this paper, we present a method to build a model of behavior of computer network and systems.
