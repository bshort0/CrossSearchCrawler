Along with EEG recordings, inter-ictal discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, structural placement of the epileptogenic zone and clinical description, are used in the study. The key step involved in the analysis, is to create an algorithm that shapes the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, identifying the features, forward modeling of the extracted features and finally classifying them as epileptic seizures arising from the location on the right or left region of the brain. The feature extraction is done by independent component analysis (ICA) with spatially filtered eight spectral features per components. These features are classified using Support Vector Machines with radial basis function kernels (SVM) and Proximal SVM. A comparative study is done for evaluating specificity and sensitivity using segments of ICA data. The analysis and results of both patients indicates that the specificity and sensitivity ratios are higher for ICA with SVM rather than those obtained from PSVM.

"Towards a unified approach to the representation of, and reasoning with, probabilistic risk information about software and its system interface","M. S.

ISSRE 2004. 15th International Symposium on","20050124","2004","","","391","402","Early risk assessment is key in planning the development of systems, including systems that involve software. Such risk assessment needs a combination of the following elements; 1) Severity estimates for the potential effects of failures, and likelihood estimates for their causes; 2) Fault trees that link causes to failures; 3) Efficacy estimates of design and process steps towards reducing risk; 4) Distinctions between preventing, alleviating and detecting (thereafter removing), risks; 5) Risk preventions that have potential side effects of themselves introducing risks. The paper shows a unified approach that accommodates all these elements. The approach combines fault trees (from probabilistic risk assessment methods) with explicit treatment of risk mitigations (a generalization of the notion of a detection seen in FMECA analyses). Fault trees capture the causal relationships by which failure mechanisms may combine to lead to failure modes. Risk mitigations encompass (and distinguish among) options to prevent risks, detect risks, and alleviate risks (i.e., decrease their impact should they occur). This approach has been embodied in extensions to a JPL-developed risk assessment tool, and is illustrated here on software risk assessment information drawn from an actual project's software system FMECA (failure modes, effects and criticality analysis). Since its elements are typical of risk assessment of software and its system interface, the findings should be relevant to a wide range of software systems.","1071-9458;10719458","0-7695-2215-7;0769522157","","10.1109/ISSRE.2004.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383134","Cost-benefit tradeoffs;FMEA;FMECA;FTA;Failure Modes;PRA;Probabilistic Risk Reduction;Risk-informed decision-making;SFMECA","Application software;Costs;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault trees;Protection;Risk analysis;Risk management;Software systems;Space vehicles","decision making;fault trees;maximum likelihood estimation;risk management;software development management","FTA;PRA;SFMECA;cost-benefit tradeoffs;failure modes;fault trees;probabilistic risk reduction;risk assessment;risk-informed decision-making;system interface","","7","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","1-4244-0355-3;1424403553","10.1109/ICC.2006.255097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492","","Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads","","","","2","","19","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The success rate of contest participants was evaluated in terms of the obtained classification cost. The classification cost of the contest winner was 0.2331, the best approach prior to our work carries the classification cost of 0.2224. We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662;21660662","978-1-4799-3857-5;9781479938575","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","19","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate the problem of distributed collaborative defense against coordinated attacks in MANET as a dynamic game problem. In our formulation we have on the one hand a group of attackers that observe what is going on in the network and coordinate their attack in an adaptive manner. On the other side, we have a group of defending nodes (the IDS nodes) that collaboratively observe the network and coordinate their actions against the attackers. Using extensions of the game theoretic framework of [3] we provide a mathematical framework for efficient identification of the worst attacks and damages that the attackers can achieve, as well as the best response of the defenders.

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The developed system is applied to different probing attacks.

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

This is because existing guidelines, IT standards and laws on security and privacy do not take virtual environments into account. Thus, they present a significant challenge for cloud providers to comply with. As a result, the cloud providers are unable to provide SMEs with an assurance. In order to address these privacy and security issues, this paper presents the Cloud Data Security (CloudDataSec) project that aims to design cloud services adhering to government privacy laws. In particular, this paper introduces a six-layer security model for cloud computing and three level of security assurance for SMEs to take advantage of.

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

Considering factors such as intrusion detection latency and a variety of parameters for real-time, Semi-Markov evaluation model for survival assessment is established. Based on this model, relevant quantitative criteria are made to define the important indicators of survivability, such as integrity and availability, so as to validate intrusion detection capability and the survivability of real-time database. The three important factors of false alarm, detection rate and the intensity of attack are analyzed in detail by the TPC-C benchmark.

It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors","Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning","Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol","","0","1","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of its huge success, most ensemble methods tend to generate unnecessary large number of classifiers, which entails an increase in memory storage, computational cost, and even a reduction of the generalization performance of the ensemble. Ensemble selection addresses these shortcomings by searching for a fraction of individual classifiers that performs as good as, or better than the entire ensemble. In this paper, we formulate the problem of ensemble selection as a coalitional game in a graph form, and name the approach ISCG-Ranking. The proposed game aims at capturing two crucial concepts that affect the performance of an ensemble: accuracy and diversity. Most importantly, it ranks every classifier based on its contribution in keeping a proper balance between these two notions using Shapley value. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art techniques on 26 UCI benchmark datasets. The results reveal that ISCG-Ranking significantly improves the original ensemble and performs better than other methods in most cases.","1082-3409;10823409","","","10.1109/ICTAI.2015.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372193","Coalitional Games;Core;Ensemble Pruning;Ensemble Selection;Ensemble of Classifiers;Game Theory;Induced Subgraph Games;Shapley Value","Computational efficiency;Game theory;Games;Information theory;Random variables;Resource management;Training","game theory;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CGT;ISCG-Ranking;Shapley value;UCI benchmark datasets;classifier;coalitional game theory;ensemble learning;ensemble selection;graph form;induced subgraph coalitional game","","","","44","","","9-11 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Computer security;Data security;Evolutionary computation;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;anomaly detection;evolutionary neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning techniques;program behavior;system-call audit data;system-call sequences","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","16","","25","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","40","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, especially in the routing layer because of their open environment and the communication happens based on the mutual trust among the nodes. An appropriate intrusion detection system is an inevitable requirement. Using anomaly based intrusion detection system results in the false positive identification of the intrusion. Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation.

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model.

During node mobility, there are possibilities for the malicious node to become the cluster head or cluster member. This causes the cluster or the whole network to be controlled by the malicious nodes. To offer high level of security, the mobile sensor nodes need to be authenticated. Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes. In addition, a bidirectional malicious node detection technique is employed which eliminates the malicious node from the network. By simulation, it is proved that the proposed technique provides efficient security with reduced energy consumption during node mobility.","1673-5447;16735447","","","10.1109/CC.2016.7513213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513213","cluster;dynamic key;heterogeneous;mobility;weight;wireless sensor network","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Energy efficiency;Heuristic algorithms;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","authenticated nodes;average distance;average speed;bidirectional malicious node detection technique;cluster based secure dynamic keying technique;cluster head;cluster member;data delivery;energy efficient routing;heterogeneous mobile wireless sensor networks;node degree;node mobility;sensor nodes;virtual battery power;weight value","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes.

Fuzzy cluster algorithm based on the similarity of attack attributes is proposed to classify alerts generated by IDSs. And then in every alert class, alert correlation method based on prerequisites and consequences of attacks is used to construct attack scenarios.

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-7476-2;0780374762","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","87","8","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) P<sub>X</sub> based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences. The obtained results are compared with a version of the game in which the pmf P<sub>X</sub> is perfectly known to both the analyst and the adversary.","0018-9448;00189448","","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2325571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824190","Hypothesis testing;adversarial signal processing;counter-forensics;cybersecurity;game theory;multimedia forensics;source identification","Forensics;Games;Multimedia communication;Nash equilibrium;Testing;Training","game theory;statistical testing","binary hypothesis testing game;decision error;first order statistics;game asymptotic equilibrium;game-theoretic framework;null hypothesis;probability mass function;test sequence","","3","","37","","2014-06-02","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted, in above 90% average accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate","2329-6267;23296267","1-4244-0700-1;1424407001","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219097","","Application software;Computational intelligence;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;File systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Software packages","Internet;computer viruses;data mining;pattern classification","World Wide Web;antivirus tools;background applications activity;classification algorithms;computer behavior;computer configurations;data mining;specific worm signatures;unknown computer worms activity;unknown worms detection","","2","1","31","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being a real-time service, VoIP is more susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks than regular Internet service. In this paper we proposed a change-point detection method to prevent denial-of-service attacks on VoIP systems based on session initiation protocol (SIP) protocol behavior analysis. We develop efficient adaptive sequential change-point method to detect attacks which lead to changes in network traffic. The change-point detection method employs a statistical analysis of data to detect very subtle traffic changes which from SIP protocol behavior. The method is computationally simple and can be implemented online. Our experimental result shows that the method achieves a very small delay, high rate and low false alarm rate of VoIP-specific DoS detection.","1738-9445;17389445","978-89-5519-138-7;9788955191387","978-89-5519-139-4;9788955191394","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809596","Denial-of-Service;Session Initiation Protocol;Voice over IP;change-point detect","Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;IP networks;Internet telephony;Network servers;Protocols;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Internet service;PSTN service;SIP;VoIP-specific denial-of-service detection;adaptive sequential change-point method;change-point detection method;network traffic;session initiation protocol protocol;statistical analysis;voice over IP technology","","1","","19","","","15-18 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
