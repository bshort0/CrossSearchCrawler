The proposed IDS is able to effectively detect an attack and is able to localize the attack source within one-hop perimeter. False positive rate is reduced through the decision module of the IDS where intelligence gathered from neighbor nodes is used to make a collaborative decision and Bayesian network is used to evaluate multiple attack sources.

Liu","Microsoft Corporation, Mountain View","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","2","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset.

Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive.

Hence by so doing, their weaknesses would be highlighted with a view to introducing other methods which offer better and more efficient benefits.

The aim of this article therefore is to take a deeper look at concepts within Network security systems (NSS) and especially that of membrane system. Furthermore, based on the inherent benefits of MC and areas where it has been applied successfully, we (i) project a link between it and NSS and (ii) propose MC as an alternative veritable tool towards solving some of the problems of NSS such as packet dropping in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which usually emanates from systems' inability to handle large traffic data. This was experimented using a model built on recognizer Tissue P system on GPU and the initial results obtained show that our method yields better detection speedup.","","978-1-4673-6778-3;9781467367783","","10.1109/ICEEI.2015.7352506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7352506","GPU;Intrusion Detection System;Membrane Computing;Network Security","Biomembranes;Communication networks;Computational modeling;Information science;Neurons;Parallel processing;Security","biocomputing;firewalls;graphics processing units;security of data;telecommunication traffic","GPU;IDS;MC;NSS;intrusion detection system;living biological cells;membrane computing;network security systems;packet dropping;recognizer tissue-P system;traffic data handling","","","","26","","","10-11 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4;9781424446384","978-1-4244-4639-1;9781424446391","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea behind IMS is convergence; providing a single interface to different traditional or modern networking architectures allowing better working environment for the end users. IMS is still not commercially adopted and used but research is in progress to explore it. IMS is an IP based overlay next generation network architecture. It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS. KNN classifier effectively distinguishes the behavior of the system as normal or intrusive and achieve low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-2823-6;9781424428236","","10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777775","3GPP;DoS;IDS;IMS;KNN;PCSCF","Computer crime;Convergence;Degradation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Next generation networking;Protocols;Quality of service;TCPIP","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;pattern classification;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","3GPP;IP multimedia subsystem;IP protocols;IP spoofing;OpenIMS core;TCP;UDP flooding;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbor classifier;overlay next generation network architecture;proxy call session control function;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","1","","29","","","23-24 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.","1082-3409;10823409","978-1-4244-5619-2;9781424456192","978-0-7695-3920-1;9780769539201","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617","","Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services","decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis","Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy","","2","","29","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, ATM uses a number of protocols for connection establishment and routing and if these protocols are not functioning correctly (e.g., due to misconfiguration, component failure or active attack), denial of service may result. Since ATM protocol irregularities occur below IP, they are not detectable by the IP intrusion detection systems that are prevalent in today's networks. This paper describes an implementation of an intrusion detection system that detects ATM protocol attacks. This system uses a centralized assessment engine to collect network event notifications from a distributed set of sensors. These sensors monitor ATM protocol activity and send the filtered events to the assessment engine. The assessment engine compares the incoming event traffic against a set of attack templates and, if a match is encountered, it (optionally) activates a set of responses. In addition, this paper describes results that have been obtained from the proof-of-concept implementation, along with initial experience with its use in operational networks. Future research directions that address other unique challenges presented by ATM intrusion detection and response are also described.","","0-7803-7225-5;0780372255","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985769","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Monitoring;Routing protocols;Search engines;Sensor systems;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","asynchronous transfer mode;protocols;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM protocol attacks;asynchronous transfer mode;centralized assessment engine;connection establishment protocols;denial of service;intrusion detection;network event notifications;routing protocols","","1","1","8","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various probabilistic techniques of intrusion detection, including decision tree, Hotelling's T<sup>2 </sup> test, chi-square multivariate test, and Markov chain are applied to the same training set and the same testing set of computer audit data for investigating the frequency property and the ordering property of computer audit data. The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection. However, unless the scalability problem of complex data models taking into account the ordering property of activity data is solved, intrusion detection techniques based on the frequency property provide a viable solution that produces good intrusion detection performance with low computational overhead","1083-4427;10834427","","","10.1109/3468.935043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935043","","Computer bugs;Decision trees;Frequency;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","Markov processes;auditing;decision trees;information systems;probability;security of data","Hotelling T<sup>2</sup> test;Markov chain;activity data;chi-square multivariate test;complex data models;computer audit data;decision tree;event sequence;frequency property;information system;intrusion detection;low computational overhead;multiple audit event types;probabilistic techniques","","60","12","57","","","Jul 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The system monitors events in the environment, constructs patterns of event sequences, and finds strange and anomalous patterns. If any dangerous symptoms are detected in the environment, the system matches them to the timeline of events and finds a pattern that may have caused the symptoms.

We propose in this work a new signal fingerprinting approach based on discrete wavelet transformer. Instead of being extracted from the transient part, the signal fingerprint is computed on a part of the signal related to the transmission of a definite sequence of bits. This sequence is expected to be transmitted by every base station antenna in the network.

In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters.

A large portion of scanning activity is of a slow scan type and is not currently detectable by security appliances. In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time. This technique provides insight into Internet traffic by classifying known activities, giving visibility to threats to the network through scan detection, while also extending awareness of the activities occurring on the network.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2109009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720528","Security and protection;system management;traffic analysis","Backscatter;Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Probes;Protocols;Sockets","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet traffic;activity information;malicious activity detection;network activity classification schema;packet-level data;periodicity;scan detection;scan probes;scanning activity;time 24 h","","9","","35","","2011-02-28","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile.

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination). We explore the security, cost, and accuracy of our protocol.","","0-7695-2375-7;0769523757","","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540983","","Costs;Directional antennas;Loss measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Protocols;Robustness;Security;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;data integrity;directive antennas;message authentication;mobile radio;monitoring;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","authenticity report;civilian application;data integrity;directional antenna;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring function;packet forwarding report;secure link layer acknowledgment;traffic forwarding activity;traffic measurement","","1","","20","","","17-21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tenth International Conference on","20080415","2008","","","216","223","A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.","","0-7695-3114-8;0769531148","","10.1109/UKSIM.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488934","distributed monitoring;fuzzy logic;internet security;intrusion prevention","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Real time systems;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","","","","6","","6","","","1-3 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","3","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data objects will be tagged with time semantics that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as normal transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

Interestingly, these two can present conflicting demands. We provide a first formulation of a new class of problems focusing on the engineering of attack-resistant networks. Our model considers both resiliency and security, and uses a notion of blocking probability as a rigorous measure for evaluating different network constructions. We propose several efficient approximation algorithms for computing blocking probability and provide bounds for their errors. Based on these algorithms, we introduce a family of heuristics to guide the construction of optimal attack-resistant networks with minimum blocking probabilities.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3;9781424484843","978-0-7695-4159-4;9780769541594","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","4","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These cybercrime activities has ultimately resulted in CC attack classification as a serious problem in network security domain while machine learning has been subjected to extensive research area in intrusion classification with emphasis on improving the rate of classifier's accuracy or improving the data mining model performance. This study is another attempt, using rough set theory (RST), a rule based decision making approach to extract rules for intrusion attacks classification. Experiments were performed on publicly available data to explore the performance of four different algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm, covering algorithm, LEM2 and Exhaustive algorithms. It is observed that RST classification based on genetic algorithm for rules generation yields best performance as compared to other mentioned rules generation algorithms. Moreover, by applying the proposed technique on publicly available dataset about intrusion attacks, the results show that the proposed approach can fully predict all intrusion attacks and also provides prior useful information to the security engineers or developers to conduct a mandating action.","","","","10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2015.7351952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351952","Classification;Cyber-terrorism;Cybercrime;Intrusion Prediction;Rough Set Theory","Approximation methods;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Genetic algorithms;Set theory;Yttrium","computer network security;data mining;decision making;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;smart phones","CC activity;CC attack classification;RST classification;cyber attack classification;cyber-crime activity;data mining model performance;electronic device;genetic algorithm;intrusion classification;machine learning;network security domain;rough set theory;rule generation algorithm;rule-based decision making approach;security threat;smart phone","","","","26","","","10-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k.

This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic.

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7;0769522947","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2906-4;9781467329064","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310","Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine","","Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity","","9","","23","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1;9781467356121","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It combines rich conceptual modeling of security knowledge with discrete event simulation and metaheuristic optimization techniques. By simulating attacks, the method infers possible routes of attack and identifies emergent weaknesses while accounting for adversaries' heterogeneous objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry.

It consists of selecting features using an entropy based feature selection algorithm which selects the important attributes and removes the irredundant attributes. This algorithm operates on the KDD-99 Data set; this data set is used worldwide for evaluating the performance of different intrusion detection systems. The next step is clustering phase using k-Means. We have used the KDD99 (knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) intrusion detection contest. This system can detect the intrusions and further classify them into four categories: Denial of Service (DoS), U2R (User to Root), R2L (Remote to Local), and probe. The main goal is to reduce the false alarm rate of IDS<sup>1</sup>.","","978-1-4577-0694-3;9781457706943","","10.1109/RAIT.2012.6194493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6194493","Classification;Clustering;KDD Cup 99 Data set;Nave Bayes;detection rate;false alarm rate;intrusion detection;k-Means","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;performance evaluation;security of data","Denial of Service;K-nearest neighbor;K-nearest neighbor classifiers;KDD-99 data set;KDD99 intrusion detection contest;Naiive Bayes classifiers;R2L;Remote to Local;U2R;User to Root;anomaly intrusion detection system;entropy based feature selection algorithm;false alarm rate reduction;hybrid intrusion detection system;irredundant attributes;k-mean clustering;knowledge discovery and data mining;performance evaluation","","15","","15","","","15-17 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The NIDS deals with the network layer raw data, the application layer connection session and user network behaviors. The NIDS monitors payload of packets on network layer and analyzes attacks on application layer through packets reassembly and statistical process. The system created profile using learning vector quantization (LVQ) and utilized the original LVQ algorithm to implement behavior classification. This approach exhibits the ability to detect the known and unknown network attacks. Experimental results show that the NIDS detect low-level network attacks effectively with low false positive rate and perform very well for detection of unknown attacks, especially for PROBE, DOS and U2R attacks","2160-133X;2160133X","1-4244-0061-9;1424400619","","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028520","Intrusion detection;KDD;LVQ;profile;state transition","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Master-slave;Payloads;Protocols;Queueing analysis;Signal design;Signal processing;Software prototyping","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis;vector quantisation","application layer connection session;hierarchical network intrusion detection system;learning vector quantization;low-level network attack;packet reassembly;statistical process;user network behavior","","0","","13","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The communications infrastructure of the SGI is prone to several malicious attacks identified in the recent past. Customer-specific electricity readings are communicated up the SGI hierarchy from consumer devices to centralized servers through intermediary devices such as smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators. In this paper, we model the attacks against the home area network of the SGI, through definition and generation of routine device behaviors. Any observed deviation from the defined normal profile is labeled as a malicious attack. Subsequently, we propose a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based approach towards training and testing of centralized SGI devices to qualify them for identifying anomalies accurately. The proposed scheme is capable of detecting anomalous readings within a consumer's household, with reasonable accuracies.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681021","Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection;Self-Organizing Maps;Smart Grid Communications","Electricity;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Smart grids;Training;Vectors","power engineering computing;security of data;self-organising feature maps;smart power grids","SGI communications infrastructure;SGI home area network;SOM-based approach;customer-specific electricity readings;data aggregators;data concentrators;electricity supply;intrusive activity detection;malicious attack;routine device behaviors;self-organizing maps;smart grid communications infrastructure;smart meters","","1","","12","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
