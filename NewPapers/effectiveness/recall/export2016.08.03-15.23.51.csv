And the need to protect connected systems also increases. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are the latest technology used for this purpose. Numerous soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents an approach based on extension matrix and genetic algorithm to network misuse detection. Based on extension matrix formed on positive and negative examples, we set up the integer-programming model (IPM) for optimal rule extraction and feature subset selection. Then genetic algorithm is applied to solve IPM and optimal rules are generated for intrusion detection. Those generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment.

This model learns the habits a user has when he works with the computer, and raises warnings when the current behavior is not consistent with the previously learned patterns.

Second, a lack of comprehensive labeled Synchrophasor data along with other system related information imposes challenges to the development and evaluation of data mining algorithms that can classify power system cyberpower events. In this work, a WAMS cyber-physical test bed was developed using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Commercial control and monitoring devices, hardware, software, and industry standard communication networks and protocols were combined with custom Matlab, Python, and AutoIt scripts to model realistic power system contingencies and cyber-attacks. An automated simulation and control engine was developed to randomize modeled cyber-power events including power system faults, contingencies, control actions and cyber-attacks. Scripts were added to capture heterogenous sensor data and create ground truth labeled datasets. The WAMS cyber-physical test bed is capable of simulating various sized power systems and creating datasets without altering the hardware configuration.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data. Our extensive evaluation shows that, compared with pure statistical learning models, LEAPS achieves consistently higher accuracy when detecting real-world camouflaged attacks with benign program cover-up.","1530-0889;15300889","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266838","Attack Detection;Program Analysis;Statistical Learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Libraries;Payloads;Statistical learning;Training","flow graphs;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;security of data;statistical analysis","LEAPS;attack detection system;camouflaged attack detection;cyberinfrastructures;formal program analysis;malicious system events;statistical learning methods;supervised statistical learning methods;testing data","","","","39","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention. In this way, ESIDE-Depian uses a Bayesian network to learn from both anomaly and misuse knowledge in order to be able to detect either kind of attacks, known and unknown.

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination.

The next generation of IDSs should be designed incorporating reasoning engines supported by contextual information about the network, cognitive information from the network users and situational awareness to improve their detection results. In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed. The results that we present verify that FCMs can improve the efficiency of our IDS by reducing the number of false alarms, while not affecting the number of correct detections.","","","","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497807","Basic Probability Assignment;Contextual Information;Dempster-Shafer Theory;Fuzzy Cognitive Maps;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security","Cognition;Communication networks;Data integration;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Ontologies","fuzzy set theory;probability;security of data","BPA values;FCM;IDS;attacks;basic probability assignment;contextual information;data fusion process;fuzzy cognitive maps;intrusion detection systems;situational awareness","","","","22","","","21-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed scheme to dynamically select nodes with master key shares to provide the private key generation service. The proposed scheme considers the node security and energy states in the process of selecting best nodes to construct a private key generator (PKG).

This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1499-7;1424414997","1-4244-1500-4;1424415004","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design an intrusion prevention system to realize the source-end defense method. The packets are categorized into three types: normal, suspicious and attack packets. The attack packets are blocked before they enter the Internet. The bandwidth of the suspicious packets is restricted and the IP header is attached with a signature made by their edge router. When a victim confirms the suspicious packets with an attack action, it finds out the source of the attack by the signature on the packets and then informs their edge router to block such packets.","2159-3442;21593442","978-1-4244-1271-6;9781424412716","978-1-4244-1272-3;9781424412723","10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428862","","Bandwidth;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Internet;Law;Legal factors;Lungs;Nuclear electronics;Power engineering and energy;Spine","Internet;bandwidth allocation;security of data","IP header;Internet;distributed denial of service;edge router;intrusion prevention system;network bandwidth;source-end defense;systems resources","","0","","22","","","Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It makes intrusion detection with high resource consumption, as well as results in poor performance of real-time processing and intrusion detection rate. Without loss of generality, feature selection can effectively improve the classification model performance, study on the feature selection-based intrusion detection method is therefore very necessary. This paper proposes a simple and quick inconsistency-based feature selection method. Data inconsistency is firstly employed to find the optimal features, and the sequential forward search is then utilized to facilitate the selection of subset features. The tests on KDD99 benchmark data show that the proposed feature selection method can directly eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, without degenerating the classification performance. Furthermore, due to experiments, the intrusion detection performance using the proposed method is also a little advantageous than that with the general CFS method.","","978-1-4244-9114-8;9781424491148","978-0-7695-4297-3;9780769542973","10.1109/CIS.2010.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696311","Discretization;Feature Selection;Inconsistent Rate;Intrusion Detection","","optimisation;real-time systems;security of data","data inconsistency;data selection;feature selection method;intrusion detection rate;network environments;network intrusion detection application;optimal features;real-time processing;resource consumption","","1","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true. Accordingly, we address some methods, i.e. raising timestamp precision, active self- adapting time synchronization algorithm and state turnabout mechanism.

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-5175-3;9781424451753","978-1-4244-5176-0;9781424451760","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we describe a new protocol, named SAVE, that can provide routers with the information needed for source address validation. SAVE messages propagate valid source address information from the source location to all destinations, allowing each router along the way to build an incoming table that associates each incoming interface of the router with a set of valid source address blocks. This paper presents the protocol design and evaluates its correctness and performance by simulation experiments.

Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes. To detect malicious activities, taking into consideration network lifetime, we randomly select a set of nodes that will play the role of intrusion detection monitors. The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0;9781424446780","978-0-7695-3760-3;9780769537603","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","4","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead. Therefore, we propose a utility based QoE monitoring approach based on statistical losses at the application layer.

The ubiquity of the Internet and the easy perpetration of attacks will lead to more hostile traffic. With the advent of high-speed Internet connections, organizations today find it difficult to detect intrusions. So multi sensor intrusion detection systems are inevitable. The optimum distribution of traffic to the sensors is a challenging task. We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance. We also discuss the effects of the reloading of splitting policies on packet duplication rate and on the load on the sensors.","","0-7803-8325-7;0780383257","","10.1109/INCC.2004.1366575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366575","","Adaptive systems;Educational institutions;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Scalability;Sensor systems;Statistics;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;SNORT intrusion detection system;adaptive load balancing architecture;load disparity;management console;multi sensor intrusion detection systems;packet duplication rate minimization;traffic splitting policies","","0","","8","","","11-13 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3;9781457705823","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware.

The context of such wireless medical data transport can range from home- or mobile-based healthcare to in hospital ambulatory and stationary situations. The intent of the guidance document is to be global with respect to wireless spectrum and equipment, although working group participation and expertise have favored detail of scenarios from the US. At the time of this Guidance document several applicable RF wireless technologies exist with a range of capabilities and characteristics, and in different stages of maturity, standardization, and adoption in healthcare. It is recognized that RF technologies are rapidly evolving, and new options may become available (or sufficiently established) after the publication of this Guidance document. The recommendations, therefore, avoid being overly prescriptive and instead attempt to assist medical device manufacturers, wireless equipment manufacturers, healthcare providers, government agencies and any other end-user of this document to make reasonable judgments regarding performance and practical implementation of wireless solutions. The Guidance document defines specific use cases to estimate, compare, and contrast performance of known technologies operating on wireless personal area (WPAN), wireless local area (WLAN), wireless metropolitan area (WMAN), and wireless wide area (WWAN) networks. Major considerations are 1) the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (reliability, latency, priority, bandwidth) associated with the data being transported, 2) the expected performance (power, link range, throughput, link establishment and maintenance) of the wireless technology, and 3) the specific needs and resources of the end user. Related issues include network architecture, EMI/EMC, coexistence with other data streams, security, cost, power consumpt- on, and technology configurability. Performance summaries for specific wireless technologies that support defined use cases are not intended as an endorsement of optimal solution because different needs, resources, sizes, and environments cannot be comprehensively addressed. This overview document is meant to be a foundation and reference for several follow-on IEEE 11073.3.5.x standards that will profile specific classes of off-the-shelf RF wireless technologies for medical data transport. Importantly, this guidance document is not envisioned to be periodically updated, but instead will act as a source of information for the follow-on IEEE 11073-0305.x standards that will supplant it. Periodic updates will be performed on the IEEE 11073- 0305.x standards only.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519427","","","","","","0","","","","","2008","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

In this new approach, the need of large samples by the previous approach is reduced by using Support Vector Machine while maintaining the high quality clustering of k-Medoids.

In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in Snorts ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets.

The results obtained through simulations indicate that it is possible to recognize attacks that the intrusion detection system never faced before on an acceptably high level","","0-7695-2497-4;0769524974","","10.1109/ITNG.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611629","","Computer science;Databases;Expert systems;Face recognition;Geographic Information Systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Neural networks;Petri nets","neural nets;security of data","anomaly detection based intrusion detection;neural networks","","6","","9","","","10-12 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A packet dropping attack is one of the major security threats in OppNets as neither source nodes nor destination nodes have any knowledge of when or where a packet will be dropped. In this paper, we present a novel attack and detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping where the malicious node drops one packet or more and injects a new fake packet instead. Our novel detection mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. It relies on a very simple yet powerful idea, the creation time of each packet.

Aiming at the problems existed in actual methods or models of intrusion detection, an effective method for intrusion detection based on hidden markov model and rough sets theory was presented in this paper. The circular sequences of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process is replaced by circular body, then, a little data is extracted from normal system call sequences, and is transformed to decisive table, afterward, the decisive table is reduced and the simplest rules that present normal behavior mode is extracted by rough sets theory. These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper. Compared with other methods in the literature, the method presented in this paper is not only able to extract a set of effective detection rules with the minimum size from part of records of system call sequences, but also can detect the known intrusion quickly.

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naive Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively. This sharp increase in detection rate is obtained with less than 3 percent false alarms. The signatures generated by ADS upgrade the SNORT performance by 33 percent.

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8;9781457714498","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a simple chromosome-based evaluation model for GDIS. In this model, the genotype space is a linear number sequence, and a digital pattern sequence is produced as the phenotype space using a number of mechanisms, including pattern mining and genetic algorithms. We present a range of experiment analyses to show the higher efficiency and stronger immunity of this model, improving the rate of successful prediction in intrusion detection in GDIS. The detectors generated may have higher coverage, hence would impose lower communications and computational loads on systems in which they were incorporated.","","0-7803-7804-0;0780378040","","10.1109/CEC.2003.1299827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1299827","","Artificial immune systems;Biological cells;Biology computing;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Detectors;Distributed computing;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Predictive models","computer viruses;data mining;genetic algorithms","artificial immune system;chromosome-based evaluation model;computer defense immune systems;computer virus detection;digital pattern sequence;genetic algorithms;genotype space;linear number sequence;network intrusions;pattern mining","","0","","11","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A novel architecture against false data injection attacks in smart grid","S. Bhattarai; L. Ge; W. Yu","Towson University, Towson, MD","2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","20121129","2012","","","907","911","Smart Grid is a new type of power grid that will provide reliable, secure, and efficient energy transmission and distribution. Cyber attacks against data readmission system threaten the security of smart grid. Hence, identifying and preventing the false data injection as early as possible becomes a critical issue. However, there is no existing solution that considers all aspects such as deployment cost and system efficiency. In this paper, we apply a light-weight watermarking technique to defend against false data injection attacks. To be specific, we add a secure watermark to real-time meter readings and transmit the watermarked data through high speed unsecured network. The utility can then correlate the watermarked data with the original watermark to detect the presence of false data injected by adversary. Our simulation results show that watermarking technique can effectively detect any false manipulation to the watermarked data at low cost.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364511","","Demodulation;Meter reading;Sensors;Smart grids;Watermarking","power engineering computing;power meters;power system economics;power system security;smart power grids;watermarking","architecture;cyber attack;data readmission system;deployment cost;efficient energy transmission;energy distribution;false data injection attack;false manipulation detection;high speed unsecured network;light-weight watermarking technique;power grid;real-time meter reading;reliable energy transmission;secure energy transmission;secure watermark;security;smart grid;system efficiency;watermarked data transmission","","2","","12","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
