Our goal is to provide a roadmap for researchers seeking to understand existing capabilities and to identify gaps in addressing the numerous threats and vulnerabilities present in VoIP systems. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to vulnerabilities reported in a variety of VoIP products. We identify two specific problem areas (denial of service, and service abuse) as requiring significant more attention from the research community. We also find that the overwhelming majority of the surveyed work takes a black box view of VoIP systems that avoids examining their internal structure and implementation. Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations.

Earlier default allow model was used to secure web applications but it was unable to secure web applications against plethora of attacks [1]. In contrast, more restricted security to the web applications is provided by default deny model which at first, builds a model for the particular application and then permits merely those requests that conform to that model while ignoring everything else. Besides this, a novel and effective methodology is followed that allows to analyze the validity of application requests and further results in the generation of semi structured XML cases for the web applications. Furthermore, mature and resilient XML cases are generated by employing learning techniques. This system will further be gauged by examining that XML file containing cases are in correct accordance with the XML format or not. Moreover, the distinction between malicious and non-malicious traffic is carried out carefully.

The proposed SSF algorithm uses a tiny data structure, and is light-computational and cache- resident. It can be implemented efficiently in a software-based platform. Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

Abnormal behaviors or activities on the network systems could be detected by security systems. But, conventional security systems such as anti-virus and firewall cannot be successful in many malicious actions. To overcome this problem, better and more intelligent IDS solutions are required. In this study, a hybrid approach was proposed to use to detect network attacks. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods were combined to model and detect the attacks. KNN was employed to classify the attacks and GA was used to select k neighbors of an attack sample. This hybrid system was first applied in intrusion detection field. The system provides advantages such as, decreasing dependency of full training data set and providing plausible solution for intrusion detection. The results showed that the proposed system provides better results than single system.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424302","Intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;k-nearest neighbor;network attacks","Biological cells;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Support vector machines;Training","firewalls;genetic algorithms;pattern recognition","GA;KNN methods;anti-virus;firewall;genetic algorithm;hybrid method;hybrid system;information systems;intelligent IDS solutions;intrusion detection field;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor;malicious actions;security systems","","","","33","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090605","2009","","","90","97","A main concern for network intrusion detection systems is the ability of an intruder to evade the detection by routing through a chain of intermediate stepping-stone hosts. The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates. Our experiments report a very good performance with very high detection rate and low false detection rate when using carefully selected parameter values.","","978-1-4244-3572-2;9781424435722","978-0-7695-3564-7;9780769535647","10.1109/ARES.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066459","Stepping-stone;connection chain;data mining;intrusion detection;network security","Association rules;Computer security;Cryptography;Data mining;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Timing jitter","Internet;data mining;security of data;telecommunication network routing","Internet;evasion technique;false detection rate;modified association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;network routing;stepping-stone connection detection","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through a comparative theoretical study, this paper analyzes several organizational security objectives in order to determine the network intrusion detection system that effectively meets these objectives. Through conclusive analysis of the study, heuristic based systems are better served to meet the organizational objectives than signature based systems.

These templates can either be user-defined or created from known data sets. We have developed an automated tool called RACOON, which rapidly generates large amounts of user command data from a given template. We demonstrate that our technique can produce realistic data by showing that it passes several statistical similarity tests with real data. Our approach offers significant advantages over passive data collection in terms of being nonintrusive and enabling rapid generation of site-specific data.

In our work, we compare our result with the common method of feature selection is which the Chi-Square (Chi<sup>2</sup>) feature selection. There are 4 main steps in our experiment: Firstly, we start with data pre-processing to discard unnecessary attributes. Secondly, MHGIS feature selection and Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection have been employed on the pre-processed data, to reduce the number of attributes. Thirdly, we measure the recognition performance by using supervised learning algorithms which are C4.5, BPNN, RBF and SVM. Lastly, we evaluate the results received from MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup>. From the KDDCup99 dataset, we got 13,499 randomly sampling patterns with 34 data dimensions. With the use of MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup> algorithms, we obtain 14 and 26 features respectively.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot detect new types of cyberattacks not existing in their databases. Therefore, IDS need a complementary help to provide a maximum protection to industrial systems against cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning techniques, in particular one-class classification, in order to bring the necessary and complementary help to IDS in detecting cyberattacks and intrusions. One-class classification algorithms have been used in many data mining applications, where the available samples in the training dataset refer to a unique/single class.We propose a simple one-class classification approach based on a new novelty measure, namely the truncated Mahalanobis distance in the feature space.

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance.

"Operating System Security","T. Jaeger","","Operating System Security","20140702","2008","","","","","Operating systems provide the fundamental mechanisms for securing computer processing. Since the 1960s, operating systems designers have explored how to build secure operating systems - operating systems whose mechanisms protect the system against a motivated adversary. Recently, the importance of ensuring such security has become a mainstream issue for all operating systems. In this book, we examine past research that outlines the requirements for a secure operating system and research that implements example systems that aim for such requirements. For system designs that aimed to satisfy these requirements, we see that the complexity of software systems often results in implementation challenges that we are still exploring to this day. However, if a system design does not aim for achieving the secure operating system requirements, then its security features fail to protect the system in a myriad of ways. We also study systems that have been retrofit with secure operating system fe tures after an initial deployment. In all cases, the conflict between function on one hand and security on the other leads to difficult choices and the potential for unwise compromises. From this book, we hope that systems designers and implementors will learn the requirements for operating systems that effectively enforce security and will better understand how to manage the balance between function and security.

Using the data set of UNM CERT sendmail for testing, the feasibility of typical set method is validated, and a proper rate of typical set for intrusion detection is proposed. Meanwhile, the LSM (Linux Security Modules) framework is presented to hook system calls and other audit data from operation system to build intrusion detection system signature database and identify intrusion activity.

Foreseen applications include safety applications, traffic efficiency enhancements, and infotainment services. To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","3","","31","","2012-12-21","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron.

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3;9781424417513","","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations.

We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device.

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a uncompromised router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module.

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","2164-4357;21644357","978-1-4673-5137-9;9781467351379","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the past decades, these systems were isolated and use proprietary software, operating systems, and protocols. In recent years, SCADA systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems, which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security threats. Traditional security solutions (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems) cannot fully protect SCADA systems, because they have different requirements. This paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect SCADA tailored attacks. This is based on a data-driven clustering technique of process parameters, which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system. Later, it extracts proximity-based detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values. The empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states, while facilitating the monitoring of the SCADA system.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2512522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366594","Classification;Clustering;IDS;SCADA Security","Computer science;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Water resources","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Internet vulnerability;SCADA systems;SCADA tailored attack detection;data-driven clustering technique;intrusion detection approach;operating systems;process parameters;proprietary software;protocols;proximity-based detection rules;security threats;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","","","38","","2015-12-25","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attacks themselves are long-lasting, difficult to expose and often use very advanced hacking techniques. Since they are advanced in nature, prolonged and persistent, the organizations behind them have to possess a high level of knowledge, advanced tools and competent personnel to execute them. The attacks are usually preformed in several phases - reconnaissance, preparation, execution, gaining access, information gathering and connection maintenance. In each of the phases attacks can be detected with different probabilities. There are several ways to increase the level of security of an organization in order to counter these incidents. First and foremost, it is necessary to educate users and system administrators on different attack vectors and provide them with knowledge and protection so that the attacks are unsuccessful. Second, implement strict security policies. That includes access control and restrictions (to information or network), protecting information by encrypting it and installing latest security upgrades. Finally, it is possible to use software IDS tools to detect such anomalies (e.g. Snort, OSSEC, Sguil).","","","","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160480","","Command and control systems;Data mining;Malware;Monitoring;Organizations;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;data protection","access control;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection;attack vectors;computer systems;encryption;security policies;security upgrades;software IDS tools","","1","","14","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3;9781479923533","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conventional algorithms of snorts mostly are evaluated as low-powered detection tools. In contrast, recent algorithms are able to detect intrusion properly. The major weakness in modern detection methods is that the power of IDS is restricted only to the network on which these intelligent algorithms are applied. This paper presents a new method to solve issues considering locality. We have classified any attacks to networks in the form of a protocol in the application layer which could be saved later in any and/or all of verified servers as rules. Thus all snorts across the inter-networks would be aware of the attack with enough details to immune itself. The major advantage of this method is that the old snorts strategies can also use possibilities of the new snorts dispersed over the network. We will evaluate this method and show that the resulted traffic is balanced across the Internet without imposing considerable overheads.","","978-0-7695-3930-0;9780769539300","978-1-4244-5423-5;9781424454235","10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5385146","Classification;IDS;Rule;Snort","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer network management;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Network servers;Power engineering computing;Protection;Protocols","computer network security;pattern classification","application layer protocol;attacks classification;computer network;low powered detection tool;snort intrusion detection systems","","1","","11","","","25-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a benchmark data from a KDD competition designed by DARPA (U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), we demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate classifiers can be constructed by using SVMs to detect DoS attacks.

Work on formalizing trust dates back to the mid-nineties, while work on formalizing privacy is in its infancy. The two concepts have a number of similarities including considerations of information type and sensitivity to inform actions, relationship between the communicating parties, and the context or purpose for communication. There are some key differences. Privacy, unlike trust, is legislated. In Canada, there are also a number of regulations, directives and policies that come along with the legislation. Trust, on the other hand, is the Wild West; almost anything goes. Early attempts at formalizing privacy have been largely restricted to P3P initiatives and other policy developments. Not only have they been largely ignored by the user community, but also because of the limited scope in application seem to fail to actually enable privacy protection. On the other hand, early trust models have taken a different approach. Instead, using a natural science approach and artificial agents, trust is circumscribed, simple and most importantly - repeatable. In the context of failed attempts at formalizing privacy through policy, learnings from trust can be utilized to advance the computational notion of privacy protection. This paper takes the work on formalizing privacy in a much needed new direction by examining the potential of an appropriate and applicable framework for privacy based on extant trust formalizations. It proposes a formalization for privacy can be based on trust, and would outline the types of privacy, examine privacy based decision-making, and explore the applicability of the agents as appropriate representations of people in the computational environment.","","978-1-4244-7551-3;9781424475513","978-1-4244-7549-0;9781424475490","10.1109/PST.2010.5593227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593227","privacy;trust","Computational modeling;Data privacy;Law;Legislation;Ontologies;Privacy;Social network services","security of data","privacy formalizations;trust formalizations;vampire bats","","1","","29","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

Most works focus on profile/model definition while critical issues related to anomaly measuring, aggregating and thresholding have not received similar attention. In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real <i>http</i> traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","5","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics. Simulation of these classification models has been performed using 10-fold cross validation. NSL-KDD based data set has been used for this simulation in WEKA.","","978-1-4799-9854-8;9781479998548","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225395","classification;data mining;intrusion detection;machine learning;network","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","BayesNet classifiers;IBK classifiers;J48 classifiers;JRip classifiers;NSL-KDD based data set;PART classifiers;REPTree classifiers;WEKA tool;classification techniques;data mining;data repository;logistic classifiers;machine learning algorithms;management authority;network intrusion detection;network security industry;network traffic;policy violation detection;random forest classifiers;random tree classifiers","","2","","14","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate.

Mobile agents are shown most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents or hosts.

Since APT attack vector is not previously known, consequently this can harm the organization's assets before the patch for this security flaw is released/available. This paper presents a preliminary research effort to counter the APT or zero day attacks at an early stage by detecting malwares.

This paper studies a more difficult, yet less investigated problem, called multi-set membership lookup, which involves multiple (sometimes in hundreds or even thousands) sets. The lookup determines not only whether an element is a member of the sets but also which set it belongs to. To facilitate the implementation of multi-set membership lookup in on-die memory of a network processor for line-speed packet inspection, the existing work uses the variants of Bloom filters to encode set IDs. However, through a thorough analysis of the mechanism and the performance of the prior art, much to our surprise, we find that Bloom filters--which were originally designed for encoding binary membership information--are actually not efficient for encoding set IDs. This paper takes a different solution path by separating membership encoding and set ID storage in two data structures, called index filter and set-id table, respectively. With a new ID placement strategy called uneven candidate-entry distribution and a two-level design of an index filter, we demonstrate through analysis and simulation that when compared with the best existing work, our new approach is able to achieve significant memory saving under the same lookup accuracy requirement, or achieve significantly better lookup accuracy under the same memory constraint.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2536618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431999","Computational efficiency;approximation algorithms;compression algorithms.","Arrays;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Indexes;Memory management;Random access memory","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS.

Integrating the ldquoDanger Theoryrdquo, negative selection and immune memory, the paper proposes a novel artificial immune model for intrusion detection. The paper considers the coordination of DCs in the innate immune system and T cells in the adaptive immune system. At the same time the paper focuses on how to define ldquodanger signalsrdquo and considers whether to have a danger to the protected system as the basis of defining ldquoself-nonselfrdquo, in which the self is dynamically updated. The theory analysis shows that the dynamic self can improve the problem of error detection rate increasing sharply, and the dual detection method of DCs detecting the behaviors of antigens and T cells detecting the antigens can also significantly decrease error detection rate.","","978-0-7695-3490-9;9780769534909","","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756899","","Application software;Change detection algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Conferences;Distributed control;Immune system;Industrial training;Intrusion detection;Protection","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithms;security of data","adaptive immune system;artificial immune model;danger theory;error detection rate problem;intrusion detection model","","2","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current research focuses concentrate on how to effective reduce high false alarm rate and usually ignore the fact that the poor quality data for the modeling of normal patterns as well as the high computational cost make the current anomaly detection methods not act as well as we expect. Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the data reduction mechanisms would greatly improve the performance of TCM-KNN and make it be a good candidate for anomaly detection in practice.","","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","1-4244-1304-4;1424413044","10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267564","Anomaly Detection;Data Reduction;Network Security;TCM-KNN Algorithm","Computational efficiency;Conferences;Costs;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Testing","data mining;data reduction;genetic algorithms;security of data;telecommunication security","computational cost;data mining scheme;data reduction mechanism;filter based feature selection methods;genetic algorithm;instance selection;network anomaly detection scheme","","3","","15","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to their possible deployment in remote locations for civil, educational, scientific, military purposes and security which includes intrusion detection and intrusion prevention are of utmost importance. Distributed wireless sensor networks have problems on detecting and preventing malicious nodes which always bring destructive threats and compromise multiple sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Detection system is implemented based on learning automata concept. We implemented the system in network simulator GloMoSim. Also we have rigorously evaluated the performance of our proposed solution by performing a variety of experiments and have found our solution approach to be promising.","","978-1-4673-2624-7;9781467326247","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384996","Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks;GloMoSim Simulator;Intrusion Detection;Learning Automata","Energy states;Equations;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","learning automata;protocols;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GloMoSim network simulator;WSN;authentication service;distributed wireless sensor networks;energy-aware protocol;intrusion detection protocol;intrusion prevention;learning automata;malicious node detection;malicious node prevention;message transmission;network security;packet forwarding;sensor identity;sensor node;sensor security appliance;wireless technology","","0","","28","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Secure Defensive Mechanisms: An Appropriate Categorisation","S. A. Alsuhibany; W. Albattah","Comput. Sci. Dept., Qassim Univ., Buryadh, Saudi Arabia","2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Data Intensive Systems","20160204","2015","","","33","37","A defensive mechanism, which encompasses a variety of services and protections, has been proposed by several researchers for many organizations to protect system resources from misuse. In the practical use of defensive mechanisms such as CAPTCHAs and spam filters, attackers and defenders exchange 'victories,' each celebrating (temporary) success in breaking and defending. In this paper, since most of these defensive mechanisms depend on a single algorithm as a defence mechanism, we present a confusion matrix that helps to understand how a defensive mechanism performs a correct/incorrect classification. Specifically, the expected results, of a defensive mechanism from the confusion matrix, lead to categorising defensive mechanisms into two main categories: Assertive and Predictive defensive mechanisms. Moreover, the predicted results of a predictive defensive mechanism can be divided into two types: Interactive and non-Interactive defensive mechanisms. The result of this categorization scheme is useful to interested parties such as researchers, defensive mechanism designers and developers, as a tool to classify a defensive mechanism. Also, the view of interactive defensive mechanisms (IDMs) is important and useful, since it provides a consistent and clear understanding of the problem of IDMs in a system. Having such a view enables various interested parties, such as researchers, defensive mechanism design and defensive mechanism developers, to work from the same reference point, which is as unambiguous as possible.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396478","categorization;defensive mechanism;interactive defensive mechanism;non-interactive defensive mechanisms;security","CAPTCHAs;Classification algorithms;Computers;Filtering algorithms;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Security","information filters;matrix algebra;pattern classification;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","CAPTCHA;IDM;appropriate categorisation;assertive defensive mechanism;categorization scheme;confusion matrix;defence mechanism;defensive mechanism design;defensive mechanism developer;incorrect classification;interactive defensive mechanism;predictive defensive mechanism;secure defensive mechanism;spam filter;system resource","","","","32","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in order to optimize the effectiveness of intrusion detection procedure and decrease its complexity, it is still a challenge to select an optimal attribute subset. In this context, the primary problem of attribute selection is the criterion to evaluate a given attribute subset. In this work, it is presented an evaluation of Renyi and Tsallis entropy performances compared with Shannon entropy in order to obtain an optimal attribute subset that increase the capability of the Intrusion Detection System to classify the traffic as normal or as suspicious. In the experimental results, the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate almost remains the same or even becomes better depending on the attack category (e.g. in the DoS and Probing attack) when small attribute subsets are used compared when all attributes are used.","","978-1-4577-0455-0;9781457704550","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088496","Attribute selection;Rnyi and Tsallis entropy;network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Decision trees;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring","computer network security;entropy","DoS attack;Renyi entropy;Shannon entropy;Tsallis entropy;attack category;attribute selection;detection accuracy;false alarm rate;intrusion detection procedure;intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;network traffic;optimal attribute subset;optimal attributes;probing attack","","3","","31","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
