Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution. The experimental results on KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark data demonstrate that applying ACCM with one of the feature extraction algorithms is effective to detect known or unseen intrusion attacks with high detection rate and recognize normal network traffic with low false positive rate","","0-7803-9484-4;0780394844","","10.1109/ICIT.2005.1600609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1600609","Clustering;Feature extraction;Industrial network security;Intrusion detection;Swarm intelligence","Biological system modeling;Clustering algorithms;Computer network management;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Feature extraction;Industrial control;Intrusion detection;Networked control systems;Protection","decentralised control;feature extraction;industrial control;industrial plants;multi-agent systems;optimisation;pattern clustering;safety systems","KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark;ant colony clustering approach;decentralized intrusion detection;decentralized management;industrial control systems;industrial network;industrial plants;large switched networks;multiagent intrusion detection system;network attacks;networked control systems;normal network traffic;optimization principles;prevention control;security protection;swarm intelligence;unsupervised feature extraction;unsupervised feature extraction algorithms","","14","","5","","","14-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7;9781424491537","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.","1524-4547;15244547","","","10.1109/WETICE.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927063","Indistinguability;Nonmalleability;Secure Scheduling;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Context;Generators;Scheduling;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","communication costs nodes;network lifetime;protocols;quality of service;resource constraints;resource preservation requirement;secure communication infrastructure;secure nodes scheduling algorithm;security framework;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have also developed a measure of DoS impact on network services to evaluate the severity of an attack and the effectiveness of a proposed defense. The benchmarks are integrated with the testbed via the experimenter's workbench - a collection of traffic generation tools, topology and defense library, experiment control scripts and a graphical user interface. Benchmark scenarios provide inputs to the workbench, bypassing the user's selection of topology and traffic settings, and leaving her only with the task of selecting a defense, its configuration and deployment points.

In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4;0769529224","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to understand how our community deals with this lack of labels, we perform a systematic study of network security research accepted at top IT security conferences in 2009-2013. Our analysis reveals that 70% of the papers reviewed rely on manually compiled data sets. Furthermore, only 10% of the studied papers release the data sets after compilation.

Unlike other statistical anomaly detection methods such as nearest neighbor approach, K-means clustering or probabilistic analysis that employ distance computation in the feature space to identify the outliers, our approach does not involve costly point-to-point computation in organizing the data into clusters. Another advantage is the reduced network size. We use the classification capability of the K-Map on selected dimensions of data set in detecting anomalies. Randomly selected subsets that contain both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark data are used to train the hierarchical net. We use a confidence measure to label the clusters. Then we use the test set from the same KDD Cup 1999 benchmark to test the hierarchical net. We show that a hierarchical K-Map in which each layer operates on a small subset of the feature space is superior to a single-layer K-Map operating on the whole feature space in detecting a variety of attacks in terms of detection rate as well as false positive rate.","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.843274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408059","Computer network security;neural network applications;self-organizing feature maps","Benchmark testing;Computational efficiency;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Computer vision;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Nearest neighbor searches;Organizing","probability;security of data;self-organising feature maps","computer network security;hierarchical Kohonenen Net;intrusion detection system;multilevel hierarchical K-Map;neural network application;probabilistic analysis;self-organizing feature maps","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Computer Simulation;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","57","3","27","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3;9781424469383","978-1-4244-6939-0;9781424469390","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event. We evaluate various machine learning methods as disturbance discriminators and discuss the practical implications for deploying machine learning systems as an enhancement to existing power system architectures.","","","","10.1109/ISRCS.2014.6900095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900095","SCADA;Smart grid;cyber-attack;machine learning","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Protocols;Relays;Smart grids","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system faults;security of data","cyber-attack discrimination;machine learning;power system architectures;power system disturbance;power system operators","","3","","37","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Statistical techniques, evolutionary techniques, and data mining techniques have also been used for this purpose. In this paper, we use a centroid-based technique for network intrusion detection in which the centroid is constructed on the basis of diversity. Diversity of a point is the sum of the distances from a point to all other points in a cluster. The point having minimum diversity is chosen as a centroid. The performance of diversity-based centroid shows significant improvement in the classification of intrusions.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4244-7114-0;9781424471140","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2136-3;0769521363","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","16","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062096","","Aggregates;Condition monitoring;Error analysis;Internet;Power generation economics;Probability;Recruitment;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis;Unsolicited electronic mail","IP networks;Internet;electronic messaging;probability;security of data;statistical testing;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;IP addresses;Internet;SPOT;U.S. campus network;compromised machines;identity theft;outgoing messages monitoring;security attacks;security threats;sequential probability ratio test;spam zombie detection system;spam zombies detection;spamming activity;statistical tool","","0","3","13","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting faults and attacks is essential to ensure the correct semantic of the network, while distinguishing faults from attacks is necessary to initiate a correct recovery action. The approach uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the error/attack-free dynamics of the environment and the dynamics of error/attack data.

It can offer targeted forensic evidence collection and investigation of computer network attacks. Such unique capabilities are instrumental to network intrusion detection that is challenged by large volumes of data and complex network topologies. This paper presents an innovative approach that coordinates distributed network traffic Monitors and attack Correlators supported by Open Virtual Switches (OVS). The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms. We experiment with this SDN-supported collaborative approach to detect TCP SYN flood attacks on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), a realistic virtual testbed. The response times and detection accuracy, in the context of a small to medium corporate network, have demonstrated its effectiveness and scalability.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357519","Denial of Service;Intrusion Detection;SDN;Threat Containment","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Correlators;Monitoring;Software","computer network security;software defined networking","DDoS containment;TCP SYN flood attack;anomaly detection;attack correlators;attack signature recognition;collaborative DDoS flooding detection;computer network attack;deep packet inspection;distributed network traffic monitors;forensic evidence collection;network flooding attack signature;network intrusion detection;open virtual switch;software defined networking","","","","13","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks.

Most prevalent among them are spoof threats, in which one network device changes its network identifiers to that of another network device. One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients. This paper discusses some of the non cryptographic techniques to detect MAC spoofing along with their pros and cons and the network scenarios in which they can be used. Analysis of these techniques is done on data captured from live test bed. The information in this paper can help the wireless equipment manufacturers to implement intrusion detection systems capable of detecting MAC address spoofing efficiently with least number of false alarms.","1531-2216;15312216","978-1-4244-3805-1;9781424438051","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772621","","Access control;Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Power system protection;Radio frequency;Testing;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","access protocols;wireless LAN","MAC spoof detection;access control;denial of service attacks;full scale authentication;intrusion detection systems;network identifiers;non-cryptographic methods;per-frame source authentication;power saving frames;security threats;wireless LAN;wireless network","","3","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each application has demands on the connectivity infrastructure such as availability, reliability, and data payload capability. Furthermore, wireless medical device applications may share RF spectrum resources with a host of other non medical device applications. Although hospitals traditionally segregate data network traffic and patient care data network traffic, the increased costs for a hospital to utilize two separate network infrastructures has led some to consider whether or not wireless medical devices should be integrated onto IT-type 802.11 wireless networks. While there are arguable advantages to incorporating all devices onto a single network infrastructure, there are increased potential patient safety risks that must be addressed. In order to address the increased risks of incorporating wireless medical devices on hospital's 802.11 wireless networks, thorough evaluation and testing is essential.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","RSSI;mobile robots;optimisation;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio transceivers;radionavigation","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;centralized coordinated motion algorithm;distributed protocol;gradient vectors;heuristic approach;mobile robots;optimized trajectory;particle filters;position estimation;rapid wireless tracking verification;received signal strength measurements;suboptimal approach","","1","","28","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved require/provide model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map.

Characterizing the service times of network IDSs is a crucial step in improving their real time performance. We analyzed about 41 million packets organized in five data sets of 10 minutes each collected at the entry point of a large production network and processed by Snort, a commonly used IDS. The processing times of the three main stages in Snort were measured. The main conclusions of our study were: (1) rule checking accounts for about 75% of the total processing time in IDSs, with mean pay load checking time being 4.5 times larger than mean header checking time. (2) The distribution of rule checking limes is markedly bimodal, a direct consequence of the bimodality in packet composition in current high speed Internet traffic. (3) Header processing times have a small variance and small correlation coefficients. (4) In contrast, the distribution of payload processing times displays high variance, in a form that can be generally characterized as slightly heavy-tailed. Explicitly, payload processing times have a lognormal upper tail, clipped at the top 1%. This extreme 1% upper tail is better fit by an exponential distribution. (5) Additionally, payload processing times were shown to be highly correlated, with correlation coefficients several orders of magnitude higher than the confidence bands for the standard whiteness test. The impact of these findings in the design of IDSs for real time operation in networks is discussed, and compared with existing results for processing times for Unix processes, which were shown to display pronounced heavy-tailed characteristics.","0191-2216;01912216","0-7803-8682-5;0780386825","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428609","","Data security;Displays;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Production;Statistical distributions","Internet;exponential distribution;information systems;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;Snort;Unix processes;exponential distribution;lognormal upper tail;network intrusion detection system;payload processing times;security violations;statistical distribution","","17","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics.

Consequently, there are growing rate of computer attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents a model to investigate these problems.

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis.

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations. In addition, the anomaly detection algorithm achieved a 99.9% recognition rate. All output from the modules were correctly distributed using the common communication structure.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2013.2270373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547755","Autonomic computing;control systems;industrial ecosystems;network security;service-oriented architecture","","access protocols;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;field buses;fuzzy logic;industrial control;intelligent sensors;meta data;network interfaces;pattern clustering","C++;IF-MAP;PERL;SOAP-based interface;anomaly detection algorithm;autonomic computing;autonomic intelligent cyber-sensor;digital device proliferation;flexible two-level communication layer;fuzzy logic;industrial control network awareness;internal D-Bus communication mechanism;legacy software;metadata access point external communication layer;mixed-use test network;network security sensor;networked industrial ecosystem;proof of concept prototype;self-managed framework;service oriented architecture;simple object access protocol-based interface;traffic monitor;virtual network hosts","","4","1","29","","2013-06-26","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks. I will construct the secured VOIP communication over MANET area using TCP / IP and storage Data in GSM modem as SMS (inbox). Finally using IP and MAC get fail to prevent spoofing attack then DoS attack prevent using BIOS serial number of clients.","","978-1-4673-5037-2;9781467350372","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528595","Cryptography;GSM modem;JDK 1.6;Oracle;Security;VOIP;Wireless ad hoc network","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet telephony;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile handsets;Servers","Internet telephony;access protocols;authorisation;cellular radio;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;modems;transport protocols","BIOS serial number;DoS attack;IP header;IP-spoofed attacks;Internet;MAC address;MAC-spoofed attacks;MANET area;SMS;TCP-IP protocol;VOIP communication security;data storage;defense communication;register database;source IP address authentication;wireless GSM modem","","0","","23","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the artificial intelligent techniques, traditional supervised learning techniques are not appropriate for an auto-mated network management and specially to detect temporal changes in network intrusion patterns and characteristics. The reason is that supervised learning needs the manager. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters. Our system labels the map produced by SOM using correlations between features for an auto-mated network management. We experiments our system with KDD Cup 1999 data set.

To overcome this matter, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used as a vital instrument in defending the network from this malicious activity. With the ability to analyze network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going network attack, majority of network administrator has turn to IDS to help them in detecting anomalies in network traffic. The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure. This paper describes IDS that detects fast attack intrusion using time based detection method. The time based detection method calculates the statistic of the frequency event which occurs between one second time intervals for each connection made to a host thus providing the crucial information in detecting fast attack.","","978-1-4244-8048-7;9781424480487","978-0-7695-4177-8;9780769541778","10.1109/NETAPPS.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635816","","Conferences;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Predictive models;Protocols","Internet;computer network security;security of data","Internet;fast attack activity;frequency event statistics;malicious activity;network intrusion detection system;time based intrusion detection","","0","","26","","","22-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8;9781467302418","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","2","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SEPA is an initiative of the European banking industry aiming at making all electronic payments across the Euro area -- e.g. by credit card, debit card, bank transfer or direct debit -- as easy as domestic payments currently are. One of the payment schemes defined by the SEPA mandate is the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) that allows a creditor (biller) to collect funds from a debtor's (payer's) account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller. Thanks to SDD consumers can make and receive no-cash euro payments with a single set of instructions and a single bank account. It is apparent that the use of this standard scheme facilitates the access to new markets by enterprises and public administrations and allows for a substantial cost reduction. However, the other side of the coin is represented by the security issues concerning this type of electronic payments. A study conducted by Center of Economics and Business Research (CEBR) of Britain, on behalf of Liverpool Insurance Company, showed that from 2006 to 2010 the Direct Debit frauds have increased of 288%. In this paper a comprehensive analysis of real SDD data provided by the EU FP7 LeanBigData project is performed in order to identify and classify emerging and sophisticated attack patterns that can be executed against an SDD service. The results of this data analysis will be used to inspire the design of a security system supporting analysts to detect Direct Debit frauds.","","978-1-4673-8317-2;9781467383172","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2015.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424655","","Companies;Europe;ISO Standards;Security;XML","banking;data analysis;security of data","EU FP7 Lean BigData project;European banking industry;SEPA direct debit;direct debit transactions;electronic payments;retail payments;security system;transactions payments","","","","28","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we find how the optimal decision depends on the state variables and model parameters that characterize the IDS's detection rate and the attacker's persistence.","","978-1-4244-5870-7;9781424458707","","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394923","","Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection","Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;invasive software","Markov decision process;attacker detection;attacker expelling;information system;intrusion detection system;malware","","0","","12","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines a large set of security incident data using tools from the software reliability community. We look at applying Non-Homogenous Poisson Process (NHPP) models as a method for describing the reliability growth process. We examine the full set of incidents as well as subsets of the data based on incident types. We look at using the Laplace test to guide selection of the appropriate models. Then, based on the trend results, we apply various NHPP models (i.e., Goel-Okumutu, S-Shaped, Duane, and K-Stage Curve) to illustrate the relevance of using these models to fit the incident data and to predict future incidents.","1071-9458;10719458","978-0-7695-3024-6;9780769530246","","10.1109/ISSRE.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4402207","","Computer network reliability;Computer security;Context modeling;Data security;Helium;Information security;Predictive models;Reliability engineering;Software reliability;Testing","security of data;software reliability","computer security incidents;consumer confidence;data theft;network security incidents;nonhomogenous Poisson process;reliability growth process;reputational damage;software reliability;stock prices","","4","","15","","","5-9 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the burgeoning literature, accurate detection of malware remains an elusive and challenging endeavor due to the increasing usage of payload encryption and sophisticated obfuscation methods. Also, the large variety of malware classes coupled with their rapid proliferation and polymorphic capabilities and imperfections of real-world data (noise, missing values, etc) continue to hinder the use of more sophisticated detection algorithms. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to detect known and newly emerging malware at a high precision using layer 3 and layer 4 network traffic features. The framework leverages the accuracy of supervised classification in detecting known classes with the adaptability of unsupervised learning in detecting new classes. It also introduces a tree-based feature transformation to overcome issues due to imperfections of the data and to construct more informative features for the malware detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using real network data from a large Internet service provider.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-5944-3;9781467359443","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567003","","Feature extraction;Kernel;Malware;Payloads;Support vector machines;Training;Unsupervised learning","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);tree data structures","Internet service provider;Internet today;layer 3 network traffic features;layer 4 network traffic features;obfuscation methods;payload encryption;polymorphic capabilities;security threats;supervised learning;tree-based feature transformation;unsupervised learning;zero-day malware detection","","5","","13","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The genetic-fuzzy clustering algorithm not only plays fully global optimization ability of genetic algorithm and local optimization capacity of FCM algorithm but also balances effectively algorithm to clustering space exploration.

Therefore, we need strong mechanism to detect these malevolent nodes and to classify normal and abnormal nodes as per the behavior of nodes. Machine learning techniques distinguish outlier nodes quickly and accurately provide classification by observing behavior of those nodes in the network. In this paper, we study various machine learning techniques as artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, Q-learning, Bayesian network for identifying the malicious nodes. These techniques are able to detect black hole, gray hole, flooding attacks and other packet dropping attacks. These types of misbehaving nodes are identified and future behaviors of the nodes are predicted with supervised, un-supervised, reinforcement machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/SPACES.2015.7058308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058308","Mobile ad hoc network;black hole;gray hol;machine learning techniques;packet dropping attacks;support vector machine (SVM)","Bayes methods;Genetic algorithms;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Support vector machines","belief networks;computer network security;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","Bayesian network;Q-learning;artificial neural network;black hole detection;decision tree;flooding attack detection;gray hole detection;malevolent node detection;malicious node detection;mobile ad hoc network classification;packet dropping attack node detection;reinforcement machine learning technique;supervised learning;support vector machine;unsupervised learning","","0","","38","","","2-3 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the <i>iLOC</i> attack, the attacker launches low-rate port-scan traffic, encoded with a selected <i>pseudo-noise</i> <i>code</i> (PN- code), to targeted networks. While the secret PN-code is invisible to others, the attacker can accurately determine the existence of monitors in the targeted networks based on whether the PN-code is embedded in the report data queried from the data center of the ITM system. We conduct extensive simulations on the <i>iLOC</i> attack using real-world traces.

Current anomaly IDSs are inefficient for real-time detection because of their complex computation. This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce the heavy computational cost of an anomaly IDS. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain. The final decision will be made according to a pre-calculated threshold to differentiate normal and abnormal network packets. The proposed approach is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4244-8863-6;9781424488636","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2010.5700198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5700198","Euclidean distance;feature selection;linear discriminant analysis;network intrusion detection;packet payload","","computational complexity;security of data;statistical analysis","Euclidean distance;anomaly intrusion detection system;complex computation;linear discriminant analysis;payload feature selection;real-time detection","","2","","26","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
