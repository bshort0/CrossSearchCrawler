Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","3","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malware also utilizes it as a covert channel through which to evade the firewall (FW) or network intrusion detection system (NIDS). We recognize a malware, which employs HTTP to communicate as the HTTP-like Botnet. Some parts of the network traffic of an HTTP-like Botnet are different from normal HTTP applications. Based on the differences between HTTP-like Botnet traffic and normal HTTP applications, we developed an Automatic NIDS Rule Generating System (ARGS). The ARGS is a proof of concept (POC), which generates the corresponding NIDS rules efficiently and precisely from the input malign traffic (MT). ARGS is an incremental method to generate and optimize the rules. It can generate rules quickly and precisely without first requiring the collection of many malware samples for clustering. For practical purposes, we adopt Snort as our IDS engine in ARGS. In our experiments, the time required by ARGS to process MTs and generate corresponding rules is significantly shorter than existing solution when the rule-optimization is not required. Besides, the generated rule set can detect more 30% malware traffic compared to SourceFire IDS full-set and thus can efficiently stop the spreading of malware in time.","","978-1-5090-0187-3;9781509001873","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2015.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415791","","Browsers;Engines;Malware;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Support vector machines","Internet;firewalls;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;transport protocols","ARGS;HTTP-like malware communication;IDS engine;Internet;POC;Snort;automatic NIDS rule generating system;botnet traffic;clustering;firewall;main protocol;network intrusion detection system;proof of concept;rule-optimization","","","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we try to build an efficient defense system based on a cooperative scheme to detect intrusions in AODV-based ad hoc networks using clustering technique and Back Propagation Network (BPN). A clustering architecture provides network scalability and fault tolerance, and results in more efficient use of network resources. Back-propagation neural networks is used for the purpose of anomaly detection and the feature is selected from the packets.

Then, we assess the impact of putting operational but possibly infected nodes into quarantine. Finally, we study the implications of scanning nodes for early detection of malware (e.g., worms), accounting for false positives and false negatives.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.30.75s and a duration time of 0.150.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs. In order to illustrate our ideas, we built user profiles of 41 users working on Microsoft Word and applied two algorithms, viz., IPAM and Nave Bayes to distinguish between them. When supplied with appropriately interpreted command sequences of a DMS, IPAM was able to distinguish between users effectively, while Nave Bayes failed to produce any meaningful results.

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6;9780769540566","978-1-4244-7143-0;9781424471430","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.","","","","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849283","","Conferences;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Probes","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information theory;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;coordination pattern;cyber attack;cyber threat intelligence;cyberspace;data mining methods;early cyber attack notification;early cyber attack warning;emergency response teams;fuzzy approaches;information theoretical metrics;large-scale orchestrated probing events;malicious activities;malicious real darknet data;malware traffic;network security analysts;orchestration pattern;routable unallocated IP addresses;signal techniques;statistical techniques","","2","","15","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These sensors may operate on widely different electrical phenomenologies to provide their guided means of detection and communication of the detected events. This paper provides a survey of these different sensor detection methods, and unlike past or companion papers, which focus on a specific detection technology, looks at the application from the cable viewpoint outward. This review is believed to be of interest to both sensor users and developers as it cuts across the array of sensor technologies from a different physical viewpoint. This review starts from no conductor optical cables, progresses through single conductors, and moves on to multi conductor cables. The primary focus is on dual conductor, metallic sensor cables, since they are the most prevalent. The different principles of detection, and their application to security sensors is addressed.

The behavior of the system is defined in terms of a behavior set rather than using a single parameter. This facilitates greater accuracy in describing the behavior of the system and helps in reducing false-positives.

In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose. In the fourth part a DNIDS has to be deployed on a range of ISPs in order to monitor and clean the traffic of the users belonging to the central group. We applied the new framework by deriving the social network of 1000 students, finding the most influential group of users, and analyzing the influence of the deployment of DNIDS using a simulation tool.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2;9781467348652","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4577-2027-7;9781457720277","978-1-4577-2026-0;9781457720260","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","2","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The learning architecture is composed from a hierarchy of self-organizing feature maps. Such a scheme is entirely unsupervised, thus the quality of the intrusion detection system is directly influenced by the quality of the dataset. Dataset biases are investigated through three different dataset partitions: 10% KDD (default training dataset); normal connections alone; 50/50 mix of attack and normal.

We focus on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this dendrogram structure under SLHC is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described.

One of the main attributes that characterize SDN is the significant role of software to manage and control the architecture. There are four major concerns for such software dominant role, security, performance, reliability, and fault tolerance. Among them security is considered a major concern. SDNs security concerns include attacks on the control plane layer such as DoS attacks. This paper presents an inference-relation context based technique for the detection of DoS attacks on SDNs. The proposed technique utilizes contextual similarity with existing attack patterns to identify DoS in an OpenFlow infrastructure.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267;21682267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","3","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures.

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as good or bad depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM learns the structure of the good and bad SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also real SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","1","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized.

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5;0769524575","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X;1930529X","1-4244-0356-1;1424403561","1-4244-0357-X;142440357X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","1","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first propose an extension of an IDS based on information flow control. We address issues concerning programs execution and improve its expressiveness in terms of security policy. This extended model can be configured to reach a wide variety of different security goals. Particularly, it allows for information flow checking based on users and/or programs dependent policy rules. Furthermore, suspicious modification of binary programs can be detected to avoid malware execution.

The error injection experiments show that about 2% of errors injected into the firewall code segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations.

In this paper, we present an approach for detecting worms based on similar patterns of connection activity. We then investigate how to improve the computational efficiency of worm detection by presenting a greedy algorithm, which minimizes the amount of traffic processing needed to detect worms, thus increasing the scalability of the system. Our evaluation shows that the greedy algorithm not only achieved high detection accuracy and reduced the amount of processing time to detect worms, but also achieved reasonable worm traffic detection in the early stages of an outbreak.","1573-0077;15730077","0-7803-9087-3;0780390873","","10.1109/INM.2005.1440779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440779","","Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Greedy algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;greedy algorithms;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet worm;anomaly detection;greedy algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security;worm traffic detection","","3","","18","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data.

These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","2373-0854;23730854","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

Since essential data dependencies reflect semantic relationships among data items and are less likely to change than SQL query structures or database user behaviors, they are ideal for profiling data correlations for identifying malicious database activities.","1062-922X;1062922X","978-1-4244-6586-6;9781424465866","","10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5641988","Data Mining;Database Security;Intrusion Detection","Databases","SQL;data mining;relational databases;security of data","database intrusion detection;database user activities;log mining approach;malicious database transactions;multidimensional data dependency;multilevel data dependency;profile SQL query structures","","2","","21","","","10-13 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The developing process and status of e-commerce are stated, which makes the rapid developing e-commerce face new challenges. The demand for network security, mechanisms, business needs, risk and technical measures are analyzed in detail. On the basis of chaotic theory, how the chaotic control of encryption for e-commerce is studied and a comprehensive chaotic encryption algorithm is provided. The algorithm can be used to encrypt and decrypt to the transmission of data effectively. Moreover, a discrete chaotic system is simulated and the results show the confidentiality of the encryption method well.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606093","E-commerce;chaotic encryption;parameter modulation;security","Chaos;Costs;Cryptography;Data security;Electronic commerce;Globalization;Hardware;Information security;Internet;Manufacturing","chaos;cryptography;electronic commerce;socio-economic effects","business;chaotic control;chaotic encryption;decryption method;discrete chaotic system;e-commerce security;economics;network security;parameter modulation","","1","","7","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
