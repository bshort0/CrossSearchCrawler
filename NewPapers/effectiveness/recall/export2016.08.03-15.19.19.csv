The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","978-0-7695-3473-2;9780769534732","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","evasive attack;intrusion detection;protocol mimicry;protocol structure;state transition","Inspection;Intrusion detection;MIMICs;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","security of data","IDS-IPS;MimicHunter framework;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;firewall;information theft events;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network based intrusion;network security audit;network security devices;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient.

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs.

One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called conditional data sharing, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","2166-0077;21660077","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The distribution of vulnerable hosts on the Internet, however, is highly non-uniform over the IP-address space. This implies that random scanning wastes many scans on invulnerable addresses, and more virulent scanning schemes may take advantage of the non-uniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution. Questions then arise how attackers may make use of such information, and how virulent the resulting worm may be. These issues provide worst-case scenarios for defenders and best-case scenarios for attackers if the vulnerable-host distribution is available. This work develops such a scenario as the so-called importance scanning. Importance scanning results from importance sampling in statistics that scans IP-address space according to an empirical distribution of vulnerable hosts. An analytical model is developed to relate the infection rate of worms with the importance-scanning strategies. Experimental results based on parameters chosen from code red and slammer worms show that an importance-scanning worm can spread much faster than both a random-scanning worm and a routing worm. Furthermore, a game-theory approach suggests that the best strategy for defenders is to scatter applications uniformly in the entire IP-address space.","1930-529X;1930529X","0-7803-9414-3;0780394143","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577955","","Analytical models;Application software;Computer worms;Internet;Monte Carlo methods;Probability;Routing;Scattering;Space technology;Statistical distributions","IP networks;Internet;game theory;importance sampling;invasive software;telecommunication security","IP-address space;Internet worms;code red;game-theory approach;importance sampling;importance-scanning worm;random-scanning worm;routing worm;scanning schemes;slammer worms;vulnerable hosts;vulnerable-host distribution","","8","1","19","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, recent countermeasures are focusing on after intrusion such as an incident response. We previously proposed a system in order to support network administrators performing incident responses. However, our previous system uses only anomaly detection technique to detect signs of cyber attacks so that we may overlook some signs. In addition, we bother with a lot of unimportant detection reports including many false positives. Our previous system deals with detected malware one by one. Such behavior cannot cope with various situations of incidents. As a solution, this paper proposes an incident response support system based on seriousness of infection. The system combines various types of detection techniques and raises the large number of detection report. To manage detection reports, we define Infection Suspicious Level (ISL) that represents degree of suspicious about malware infection. By assigning ISL to all network segments, the system performs appropriate monitoring, analysis, and takes countermeasure semi-automatically based on ISL. The proposed system can raise a number of detection reports, reduce the false positive problem, and provide several strategies against attack.","","","","10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427090","","Access control;Electronic mail;IP networks;Malware;Monitoring;Servers","invasive software","ISL;anomaly detection technique;cyberattacks;incident response support system;infection seriousness;infection suspicious level;intrusion prevention;malware detection","","","","12","","","13-15 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5;9781424462315","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems. We have collected real user behavior data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct these feature vectors. These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors. We have tested our technique with various feature vector parameters and conclude that these feature vectors can provide unique and comprehensive user behavior information and are powerful enough to detect masqueraders","","1-4244-0130-5;1424401305","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652076","","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","GUI based systems;computer system illegitimate activity;graphical user interface;impersonation attack;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;support vector machine;user identification","","6","","34","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter.

Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is shown by calculating the throughput of the network and number of channel switches with respect to varying number of secondary and malicious nodes and by comparing it to an earlier proposed TCP protocol.","","978-1-4799-2293-2;9781479922932","","10.1109/FIT.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717217","cognitive radio networks;cross layer design;security;transport layer protocol","Adaptation models;Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Protocols;Throughput;Training;Wireless networks","access protocols;cognitive radio;computer network security;hidden Markov models;transport protocols;wireless channels","MAC layer;TCP protocol;channel switches;cognitive radio network;cross-layered approach;hidden Markov model;malicious node;open medium access;security threat;transport layer protocol;wireless channel;wireless network","","0","","23","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A substantial portion of commercial Intrusion Detection Systems operates only with detection techniques based on rules for the recognition of pre-established behavioral patterns (called signatures) that can be used to identify these types of attacks. However, the characteristics of these attacks are adaptable, compromising thus the efficiency of IDS mechanisms. Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Hidden Markov Model based on Viterbi algorithm to detect distributed denial of service attacks in data communication networks. Two main contributions of this work can be described: the ability to identify anomalous behavior patterns in the data traffic with the Viterbi algorithm, as well as, to obtain feasible levels of accuracy in the detection of distributed denial of service attacks.","","","","10.1109/LCN.2015.7366308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366308","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protocols;Viterbi algorithm","Viterbi detection;computer network security;data communication;hidden Markov models","DDoS attack detection;IDS mechanism;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous behavior pattern identification;attack identification;computational resource;data communication network;data traffic;distributed denial of service attack;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system;signature recognition","","","","22","","","26-29 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2517321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383218","Smart city;attack detection;chance discovery;software-defined networking;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Access control;Base stations;Hierarchical systems;Sensors;Smart cities;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;smart cities;software defined networking;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks","UCON technology;WSN hierarchical security framework;advanced persistent threat detection;chance discovery technology;dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism;high-level attacks;isolated defense component;low-level attack detection;network function virtualization;resource consumption;resource-restrained wireless sensor network;smart cities;smart services;software defined networking;sophisticated attacks;unknown attack detection;usage control technology","","","","35","","2016-01-14","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950;08858950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","6","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address the above issue, a two-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Depending on the definition of relevant feature and redundant feature and using mutual information as criterion, it firstly eliminates the irrelevant features and then eliminates the redundant features. With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold. Experiments over networks connection records from authoritative data set KDD CUP 1999 were implemented for several detection algorithms to evaluate the proposed method.

Often called intrusion location capability, this capability also presents inherent features such as; more accuracy in camera pre-set positioning, temporary disabling of sub-zone and individual sensitivity level per sub-zone. However, even though the market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact on the overall system cost. The paper shows how synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length. In other word, for a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is subdivided in to up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters.

This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","1550-3607;15503607","1-4244-0353-7;1424403537","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection.

The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable. MicroTrack complies with radio regulatory requirements for low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors in the HF band.","","0-7803-7436-3;0780374363","","10.1109/CCST.2002.1049250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049250","","Acoustic pulses;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Coaxial cables;Hafnium;Leak detection;Microwave sensors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ultra wideband radar","CW radar;access control;coaxial cables;fast Fourier transforms;radar applications;radar signal processing;sensors","FM CW radar techniques;Intrepid MicroTrack leaky coaxial cable sensor;barrier mounted applications;buried applications;digital processing components;fast Fourier transform;high speed high resolution analog to digital converters;intruder detection;intruder location;low cost direct digital synthesis chips;low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors;precise target location;radio regulatory requirements;surface applications;swept frequency response translation;ultra wide band HF terrain following radar","","4","2","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC.

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data.

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

To deal with this issue, we propose CREPUSCOLO, a collusion resistant and privacy preserving location verification system. In CREPUSCOLO, we use location-proofs collected from co-located mobile devices, which can be endorsed by a token acquired from a trusted Token Provider. In fact, location-proofs endorsed by tokens provide the resiliency against collusion attacks, because this combination can prove that a certain mobile device was at a certain location at a specific time. CREPUSCOLO also protects the source location privacy by enforcing the usage of periodically changing pseudonyms. Extensive simulations show that CREPUSCOLO is effective in detecting collusion attacks even under very conservative hypothesis. For instance, with just 11 Token Providers spread over a 121 km<sup>2</sup> area characterized by a very low density of cooperating devices, 90% of collusion attacks are detected.","2151-4763;21514763","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766357","","Authorization;Geology;Jamming;Protocols","authorisation;data privacy;formal verification;mobile computing","CREPUSCOLO;collusion attacks;collusion resistant privacy preserving location verification system;location based access control;location based social networks;location sensitive applications;mobile device;source location privacy;trusted token provider;unauthorized access","","0","1","15","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new intrusion detection method by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is proposed. PNN divides inputs into two groups, normal and abnormal. Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time.

We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic).

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental.

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","5","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This passive line sensor detects disturbances to commercial FM radio signals caused by an intruder moving in proximity to an open transmission line relative to the same radio signal received on a central reference antenna. The product utilizes a totally new type open transmission line and associated signal processing technique so as to determine the location of the intruder along the sensor line and to permit the use of exactly the same cable structure along the entire cable length. This new open transmission line was designed to be used buried beneath a surface, laying on a surface or suspended in air. By simultaneously processing signals from two or more FM stations the RadioGuard product provides redundancy in case of station failure as well as improved performance due to frequency diversity. The general principles of synergistic radar, the design of the open transmission line, and the specific signal processing techniques used in RadioGuard are described.

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","1","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Only relevant information about destination IP addresses and destination ports are stored in two steps in a two-dimensional Bloom filter. This algorithm can be indefinitely performed on a real traffic stream thanks to a new adaptive refreshing scheme that closely follows traffic variations. It is a scalable algorithm able to deal with IP traffic at a very high bit rate thanks to the use of hashing functions over a sliding window. Moreover it does not need any a priori knowledge about traffic characteristics. When tested against real IP traffic, the proposed on-line algorithm performs well in the sense that it detects all the port scan attacks within a very short response time of only 10 seconds without any false positive.","2151-4763;21514763","978-1-4673-3087-9;9781467330879","978-1-4673-3088-6;9781467330886","10.1109/CRISIS.2012.6378945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378945","Attack detection;Bloom filter;Internet measurements;On-line algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Context;IP networks;Internet;Manganese;Radiation detectors","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data structures;telecommunication traffic","IP traffic;Internet measurements;destination IP addresses;destination ports;hashing functions;online vertical port scan detection algorithm;port scan attack detection;sliding window;two-dimensional Bloom filter","","0","","14","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While designing intrusion detection systems, these uncertainties should be taken into consideration. Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process. For verifying the detection accuracy of our classifier, User to Root and Remote to Local attacks of DARPA KDD99 Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set were used. We compared the results of our proposed approach with those of k-NN classifier, fuzzy k-NN classifier and evidence-theoretic k-NN classifier.

One major reason why traffic trace owners hesitate to make the traces publicly available is the concern that confidential and private information may be inferred from the trace. We focus on the problem of anonymizing IP addresses in a trace. More specifically, we are interested in prefix-preserving anonymization in which the prefix relationship among IP addresses is preserved in the anonymized trace, making such a trace usable in situations where prefix relationships are important. The goal of our work is two fold. First, we develop a cryptography-based, prefix-preserving anonymization technique that is provably as secure as the existing well-known TCPdpriv scheme, and unlike TCPdpriv, provides consistent prefix-preservation in large scale distributed setting. Second, we evaluate the security properties inherent in all prefix-preserving IP address anonymization schemes (including TCPdpriv). Through the analysis of Internet backbone traffic traces, we investigate the effect of some types of attacks on the security of any prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm. We also derive results for the optimum manner in which an attack should proceed, which provides a bound on the effectiveness of attacks in general.","1092-1648;10921648","0-7695-1856-7;0769518567","","10.1109/ICNP.2002.1181415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181415","","Binary trees;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Decision making;Stress","Internet;cryptography;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP addresses;Internet backbone traffic traces;Internet research;TCPdpriv scheme;confidential information;cryptography;measurement-based security evaluation;optimisation;prefix-preserving IP address anonymity;prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm;private information;real-world traffic traces;security attacks;security properties","","18","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Empirical results using a KDDCUPpsila99 dataset had an intrusion detection accuracy of 99.9834%, which made it useful for intrusion detection and data re-determination.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-2095-7;9781424420957","978-1-4244-2096-4;9781424420964","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621096","Bayesian Theory;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafers Theory;Intrusion detection system;Support Vector Machine","Computer science;Cybernetics;Data engineering;Data security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Set theory;Uncertainty","genetic algorithms;principal component analysis;regression analysis;rough set theory;security of data;sensor fusion","KDDCUPpsila99 data;PCA;discriminant analysis;feature selection methods;genetic analysis;intrusion detection;multiple logistic regression;principal component analysis;rough set theory;two-dimensional data fusion model","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response, defenders have deployed cyber sensors in order to gain visibility into both network and host activities. However, the data generated by these sensors must be correlated to identify individual attacks. This is currently a highly manual process. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association. Our approach is to extend the multiple hypothesis tracking framework, from the standard kinematic domain, to the cyber domain. Combining the multiple hypothesis tracking framework with cyber association analytics will allow the formation of more accurate cyber attack tracks, reducing the computational burden currently residing on the human.","","978-1-4577-0267-9;9781457702679","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977647","Attack Correlation;Cyber Tracking;Multiple Hypothesis Tracking","Correlation;IP networks;Kinematics;Radar tracking;Sensors;Target tracking;Weight measurement","security of data;sensor fusion","cyber association analytics;cyber attack tracks;multiple hypothesis tracking","","1","","12","","","5-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
