In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior. Simulation results provide evidence the effectiveness for achieving detection of exhaustion attacks with improved detection rate.","2164-7143;21647143","978-1-4673-5117-1;9781467351171","","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416593","DDoS;Detection;Exhaustion attacks;FLS;IEEE 802.15.4;MAC Layer;Security","Batteries;Fuzzy logic;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Security;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;computer network security;fuzzy logic;personal area networks","DDoS;IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer;LR-WPAN;communication capabilities;computation capabilities;detection mechanism;distributed denial of service;exhaustion attack detection;fuzzy logic system;low rate wireless personal area network;malicious attacks;security system;sensor power;sensory resources;untrusted environments","","0","","29","","","27-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modeling normal system/network behaviors enables anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) to be extremely effective methodology to detect both known as well as unknown/new attacks. However, current software-based methods are difficult to process a large amount of data in anomaly-based IDSs and cannot keep up the high-link speeds. The implementations of anomaly-based IDSs on parallel processing platforms are considered as necessary to accelerate speed of the systems. Neural Networks are a good example of parallel computing. In this paper, we used Neural Network technology to classify normal or abnormal behaviors. The parallel nature of Neural Networks has been implemented on GPUs that allows the system to meet a set of requirements such as time constraints management, robustness, high processing speed and re-configurability. Experiments with KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections which have been preprocessed with methods of features selection and normalization have shown that our work is effective to accelerate intrusion detection in anomaly-based IDS. The result shows that our implementation on GPU is much faster than the implementation on CPU up to 32x.","","","","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422376","Anomaly-based IDS;GPU;Neural Network","Acceleration;Artificial neural networks;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Training","graphics processing units;neural nets;parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","GPU;KDD Cup 1999 network traffic connections;anomaly-based IDS acceleration;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;feature selection;intrusion detection system;neural network;normal system/network behavior modelling;parallel processing platform;software-based method","","","","22","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack. The proposed method was tested on an experimental smart grid system demonstrating enhanced cyber-security.","","978-1-4673-0161-9;9781467301619","978-1-4673-0162-6;9781467301626","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309292","Anomaly Detection;Critical Systems;Cyber Sensor;Domain Knowledge;Fuzzy Logic System;Smart Grid","Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Frequency selective surfaces;Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Sensitivity;Telecommunication traffic","fuzzy logic;security of data;smart power grids","IT2 FLS;anomaly detection algorithms;anomaly detection solution;cyber-security measures;false negatives rates;false positive rates;interval type-2 fuzzy logic system;linguistic domain knowledge;normal network behavior models;novel anomaly detection architecture;planned large scale deployment;smart grid network devices;smart grid systems","","2","","25","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3;9781479938353","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, neural networks, support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees are three significant and popular schemes borrowed from the machine learning community into intrusion detection in recent academic research. However, these machine learning schemes are rarely employed in large-scale practical settings. In this paper, we implement and compare machine learning schemes of neural networks, SVM and decision trees in a uniform environment with the purpose of exploring the practice and issues of using these approaches in detecting abnormal behaviors. With the analysis of experimental results, we claim that the real performance of machine learning algorithms depends heavily on practical context.

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157;07303157","978-0-7695-3726-9;9780769537269","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","1","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, constructing and maintaining a misuse intrusion detection system for a network is labor  intensive, since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized. Moreover, the rules corresponding to the scenarios and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded. In such situations, data mining can be used to ease this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. From this work, it is observed that significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","978-1-4244-1924-1;9781424419241","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447164","","Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data security;Heuristic algorithms;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Training data","","","","2","","11","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mutual information based feature selection algorithm can handle linearly and nonlinearly dependent data features. Its effectiveness is evaluated in the cases of network intrusion detection. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), named Least Square Support Vector Machine based IDS (LSSVM-IDS), is built using the features selected by our proposed feature selection algorithm. The performance of LSSVM-IDS is evaluated using three intrusion detection evaluation datasets, namely KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ dataset.

Butler","","Applications of Zero-Suppressed Decision Diagrams","20141217","2014","","","","","A zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZDD) is a data structure to represent objects that typically contain many zeros. Applications include combinatorial problems, such as graphs, circuits, faults, and data mining. This book consists of four chapters on the applications of ZDDs. The first chapter by Alan Mishchenko introduces the ZDD. It compares ZDDs to BDDs, showing why a more compact representation is usually achieved in a ZDD. The focus is on sets of subsets and on sum-of-products (SOP) expressions. Methods to generate all the prime implicants (PIs), and to generate irredundant SOPs are shown. A list of papers on the applications of ZDDs is also presented. In the appendix, ZDD procedures in the CUDD package are described. The second chapter by Tsutomu Sasao shows methods to generate PIs and irredundant SOPs using a divide and conquer method. This chapter helps the reader to understand the methods presented in the first chapter. The third chapter by Shin-Ichi Minato introduces the f ontier-based method that efficiently enumerates certain subsets of a graph. The final chapter by Shinobu Nagayama shows a method to match strings of characters. This is important in routers, for example, where one must match the address information of an internet packet to the proprer output port. It shows that ZDDs are more compact than BDDs in solving this important problem. Each chapter contains exercises, and the appendix contains their solutions.

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems.

We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments.

Misuse detection systems use signature databases to detect known attacks. However, it is difficult to keep the database up to date with the rate of discovery of vulnerabilities. They also cannot detect zero-day attacks. By contrast, anomaly detection systems learn the normal behavior of the system and monitor its activity to detect any deviations from the normal. Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications.

In this paper, we propose a unique security scheme Distributed Intrusion Detection System using Mobile Agents in Cloud Computing (DIDMACC) to detect the distributed intrusions in cloud. We have used mobile agents to carry intrusion alerts from consumer virtual machines to the management server where correlation takes place. Our system can detect the intrusions on virtual machines, identify the vulnerable ports, and can correlate malicious events to detect distributed intrusions in a cloud based network. Mobile agents are also used to update the signature database at virtual machines being monitored. Mobile agents, being lightweight and flexible software programs, reduce the network load by carrying intrusion-related data and code. DIDMACC provides a scalable and robust intrusion detection system which is a key requirement for cloud networks. We have validated the security of our system using Ptybull 2.0. The results show that use of mobile agents and correlation has improved the detection of DoS attacks.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089;10897089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1;9781424475261","978-0-7695-4107-5;9780769541075","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same.

However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2169-X;076952169X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","10","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models.

To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

This algorithm clusters large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical values effectively. The intrusion detection system based on this algorithm can deal with massive unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and anomaly and even can detect unknown attacks.

A Hidden Markov Model is proposed for sensing intrusions in a distributed environment and to make a one step ahead prediction against possible serious intrusions. DIPS is activated based on the predicted threat level and risk assessment of the protected assets. Intrusions attempts are blocked based on (1) a serious attack that has already occurred (2) rate of packet flow (3) prediction of possible serious intrusions and (4) online risk assessment of the assets possibly available to the intruder. The focus of this paper is on the distributed monitoring of intrusion attempts, the one step ahead prediction of such attempts and online risk assessment using fuzzy inference systems. Preliminary experiment results indicate that the proposed framework is efficient for real time distributed intrusion monitoring and prevention.","","0-7695-2876-7;0769528767","978-0-7695-2876-2;9780769528762","10.1109/IAS.2007.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299772","","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","Markov processes;fuzzy set theory;risk management;security of data","advanced network monitoring;distributed intrusion prediction;distributed intrusion prevention system;fuzzy inference systems;hidden Markov models;large network;online fuzzy risk assessment;packet flow rate","","9","","9","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries.

Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks.

To overcome the vulnerabilities of network security researchers have come up with different frameworks of intrusion detection system using data mining. Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier.

Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data.

In particular, the set packing algorithm is used to optimize the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a trust node aware optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing in the communications of the nodes.

During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage.

"Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data","S. Pan; T. Morris; U.

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To improve the detection of attacks, sharing data among distributed nodes or terminals and collaborating on a decision is key. This paper presents a distributed and collaborative intrusion detection (DaCID) system that relies on Dempster Shafer theory of evidence for fusing data from multiple nodes. In this approach the detection is done collaboratively and the decision is distributed among all nodes. DaCID is more robust than other systems since it is completely distributed and the decision is made autonomously at each node.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization.

Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood. This paper describes an agent-based framework designed to manage a set of visual analytic components in order to improve a security analyst's understanding and ability to classify the threats to the network that they govern. In the proof-of-concept system an agent selects the most effective method for event aggregation, given a particular set of events which have been generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

The main disadvantages of current IDSs are a high false detection rate and the lack of post-intrusion decision support capability. To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine.

In practice, flows usually suffer from passive statistical detection and active desynchronized attacks such as chaff packets and flow splitting etc. So invisibility and robustness are the two important required characters. In this paper, an invisible timing flow watermarking method is proposed based on centroid matching of interval group. It exploits the centroid of inter-packet delays (IPDs) and utilizes the secret key to modify flow's timing information. it is verified to achieve good undetectability for typical detection tools, e.g., Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and multiple flow attack (MFA) tests.

The majority of the research focuses on developing algorithms or signatures for detecting polymorphic and metamorphic payloads. However much of this problem has already been solved through the mainstream use of host based protection mechanisms e.g. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Randomization (ASLR). Many hackers are now using the more inventive attack methods e.g., return-to-libc, which do not inject shell code onto the stack and thus evade DEP and common shell code detection mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to propose a series of generic signatures that could be used to detect network born return-to-libc attacks.

It builds on an existing method of application intrusion detection developed at the University of New Mexico that uses a system call sequence as a signature. Intrusions are detected by comparing the signature of the intrusion and that of the normal application. But when the system call sequences generated by the intrusion and the normal application are sufficiently similar, this method cannot work. By extending system call signature to incorporate temporal information related to the application, we form a richer signature. Analysis shows that the temporal behavior for many applications is relatively stable. We exclude high variance data when creating a normal database to characterize an application with a temporal signature. It can then be the basis for future comparisons in an intrusion detection system. This paper discusses experiments that test the effectiveness of the temporal signature on different applications, alternative intrusions, and in various environments. The results show that by choosing appropriate analysis methods and experimentally adjusting the parameters, intrusions are readily detected.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303;07421303","978-1-4673-1565-4;9781467315654","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, our approach uses a computationally low-cost solution to define the area of interest for tracking of multiple, moving objects.

Hyperellipsoidal clusters toward maximum intracluster similarity and minimum intercluster similarity are generated from training data sets. The novelty of the technique lies in the fact that the parameters needed to construct higher order data models in general multivariate Gaussian functions are incrementally derived from the data sets using accretive processes. The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network. One significant advantage of this is its ability to detect individual anomaly types that are hard to detect with other anomaly-detection schemes.

The training connections are first categorized on the basis of protocol and service features. This categorization is named as alpha profiling. It increases the scalability and reduces the time complexity of IDS. Large feature set of network traffic dataset is reduced using ensemble of three feature selection techniques. Beta profiling is used to reduce the size of training dataset. Various parameters like accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate, false negative rate, precision, F1-score and detection time is used to evaluate the performance.

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches. The experimental results show that our hybrid model is promising in detection compared to the previously reported results.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011237","Feature selection;Floating search;Intrusion detection;Least square support vector machines;Mutual information","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Redundancy;Support vector machines;Training","feature selection;filtering theory;least squares approximations;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;LSSVM;feature selection approach;filter selection process;intrusion detection data classification;least square support vector machine;wrapper selection process","","0","","30","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a layered reference model for database firewalls by enhancing the capability of COAST Laboratorys model. It separates a database firewall into three layers (network layer, schematic layer and semantic layer) according to the knowledge, computation target, and the control granularity of each layer.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%.

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate. In fact, our system can recognize attacks in a constant time.","","978-1-4799-3022-7;9781479930227","","10.1109/IACS.2014.6841978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841978","Host sweep;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network probe attack;Port scan;TDNN neural network","IP networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification","HIDS;NIDS;TDNN neural network structure;alert module;attack behavior classification;computer security systems;host sweep attacks;host-based intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection system;network probe attacks;packet capture engine;pattern classification;pattern recognition;port scan attacks;preprocessor;reconnaissance attacks;unauthorized accesses","","2","","26","","","1-3 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game for secure control of cyber-physical systems","F. Miao; Q. Zhu","Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA 19014","53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","20150212","2014","","","517","522","Security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a challenge for increasingly integrated systems today. To analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms for CPSs requires new system frameworks. In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","0191-2216;01912216","978-1-4799-7746-8;9781479977468","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A hybrid artificial immune system for IDS based on SVM and belief function","S. Singh; J. P. Singh; G.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security system that monitors computer systems and network traffic, analyze that traffic to identify possible security breaches and raise alerts. An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator. In this paper an hybrid model has been proposed in which intrusion detection takes place with the help Dendritic Cell Algorithm and Dempester belief theory along with SVM classification algorithms. It made the Intrusion Detection System much more efficient and accurate as compared to the existing System. It also seems to be an improvement in precise value of proper alarm generation to enhance the performance of the system.","","978-1-4799-3925-1;9781479939251","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726835","DCA;Dempster-belif theory;IDS;SVM","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Filtering;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines","Internet;artificial immune systems;authorisation;belief networks;inference mechanisms;pattern classification;support vector machines","Dempster belief theory;IDS;Internet;SVM classification algorithms;alarm generation;belief function;communication network;computer system monitoring;dendritic cell algorithm;hybrid artificial immune system;information system;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;network traffic monitoring;security breaches;security system;unauthorized access","","0","","13","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Using KPCA feature selection and fusion for intrusion detection","R. Zhang; G.

A method of feature selection by Kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) and fusion is proposed. The basic features, contend features and traffic features are extracted respectively by KPCA. Then we use two levels of fusion (feature fusion and decision fusion) technique to improve the performance of intrusion detection system. However, simple combining features will not work as well as expected. For this reason, a new feature fusion method, IS feature fusion is presented. Experiments have been done on dataset in KDD-99 and simulation results show that our method by KPCA feature selection is an effective and IS feature fusion outperforms other fusion techniques.","2157-9555;21579555","978-1-4244-5958-2;9781424459582","","10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582891","Kernel Principal Component Analysis;decision fusion;feature fusion;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Testing;Training","feature extraction;principal component analysis;security of data;sensor fusion","decision fusion;detection accuracy;feature extraction;feature fusion;feature selection;intrusion detection;kernel principle component analysis;noisy features;redundant features;traffic features","","0","","13","","","10-12 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
