"Network Intrusion Detection with Cascading Classification","S. Marcek; M. Drozda","Fac. of Electr. Eng. & Inf.

The success rate of contest participants was evaluated in terms of the obtained classification cost. The classification cost of the contest winner was 0.2331, the best approach prior to our work carries the classification cost of 0.2224. We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662;21660662","978-1-4799-3857-5;9781479938575","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","19","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present experiments on three weeks of syslogs from Sandia's 512-node Spirit Linux cluster, showing one algorithm that localizes 50% of faults with 75% precision, corresponding to an excellent false positive rate of 0.05%.

These trends clearly illustrate the need for better understanding of malicious cyber activities based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster. Therefore, they seem to be clear methods of choice.","1071-9458;10719458","978-1-4673-4638-2;9781467346382","","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405356","Web 2.0 security;attacks;empirical study;multiclass classification;vulnerability scans","Accuracy;Blogs;Electronic publishing;Information services;Internet;Learning systems;Support vector machines","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Internet;J48;PART;SVM;Web 2.0 applications;attack classes;high-interaction honeypot;malicious behavior classification;malicious cyber activities;multiclass machine learning methods;multiclass malicious Web activities classification;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;supervised machine learning methods;support vector machines;three-tier Web system","","4","","34","","","27-30 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since many current Intrusion Detection Systems are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to them are expensive and slow.

Audit data taken from MAC level/network level/application level from the traces in Glomosim and are preprocessed separately for each layer's detection subsystem. Feature data sets for each layer are selected from normal transactions. The detection subsystem contains normal profiles obtained from the feature vectors of training data sets. In our work, we used Bayesian classification algorithm, Markov chain construction algorithm and association rule mining algorithm for anomaly detection in MAC layer, routing layer and application layer respectively for effective intrusion detection. Test data obtained from the network traffic is feed in to the detection subsystems. If there is any deviation from normal behavior, it is considered as abnormal or anomaly based on predefined thresholds. Intrusion results from detection subsystems of all the three layers are integrated at local integration module and the final result is sent to the global integration module.

There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator.

Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002;15506002","978-1-4244-8078-4;9781424480784","978-0-7695-4131-0;9780769541310","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset. Our experiments shows that usage of such reduced dataset in BPNN can lead to better model in terms of dataset size, complexity, processing time and generalization ability.","2327-0632;23270632","978-1-4799-8487-9;9781479984879","","10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079087","Back Propagation Neural Network;Feature Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;N Fold Validation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Power capacitors;Testing;Training","backpropagation;data handling;generalisation (artificial intelligence);neural nets","BPNN;Fscore values;IG;KDD CUP 1999 data set;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;MIT Lincon lab;anomaly detection;back propagation neural network classifier;complexity;computer network;dataset size;domain expert;feature reduction techniques;generalization ability;generalization capacity;information gain;machine learning algorithm;n-fold validation;reduced dataset","","0","","25","","","21-22 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

What is more, the model could also be updated by the C4.5 rules mined from the dataset after the event (intrusion). We employ data from the third international knowledge discovery and data mining tools competition (KDDcup '99) to train and test feasibility of our proposed model. From our experimental results with different network data, our model achieves more than 85 percent detection rate on average, and less than 19.7 percent false alarm rate for five typical types of attacks.

Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model.

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419;10834419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","15","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself.

The IDS is detecting based looking for specific signature of known threats as it antivirus and firewall. The anomaly detection is used to comparing traffics against the baseline. The detection is described briefly in this paper using fuzzy and genetic algorithm.","","978-1-4799-1796-9;9781479917969","","10.1109/CSNT.2015.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279991","Classification rules;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithm","Biological cells;Computers;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics","firewalls;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms;telecommunication traffic","IDS;antivirus;firewall;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;host based intrusion detection system;network based intrusion detection system;suspicious traffic detection;traffic monitoring","","","","11","","","4-6 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are the last line of defense against malicious hackers and help detect ongoing attacks as well as mitigate their damage. However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2169-X;076952169X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","10","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored.

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527;10639527","978-0-7695-3447-3;9780769534473","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensors have become an excellent tool for military applications involving intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, information gathering and smart logistics support in an unknown deployed area. Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model.

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","","","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","evasive attack;intrusion detection;protocol mimicry;protocol structure;state transition","Inspection;Intrusion detection;MIMICs;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","security of data","IDS-IPS;MimicHunter framework;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;firewall;information theft events;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network based intrusion;network security audit;network security devices;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework","","","","31","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for mining alerts of NIDS output report log for automatically predicting the severity of attack revealed by those alerts using data mining classification techniques. Our framework automatically detects the attack severity using the type of the suspicious traffic detected by NIDS as a feature. Hence it can save the time spent to manually analyze the log file of NIDS in order to categorize various types of captured suspicious traffic in view of the detected severity of attack. Moreover, it can help the network security administrator to create policy rules that take immediate action against the detected network attack based on its predicted severity. The experimental results show that our approach can correctly predict the severity of attack for more than 99.2% of alerts samples included in log output report of the deployed NIDS.","","","","10.1109/ISIAS.2015.7492742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492742","data mining;log file alerts;network intrusion detection","Cleaning;Communication networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training","","","","","","29","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some others may act malicious by launching security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users.

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done.

The extension of SN P system called trapezoidal Fuzzy Reasoning Spiking Neural P (tFRSN P) system is adopted in the network intrusion prediction model. SN P system is a neural-like computing model inspired from the way spiking neurons communicate using spikes. It has a graphical modeling advantage which makes it well suited for fuzzy reasoning as well as fuzzy knowledge representation. In order to evaluate the performance of tFRSN P system in intrusion detection, the publicly available KDD Cup benchmark dataset was employed.

Also, the large variety of malware classes coupled with their rapid proliferation and polymorphic capabilities and imperfections of real-world data (noise, missing values, etc) continue to hinder the use of more sophisticated detection algorithms. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to detect known and newly emerging malware at a high precision using layer 3 and layer 4 network traffic features. The framework leverages the accuracy of supervised classification in detecting known classes with the adaptability of unsupervised learning in detecting new classes. It also introduces a tree-based feature transformation to overcome issues due to imperfections of the data and to construct more informative features for the malware detection task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using real network data from a large Internet service provider.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4673-5944-3;9781467359443","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567003","","Feature extraction;Kernel;Malware;Payloads;Support vector machines;Training;Unsupervised learning","Internet;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);tree data structures","Internet service provider;Internet today;layer 3 network traffic features;layer 4 network traffic features;obfuscation methods;payload encryption;polymorphic capabilities;security threats;supervised learning;tree-based feature transformation;unsupervised learning;zero-day malware detection","","5","","13","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

The obfuscation was performed by tunneling the malicious traffic in HTTP and HTTPS protocols with the intention of simulating the usual legitimate characteristics of the HTTP traffic's flow. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

APT is a highly interactive, specifically targeted and extremely harmful network-centric attack, which employs various technologies to evade detection during attacks leading to the result that victims will not be aware of attacks until they suffer from tremendous losses. Since command and control (C&C) is an essential component during the lifetime of APT, the detection of it is a practical measure to defend against the APT. In this paper, we analyze the features of C&C in APT and find that the HTTP-based C&C is widely used. Based on the analysis results, we propose a new feature of C&C, i.e., independent access, to characterize the difference between C&C communications and normal HTTP requests. Applying the independent access feature into DNS records, we implement a novel C&C detection method and validate it on public dataset.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics.

In the practical use of defensive mechanisms such as CAPTCHAs and spam filters, attackers and defenders exchange 'victories,' each celebrating (temporary) success in breaking and defending. In this paper, since most of these defensive mechanisms depend on a single algorithm as a defence mechanism, we present a confusion matrix that helps to understand how a defensive mechanism performs a correct/incorrect classification. Specifically, the expected results, of a defensive mechanism from the confusion matrix, lead to categorising defensive mechanisms into two main categories: Assertive and Predictive defensive mechanisms. Moreover, the predicted results of a predictive defensive mechanism can be divided into two types: Interactive and non-Interactive defensive mechanisms. The result of this categorization scheme is useful to interested parties such as researchers, defensive mechanism designers and developers, as a tool to classify a defensive mechanism. Also, the view of interactive defensive mechanisms (IDMs) is important and useful, since it provides a consistent and clear understanding of the problem of IDMs in a system. Having such a view enables various interested parties, such as researchers, defensive mechanism design and defensive mechanism developers, to work from the same reference point, which is as unambiguous as possible.","","","","10.1109/DSDIS.2015.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396478","categorization;defensive mechanism;interactive defensive mechanism;non-interactive defensive mechanisms;security","CAPTCHAs;Classification algorithms;Computers;Filtering algorithms;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Security","information filters;matrix algebra;pattern classification;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","CAPTCHA;IDM;appropriate categorisation;assertive defensive mechanism;categorization scheme;confusion matrix;defence mechanism;defensive mechanism design;defensive mechanism developer;incorrect classification;interactive defensive mechanism;predictive defensive mechanism;secure defensive mechanism;spam filter;system resource","","","","32","","","11-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naive Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naive Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7;9781467313667","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must port over a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain.

Although encryption helps to increase network security level, it is not sufficient to protect against malicious intruders. An intrusion detection scheme is proposed in this paper based on cross layer feature collection from the medium access control (MAC) and network layers. The proposed method employs an hierarchical configuration that avoids using a clustering algorithm and, instead, sequentially activates the promiscuity (ability to sniff all packets transmitted by nodes within radio range) of the node based on its location in the network. The node in this case acts as a pseudo cluster head (PCH) that collects data from its neighboring nodes in each quadrant in the field and then uses this information to calculate an anomaly index (AI) in each quadrant. The mechanism uses a C4.5 decision tree to learn the network behavior under blackhole attack and is able to recognize blackhole attacks with up to 97% accuracy. The presented approach is twofold - it is energy efficient and has a high degree of intrusion detection with low overhead.","","978-1-4673-8450-6;9781467384506","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2015.7430139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430139","","Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","access protocols;cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","C4.5 decision tree;MANET;anomaly index;blackhole attack;clustering algorithm;cross layer intrusion detection;hierarchical configuration;intrusion detection scheme;medium access control;mobile ad hoc network;network security level;pseudocluster head;pseudoclustering scheme;wireless network","","","","15","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel What-if module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed What-if module.","","978-1-4673-7398-2;9781467373982","","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443439","Intrusion Detection;SCADA;SCADA Security","Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;SCADA systems;Sensors","Internet;SCADA systems;electricity supply industry;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security","Internet connectivity;SCADA security;SCADA systems;communication protection layer;data authentication layer;electric grids;electric utility;field devices;impending failure prediction;integrated triple layer module;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;triple layer intrusion detection system;what-if module based layer","","","","10","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier.

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This includes the challenges in designing intelligent engineering systems to reduce false positives and increases detection capability of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The high percentage of alerts and false positives generated by IDSs are among the significant problems. We present intelligent systems architecture and integration, including risk management and validation for reduction of false positives and infrastructure protection using a novel approach using adaptive responses from firewall packet filters in what we call, network quarantine channels (NQC). This includes risk assessments and design of integrated virtual private networks (VPNs) and strategic controls via packet filters, which collaborate with the NQC to reply to suspicious hosts, and them deny access to sensitive data servers in the infrastructure. The firewall packet filters provide effective intelligent responses by to granting access to the normal packets and denying malicious traffic access to the network, after the identity of the connections are verified through the statistical analysis in the NQC. These effective strategies reduce false positives and increases detection capability of the IDS. The intelligent systems at the system-of-systems level include systems modeling and simulation, systems engineering education, training, quality management for intrusion detection, computer security and disaster response. The validation includes statistical analysis and modeling of systems integration for handling large-scale and complex systems in emerging commercial networks. This includes large-scale systems integration various applications for technology transfer between academia and industry, and applicable to communications systems, medical systems, management and sustainability.

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on traditional graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data.

However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type opportunistic adversaries. This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats.

This algorithm enables a scalable incremental learning of patterns from data with both numeric and nominal variables. Two different methods of combining numeric and nominal variables in calculating the distance between clusters are investigated. In one method, separate distance measures are calculated for numeric and nominal variables, respectively, and are then combined into an overall distance measure. In another method, nominal variables are converted into numeric variables, and then a distance measure is calculated using all variables. We analyze the computational complexity, and thus, the scalability, of the algorithm, and test its performance on a number of data sets from various application domains. The prediction accuracy and reliability of the algorithm are analyzed, tested, and compared with those of several other data mining algorithms.","1083-4427;10834427","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2005.853501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597409","Classification;clustering;computer intrusion detection;dissimilarity measures","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Partitioning algorithms;Scalability;Testing","computational complexity;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","computational complexity;data classification algorithm;data mining algorithm;data pattern learning;mixed variables;nominal variables conversion;numeric variables;scalable incremental learning;separate distance measures;supervised clustering algorithm","","14","","19","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems are an effective way to detect malicious connections in a computer network. To get there, they classifies the connections as normal or abnormal, using different algorithms. In this paper three methods are used, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the two-stage algorithm PCA+LDA as related works, and the Direct Linear Discriminant analysis (D-LDA) algorithm as a proposed method. The PCA step in the PCA+LDA algorithm eliminates the problem of singularity but the PCA criterion is not compatible with the LDA criterion and thus may discard the important discriminative information, unlike the D-LDA algorithm which keeps them and gets rid of the singularity problem. In this work, we propose its implementation for intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in terms of detection accuracy rate which is 97.75%.","","","","10.1109/ICoCS.2015.7483227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483227","Intrusion detection system;KDDCup99;direct linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Euclidean distance;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis","computer network security;principal component analysis","D-LDA algorithm;IT security;bank data;computer network;cyber attacks;direct LDA;direct linear discriminant analysis algorithm;governmental data;malicious connection detection;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;singularity problem;two-stage algorithm PCA-LDA","","","","9","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, applying these techniques for CDSS is most likely would face a lack of criteria for adequate use. Therefore, a range of recent studies have focused on evaluating different machine learning classifiers with the aim of identifying the most appropriate classifier to be used for particular decision making problem-domain. The majority of these studies have used a single dataset within a certain medical-related classification domain. Nevertheless, evaluating machine-learning classifiers with one sample of data appears to be unsatisfying, perhaps it is not reflecting the classifiers capabilities or their behavioral patterns under different circumstances. In this study, five well-known supervised machine-learning classifiers were examined using five different real-world datasets with a range of attributes. The main aim was to illustrate not only the impact of the datasets volume and attributes on the evaluation, but also and more importantly, present the classifiers capabilities and shortcomings under certain conditions, which potentially provide a guidance or instructions to help health analysts and researchers to determine the most suitable classifier to address a particular medical-related decision making problem.","2157-8672;21578672","978-1-4673-8352-3;9781467383523","","10.1109/IWSSIP.2015.7314218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314218","classification accuracy;clinical decision support system;evaluation;machine learning;sensitivity;time complexity","Accuracy;Diseases;Liver;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","decision support systems;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","CDSS;behavioral pattern;behavioural pattern;clinical decision support system;decision making problem-domain;health analyst;health care system;machine learning classifier;machine-learning technique;medical application;medical-related classification domain;medical-related decision making;real-world dataset;supervised machine-learning classifier","","","","21","","","10-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT). The proposed CPDT combines Correlation feature selection for selecting features and Partial Decision Tree (PART) for classifying the normal and the abnormal packets.

Reliable detection of network intrusions is an important problem, misclassification of an intrusion is an issue in and of itself reducing overall accuracy of detection. A variety of potential methods exist to develop an improved system to perform classification more accurately. Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly. In particular, classification using the ensemble algorithm, StackingC, with F-Measure performance and derived Information Gain Ratio, as well as their subsequent correlation as a combined measure, is presented.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F-Measure performance;StackingC;data retrieval;ensemble algorithm;ensemble learning;feature pairings;feature selection;information gain ratio;information retrieval;misclassification;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;reliable detection","","","","20","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset.

A large number of devices connected over the Internet leads to an increase in vulnerabilities and security threats, which makes the identification of critical assets necessary. Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly. However, the Random Forest algorithm is computationally intensive and may not work for large datasets. Naive Bayes algorithm yielded the worst performance and KNearest Neighbor's performance was very close to that achieved by Support Vector Machines.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination. The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-99) dataset is used as a benchmark to compare this method with other existing techniques.

Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem with such proposed solutions is that they are usually processing intensive due to the large size of the training set in place. We propose a technique that combines a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network with the well-known Kappa coefficient to perform feature selection. By adding the Kappa coefficient to the feature selection process, we managed to reduce the training set substantially.

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features.

Then this paper classifies various modern intrusion detection system (IDS) techniques for securing smart grid network. In our approach, we propose a novel behavior-based IDS for IEC 61850 protocol using both statistical analysis of traditional network features and specification-based metrics. Finally, we present the attack scenarios and detection methods applicable for IEC 61850-based digital substation in Korean environment.","","","","10.1109/PTC.2015.7232339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232339","Cyber-physical system;IEC 61850;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;smart grid","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Inductors;Measurement;Security","IEC standards;SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids;statistical analysis;substation protection","CPS security;IEC 61850 protocol;Korean environment;SCADA system protection;behavior-based IDS;behavior-based intrusion detection technique;cyber physical system security;digital substation;electricity infrastructure physical environment;fully automated electricity network reliability;smart grid infrastructure;statistical analysis","","0","","13","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect the valuable data of their clients, organizations implement security systems to detect and prevent security breaches. But since the intruders are using sophisticated techniques to penetrate the systems, even the highly reputed secured systems have become vulnerable now. To deal with the current scenario, advanced level of researches are required to be carried out to invent more sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Among various methodologies, researchers consider Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a very effective and popular tool for developing an IDS. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient BPNN architecture for the development of an anomaly based IDS with high accuracy and detection rate. The KDD'99 data set is used in this context to develop the architecture.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065641","Anomaly detection;Artificial neural network;BPNN;Intrusion Detection System;KDD '99 data set;Network security","Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;neural nets","BPNN architecture;anomaly based IDS;anomaly based intrusion detection system;back propagation neural network architecture;client data;robust supervised learning neural network;security breach detection;security breach prevention;security system;security vulnerability;valuable data protection","","0","","25","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high. In conclusion, the paper highlights opportunities for an integrated solution to large-scale CIIDS.","1098-7584;10987584","978-1-4244-6919-2;9781424469192","","10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584418","","Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Correlation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols","security of data","collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system;computer attacks;false positives;fuzzy alert correlation;fuzzy logic","","2","","25","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems rely on monitoring and detection of intrusions, thus composing an additional line of defense. Several paradigms have been applied for implementing IDS. In this paper we propose a NIDS model based on Information Gain for feature selection and Support Vector Machines(SVM) for the detection component. SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence. We test our approach with the NSL-KDD data set and show that our model can obtain better results than regular SVM or PSO-SVM.","","","","10.1109/ICSTCC.2014.6982526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982526","Intrusion Detection;SVM and Bat Algorithm","Accuracy;Barium;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Support vector machines","feature selection;feedforward neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","Bat algorithm;NIDS model;NSL-KDD data;PSO-SVM;feature selection;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection systems;optimization;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","27","","","17-19 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
