Often much of this state resides solely in the volatile processor memory accessible to a single user-level process on a single machine. In this work, we highlight the power of independent state, i.e., internal fine-grained state that can be propagated from one instance of a NIDS to others running either concurrently or subsequently. Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging. We have experimented with each of these applications in several large environments and are now working to integrate them into the sites' operational monitoring.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are the major concern for security in the collaborative networks. Although non DDOS attacks are also make the network performances poor, the effect of DDOS attacks is severe. In DDOS attacks, flooding of the particular node as victim and jam it with massive traffic happens and the complete network performance is affected. In this paper, a novel Intrusion Detection and Prevention System is designed which detects the flooding DDOS attacks based on Firecol and prevents the attacks based on Dynamic Growing Self Organizing Tree (DGSOT) for collaborative networks.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","5","","41","","2012-03-21","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","1542-1201;15421201","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","23","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","1","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0;9781424465330","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","6","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of an organization's sensitive and proprietary data resides in a Database Management System (DBMS). Data security is a major issue in any web-based application and database repository. Although there are various model implemented in the network for the security of these databases. Real world web databases have information that needs to be securely stored and accessed. In this paper we discussed proposed work classification based approach to create database policy dynamically and using these policy find intrusion in user request and response the request accordingly. The focus of our work is to develop advanced security solutions for protecting the data residing in a DBMS. Our approach is to develop an Intrusion Detection and Response (IDR) system. We introduce a policy-driven intrusion response mechanism that is capable of issuing an appropriate response based on the details of the anomalous request and discuss the implementation details on the same and report experimental results that show that our techniques are feasible and efficient.","","978-1-4799-3063-0;9781479930630","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056934","Alarms;Anomalies;IDRS;IDS;classification;countermeasure;security policies","Databases;Security","data protection;database management systems;pattern classification;security of data","DBMS;IDR system;advanced security solutions;classification;data protection;database policy;intrusion detection and response system;policy-driven intrusion response mechanism;respond anomaly requests","","0","","9","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smart phone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.","","978-1-4673-2067-2;9781467320672","","10.1109/SERE.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258304","energy model;power usage measurements;smart handheld devices","Brightness;Discharges (electric);Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Power demand;Power measurement","","","","17","","20","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In developing a successful SVM classifier, eliminating noise and extracting feature are very important. This paper proposes the application of kernel PCA to SVM for feature extraction. Then PSO Algorithm is adopted to optimization of these parameters in SVM. The novel time series analysis model integrates the advantage of wavelet, PSO, KPCA and SVM. Compared with other predictors, this model has greater generality ability and higher accuracy.","","978-0-7695-3497-8;9780769534978","","10.1109/IITA.2008.457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4739733","KPCA;PSO;SVM;Time Series;WT","Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Predictive models;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Time series analysis","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;signal classification;signal denoising;support vector machines;time series;wavelet transforms","SVM classifier;feature extraction;kernel principal component analysis;machine learning;noise elimination;optimization;pattern recognition;support vector machines;time series prediction model;wavelet","","0","","14","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
