This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting misrouted, corrupted or dropped. In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the detection manager to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1;0780381041","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Towards a unified approach to the representation of, and reasoning with, probabilistic risk information about software and its system interface","M. S.

ISSRE 2004. 15th International Symposium on","20050124","2004","","","391","402","Early risk assessment is key in planning the development of systems, including systems that involve software. Such risk assessment needs a combination of the following elements; 1) Severity estimates for the potential effects of failures, and likelihood estimates for their causes; 2) Fault trees that link causes to failures; 3) Efficacy estimates of design and process steps towards reducing risk; 4) Distinctions between preventing, alleviating and detecting (thereafter removing), risks; 5) Risk preventions that have potential side effects of themselves introducing risks. The paper shows a unified approach that accommodates all these elements. The approach combines fault trees (from probabilistic risk assessment methods) with explicit treatment of risk mitigations (a generalization of the notion of a detection seen in FMECA analyses). Fault trees capture the causal relationships by which failure mechanisms may combine to lead to failure modes. Risk mitigations encompass (and distinguish among) options to prevent risks, detect risks, and alleviate risks (i.e., decrease their impact should they occur). This approach has been embodied in extensions to a JPL-developed risk assessment tool, and is illustrated here on software risk assessment information drawn from an actual project's software system FMECA (failure modes, effects and criticality analysis). Since its elements are typical of risk assessment of software and its system interface, the findings should be relevant to a wide range of software systems.","1071-9458;10719458","0-7695-2215-7;0769522157","","10.1109/ISSRE.2004.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383134","Cost-benefit tradeoffs;FMEA;FMECA;FTA;Failure Modes;PRA;Probabilistic Risk Reduction;Risk-informed decision-making;SFMECA","Application software;Costs;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault trees;Protection;Risk analysis;Risk management;Software systems;Space vehicles","decision making;fault trees;maximum likelihood estimation;risk management;software development management","FTA;PRA;SFMECA;cost-benefit tradeoffs;failure modes;fault trees;probabilistic risk reduction;risk assessment;risk-informed decision-making;system interface","","7","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate the problem of distributed collaborative defense against coordinated attacks in MANET as a dynamic game problem. In our formulation we have on the one hand a group of attackers that observe what is going on in the network and coordinate their attack in an adaptive manner. On the other side, we have a group of defending nodes (the IDS nodes) that collaboratively observe the network and coordinate their actions against the attackers. Using extensions of the game theoretic framework of [3] we provide a mathematical framework for efficient identification of the worst attacks and damages that the attackers can achieve, as well as the best response of the defenders.

Furthermore, due to their popularity and users ability to create content, Web 2.0 applications have become particularly attractive targets. These trends clearly illustrate the need for better understanding of malicious cyber activities based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster. Therefore, they seem to be clear methods of choice.","1071-9458;10719458","978-1-4673-4638-2;9781467346382","","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405356","Web 2.0 security;attacks;empirical study;multiclass classification;vulnerability scans","Accuracy;Blogs;Electronic publishing;Information services;Internet;Learning systems;Support vector machines","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Internet;J48;PART;SVM;Web 2.0 applications;attack classes;high-interaction honeypot;malicious behavior classification;malicious cyber activities;multiclass machine learning methods;multiclass malicious Web activities classification;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;supervised machine learning methods;support vector machines;three-tier Web system","","4","","34","","","27-30 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046;02780046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","40","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%.

Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (invariants). These invariants are associated with conditions (the observed variables) of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9;0769525539","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7;9781467355247","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment.

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed.

However, like many technologies, there are ways that it can be exploited. One of these ways is through side-channel communication, whereby secret messages are passed along by the purposeful corruption of frames. These side channels can be established by intentionally corrupting the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field by using a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) polynomial that is different from the standard CRC polynomial. Malicious nodes can exploit the fact that normal unsuspecting nodes will drop these frames since they appear as naturally corrupted frames. This paper presents a CRC Hamming distance metric as a feature for the detection of this type of side-channel communication. The proposed detection method applies the Hamming distance measure to compare CRC values that are generated by different CRC polynomials. The hypothesis is that the mean Hamming distance between two CRC values generated by two different CRC polynomials would be significantly far apart than the mean Hamming distance of a CRC value of a frame that was naturally corrupted but was generated by the same CRC polynomial. The results of our real data experiments show that the there is a consistent and significant difference between the mean Hamming values of naturally corrupted frames to those that use the Koopman polynomial to calculate the CRC for side-channel communications. The analysis of the results also demonstrate that the difference of the CRC values that have the the maximum F-Score vary between 10-14 under varying noisy conditions and side-channel throughput.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346831","","Generators;Hamming distance;MATLAB;Noise measurement;Polynomials;Wireless communication","Hamming codes;cryptography;cyclic redundancy check codes;polynomials;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless network;CRC polynomial;CRC-based side-channel communication detection;F-score;FCS;Hamming distance;Koopman polynomial;cyclic redundancy check;frame check sequence;malicious node;mobility characteristic;noisy condition;secret message;side-channel throughput","","","","12","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","1","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While these IT technologies offer high flexibility, interoperability, and convenient administration of ICSs, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. Dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment is a key foundational component of security protection. However, due to the characteristics of ICSs, the risk assessment for IT systems is not completely applicable for ICSs. In this paper, through the consideration of the characteristics of ICSs, a targeted multilevel Bayesian network containing attack, function, and incident models is proposed. Following this proposal, a novel multimodel-based hazardous incident prediction approach is designed. On this basis, a dynamic cybersecurity risk assessment approach, which has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks, is also devised. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the risk assessment, which may be reduced by the redundant accumulation of overlaps amongst different consequences, a unified consequence quantification method is presented. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulation of a simplified chemical reactor control system is conducted in MATLAB. The simulation results can clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to dynamically calculate the cybersecurity risk of ICSs in a timely manner. Additionally, the result of a different comparative simulation shows that our approach has the ability to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks.","2168-2216;21682216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2503399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360925","Bayesian network;cybersecurity;incident prediction;industrial control system (ICS);multiple models;risk assessment","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Control systems;Industrial control;Risk management","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node.

This technique is not suited to find the signatures of DDoS attack, which is formless. Also, DDoS is in general the combination of different forms of denial of service (DoS). As a result, it is difficult to find the exact signature of attack. Moreover, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference between an unusual high traffic which is caused by the attack, and the flash crowds which normally occur when a huge number of users use the target machine at the same time.

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in zombie machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.","0743-166X;0743166X","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441","","IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement","IP networks;Internet;firewalls","IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz.

Further on, we propose a new feature-selection method that ensures globally optimal feature sets. The new approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming problem (M01LP) by using the branchand-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear (O(n)) in the number n of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our GeFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application.

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture.

A goal of this work is to be able to quantify and compare the merits of the different Internet latency reducing techniques, contrasting their gains in delay reduction versus the pain required to implement and deploy them. We found that classifying techniques according to the sources of delay they alleviate provided the best insight into the following issues: 1) the structural arrangement of a network, such as placement of servers and suboptimal routes, can contribute significantly to latency; 2) each interaction between communicating endpoints adds a Round Trip Time (RTT) to latency, especially significant for short flows; 3) in addition to base propagation delay, several sources of delay accumulate along transmission paths, today intermittently dominated by queuing delays; 4) it takes time to sense and use available capacity, with overuse inflicting latency on other flows sharing the capacity; and 5) within end systems delay sources include operating system buffering, head-of-line blocking, and hardware interaction. No single source of delay dominates in all cases, and many of these sources are spasmodic and highly variable.

Industry demands effective protection of assets while reducing the susceptibility of detection systems to unnecessary activation. Hence both the likelihood of intruder detection and the likelihood of unwanted alarm rejection need to be maximised to ensure quality performance leading to effective and efficient asset protection. To provide an indication of different volumetric motion sensing technologies' strengths and weaknesses in these areas, investigation has been made into the performances of dual and quad element passive infrared, and dual technology passive infrared/microwave sensors. This was accomplished by practical testing, with theoretical analyses of the outcomes before comparison of specific detectors to allow interpretations about each technology type.

In our LVSs, a single authorized base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas aims to detect a malicious vehicle that is spoofing its claimed location. We first determine the optimal attack strategy of the malicious vehicle, which, in turn, allows us to analyze the optimal LVS performance as a function of the Rician K- factor of the channel between the BS and a legitimate vehicle. Our analysis also allows us to formally prove that the LVS performance limit is independent of the properties of the channel between the BS and the malicious vehicle, provided the malicious vehicle's antenna number is above a specified value. We also investigate how tracking information on a vehicle quantitatively improves the detection performance of an LVS, showing how optimal performance is obtained under the assumption of the tracking length being randomly selected. The work presented here can be readily extended to multiple BS scenarios and, therefore, forms the foundation for all optimal location authentication schemes within the context of Rician fading channels.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset.

"Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS): a framework for accurate and efficient IDS","Yu-Sung Wu; B. Foo; Y. Mei; S. Bagchi","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","1","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4;9781424446384","978-1-4244-4639-1;9781424446391","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we address the defense needs by leveraging moving target defense protection within Software-Defined Networking-enabled cloud infrastructure. Our novelty is in the frequency minimization and consequent location selection of target movement across heterogeneous virtual machines based on attack probability, which in turn minimizes cloud management overheads. We evaluate effectiveness of our scheme using a large-scale GENI testbed for a just-in-time news feed application setup.

To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust.

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network - - and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5938-4;9781424459384","","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;network security;vulnerability","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Fires;Monitoring;Security;Servers","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","FTM;attack modeling;customer relation system;directed tree;electric power dispatch system;electric power information networks;electric power system;enterprise management networks;faulty tree method;formal logic;industry control computer;management information system;network security administrators;network vulnerability analysis;power system analysis;power system reliability;production control networks;root vertex;safeguard","","0","","15","","","24-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a cost reduction method for the MCMC approach by taking moves, i.e., birth and death, out of the iteration loop of the Markov chain when different moving objects interact. For stable and robust tracking, an ellipse model with stochastic model parameters is used. Moreover, our HMM method integrates several different modules in order to cope with multiple discontinuous trajectories.

These cybercrime activities has ultimately resulted in CC attack classification as a serious problem in network security domain while machine learning has been subjected to extensive research area in intrusion classification with emphasis on improving the rate of classifier's accuracy or improving the data mining model performance. This study is another attempt, using rough set theory (RST), a rule based decision making approach to extract rules for intrusion attacks classification. Experiments were performed on publicly available data to explore the performance of four different algorithms e.g. genetic algorithm, covering algorithm, LEM2 and Exhaustive algorithms. It is observed that RST classification based on genetic algorithm for rules generation yields best performance as compared to other mentioned rules generation algorithms. Moreover, by applying the proposed technique on publicly available dataset about intrusion attacks, the results show that the proposed approach can fully predict all intrusion attacks and also provides prior useful information to the security engineers or developers to conduct a mandating action.","","","","10.1109/Anti-Cybercrime.2015.7351952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351952","Classification;Cyber-terrorism;Cybercrime;Intrusion Prediction;Rough Set Theory","Approximation methods;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Genetic algorithms;Set theory;Yttrium","computer network security;data mining;decision making;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;smart phones","CC activity;CC attack classification;RST classification;cyber attack classification;cyber-crime activity;data mining model performance;electronic device;genetic algorithm;intrusion classification;machine learning;network security domain;rough set theory;rule generation algorithm;rule-based decision making approach;security threat;smart phone","","","","26","","","10-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting attacks within a network by analysing the behaviour pattern has been a significant field of study for several researchers and application systems in IPv4 as well as IPv6 networks. For precise anomaly detection, it is essential to implement and use an efficient data-mining methodology like machine learning. In this paper, we contemplated an anomaly detection model which uses machine learning algorithms for data mining within a network to detect anomalies present at any time. This proposed model is evaluated against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks while selecting the most common and evident features of IPv6 and IPv4 networks for optimizing the detection.

Different solutions have been proposed to optimize Live video streaming (e.g., Multicast) and to optimize VOD streaming (e.g., Cache). Implementation of these solutions at an Internet service provider (ISP) network or at Content Data Network (CDN) can use on-line classification capability of video streaming flows (or sources) into Live streaming type and VOD streaming type to allow proper optimization. Since all streaming applications use the same streaming protocols, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies are practically useless in classifying such applications. In this paper we formulate the problem of on-line video-streaming flow classification. Then, we propose and evaluate two statistical on-line streaming flow classifiers. These classifiers are based on the statistical characterization of the flow packets length. Afterward, we study a slightly different video streaming classification problem, in which we can assume that there are at least X concurrent flows from the same video source, X>1. We propose and evaluate an on-line classifier that decides whether these X flows are Live or VOD. This classifier is based on a simple observation that live streaming flows from the same source transfer the same information almost at the same time, while VOD flows from the same source have larger information offset. The classifiers performance evaluation is based on real traffic dataset. Our single flow best classifier tags 96% of the streams correctly, while our multi-flow classifier successfully tags 96.53% of streams for X=2. We also demonstrate a more complex multi-streaming comparing function that improves the success rate of our algorithm to 97.53% for X>2, but it clearly decreases the algorithm scalability. Finally, additional contribution of this paper includes statistical cha- acterization of live video streaming traffic vs. VOD streaming traffic.","","978-1-5090-1848-2;9781509018482","","10.1109/NCA.2015.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371733","On-line application classification;Statistic application classification;Streaming applications","Classification algorithms;Downlink;IP networks;Internet;Performance evaluation;Streaming media;Uplink","Internet;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication traffic;video on demand;video streaming","CDN;DPI technologies;ISP network;Internet service provider network;VOD streaming;content data network;deep packet inspection technologies;live streaming;on-line flow classification;streaming protocols;time-varying bandwidth;video streaming","","","","11","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate). We evaluate our approach in terms of performance (live detection) and accuracy based on a data set from our partner, Creos Luxembourg S.A., the electricity grid operator in Luxembourg.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2015.7436414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436414","","Context;Monitoring;Network topology;Smart grids;Smart meters;Topology","energy consumption;smart power grids","Creos Luxembourg S.A;advanced software monitoring;alerting system;automated device control;automated meter reading;communication technology;context-dependent consumption;electricity grid;energy consumption;information technology;live machine learning;smart grid;suspicious consumption value detection;suspicious electric consumption detection;two-way communication","","","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a single point of failure . We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

The Cyber-threats Situation Value (CSV) is used to describe the cyber-threats situation. The higher CSV shows worse security situation, on the contrary, the lower CSV shows the better. In order to determine the weights of all cyber-threats, the AHP is used to design the hierarchical CSA index system that could divide all cyber-threats into the Strong, Medium and Weak 3 grey clustering classes. At the same time, the GCA is used to construct the criteria layer of index system. The key components of CSV could be clearly shown by those above ways.

MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system.

This paper presents a starting point in the search for suitable log data by providing a framework for determining exactly which log data that can reveal a specific attack, i.e. the attack manifestations. An attack manifestation consists of the log entries added, changed or removed by the attack compared to normal behaviour.

A novel decentralized and scalable architecture that can be adopted to realize a monitor of the agents' behavior is proposed. We consider agents which may perform different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Agents plan their next actions by following a set of rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they dictate actions that depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. Some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to tampering or spontaneous failure. To detect such misbehaviors we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor using only locally available information. The objective of the work is the definition of a basic framework to automatically realize decentralized intrusion detectors for (hybrid) multi-agent systems where interaction is modeled through logical cooperative protocols.","0191-2216;01912216","978-1-4244-1497-0;9781424414970","","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434902","","Condition monitoring;Fault detection;Intelligent robots;Intelligent transportation systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Remotely operated vehicles;Vehicle safety","mobile agents;multi-agent systems;security of data","cooperative mobile agents;decentralized intrusion detection;faulty behaviors;logical cooperative protocols;scalable architecture;secure cooperative multiagent systems","","13","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on the angle detection accuracy of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme, which is one of primary factors for rapid establishment of FSO links. The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data. The simulation results indicate that this new method can provide high-precision positioning of the laser beams, and the maximum angle detection error of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme can be less than 0.054 (0.94 mrad).","0733-8724;07338724","","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2360313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915668","Fisheye lens calibration;fisheye lens calibration;free space optical link;high-accuracy angle detection;spot location;ultra-wide field-of-view acquisition;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition","Accuracy;Imaging;Interpolation;Laser beams;Lenses;Measurement by laser beam;Optical fiber communication","calibration;laser beams;lenses;optical communication equipment;optical images;optical links;optical projectors;photodetectors","Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter;centroid locating algorithm;fisheye lens calibration algorithm;fisheye lens projection model;free-space optical links;high-accuracy angle detection;high-precision laser beam positioning;incident angle;incident beam imaging spot;integrated optics;natural neighbor interpolation algorithm;ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition scheme","","1","","21","","2014-10-02","Dec.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it is currently unknown how likely an IDS is to detect a given Internet-wide scan pattern and whether there exist sufficiently fast scan techniques that can remain virtually undetectable at large-scale. To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations.

Graphical structure of social networks has encouraged the researchers to use various graph metrics to detect the anomalous activities. One such measure that seemed to be highly beneficial to detect the anomalies was brokerage value which helped to detect the anomalies with high accuracy.

It is considered novel and efficient means for expanding business. As more organizations and individuals start to use the cloud to store their data and applications, significant concerns have developed to protect sensitive data from external and internal attacks over internet. Due to security concern many clients hesitate in relocating their sensitive data on the clouds, despite significant interest in cloud-based computing. Security is a significant issue, since data much of an organizations data provides a tempting target for hackers and those concerns will continue to diminish the development of distributed computing if not addressed. Therefore, this study presents a new test and insight into a honeypot. It is a device that can be classified into two types: handling and research honeypots. Handling honeypots are used to mitigate real life dangers. A research honeypot is utilized as an exploration instrument to study and distinguish the dangers on the internet.

SDNs security concerns include attacks on the control plane layer such as DoS attacks. This paper presents an inference-relation context based technique for the detection of DoS attacks on SDNs.

Most of the applications use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as a signaling protocol to establish and terminate call sessions. To facilitate interconnection, SIP uses gateways and servers that pave way for intruders. However, signaling attack during SIP session causes server congestion and thereby affects Quality of Service (QoS). Existing multiclass SVM uses a maximum of 38 features for achieving low False Positive (FP) with an increased training and testing duration. In this paper, we propose a two-tier fine grained model against signaling attack, by integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an entropy model. The first tier introduces a strong learning phase with minimal feature set classifying the Internet traffic into VoIP and non-VoIP classes. Subsequently, in the second tier VoIP samples are characterized into flooding and non-flooding attacks using an entropy model that is optimized. Performance evaluation results from the experimental test bed shows that the fine grained model detects signaling attacks with high classification accuracy.","2159-3442;21593442","978-1-4799-8639-2;9781479986392","","10.1109/TENCON.2015.7372954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7372954","SIP;VoIP;entropy;machine learning;signaling attack;traffic classification","Entropy;Feature extraction;Floods;Real-time systems;Servers;Support vector machines;Training","Internet telephony;internetworking;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;quality of service;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication congestion control","Internet traffic;QoS;SIP signaling attack detection;VoIP class;entropy model;flooding attack;gateway;high classification accuracy;interconnection;learning phase;minimal feature set;multiclass SVM;nonVoIP class;nonflooding attack;performance evaluation;quality of service;server congestion;session initiation protocol;signaling protocol;support vector machine;two-tier fine grained model;voice over Internet protocol","","","","18","","","1-4 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5;0769524575","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340;00189340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","2","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The recipient directs replies to the sender using this source address. However, the correctness of this address is not verified by the protocol. The IP protocol specifies no method for validating the authenticity of the packet's source. This implies that an attacker can forge the source address to be any desired. This is almost exclusively done for malicious or at least inappropriate purposes. Given that attackers can exploit this weakness for many attacks, it would be beneficial to know if network traffic has spoofed source addresses. This knowledge can be particularly useful as an adjunct to reduce false positive from intrusion detection systems.

In this work, we develop STREAM, a novel STrategic REsource Availability Management system to improve information integrity and availability in an energy constrained CPS environment under the presence of malicious adversaries. The term resource here can be any component of a CPS. The main elements of STREAM are (i) difficult but realistic repeated (adversary-defender) game settings, and (ii) a set of provably optimal defender strategies plus effective heuristics, against equally potent adversary moves. STREAM is based on the concept of dynamic games in sequential game theory, and is the first system to incorporate the realistic behavioral aspect that in many CPSs, both, the class of adversaries, as well as the class of CPS protectors, could move in a covert and stealthy manner in order to outwit the other in the war on resource control. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of STREAM strategies to improve CPS resource availability to the non-adversary, we first conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on a model Smart Grid CPS as a representative example of a CPS. We then follow up the analysis with an extensive simulation study on the standard IEEE 14 smart power grid architecture. The results show that STREAM strategies improve Smart Grid system integrity and availability by approximately upto 67% when compared to nonstrategic approaches.

Instead, intruders perform their attacks through a sequence of intermediary hosts before attacking the target. This type of attack is known as a stepping-stone attack. Stepping-stone detection is to determine if a host machine is being used as a stepping-stone by attackers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for stepping-stone detection using a pervious mapping-based detection method. The technique reduces the detection problem to finding a mapping between two streams of packets. If our algorithm cannot find the mapping, then no such mapping exists. But if there is a mapping, then the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find one and the solution will always be the one with minimum indexed. We provide the proof of the correctness of the algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm has a low time complexity.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network.

To overcome the vulnerabilities of network security researchers have come up with different frameworks of intrusion detection system using data mining. Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier. Experiments have been conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset using WEKA 3.6 library functions.","","","","10.1109/IntelliSys.2015.7361264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7361264","Classifiers;Feature Selection;Intrusion Detection;Majority Vote;NSL-KDD;WEKA Library","Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Search methods;Training data","Bayes methods;Internet;belief networks;computer network security;data mining;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search problems","Bayesian network classifier;HFSA;Internet popularity;J48 classifier;Naive Bayes classifier;anomaly detection;best first;classification preciseness;cost effective intrusion detection system;data mining;ensemble framework;genetic search;hybridized feature selection approach;machine learning methods;network security;public type NSL-KDD dataset;rank search;time effective intrusion detection system;wrapper search methods","","","","23","","","10-11 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work looks at the issue of under what conditions time correlation is a sufficient approach to this problem in the sense that it does not introduce erroneous alert dusters. A formal framework for signature-based IDS event detection is developed to aid this discussion. Through this framework it is shown that, even for the simplest case of a single isolated attack, time correlation is not a sufficient approach for noncoincidently located heterogeneous sensors due to the nondeterministic nature of network propagation delays. An approach is then discussed to include additional information about the knowledge domains of the respective IDS sensors, at a per trigger level, to improve the correlation accuracy.","","0-7803-7978-0;0780379780","","10.1109/PACRIM.2003.1235911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235911","","Clocks;Computer networks;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Observability;Payloads;Propagation delay;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","handwriting recognition;safety systems;sensors;telecommunication security","correlation accuracy improvement;data volume overwhelming;event detection;heterogeneous IDS system;heterogeneous sensor;intrusion detection system;network propagation delay;signature-based IDS alert;time-based correlation","","0","","7","","","28-30 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203;15513203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","1","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Compensation for any performance shortcoming is sometimes effected by resorting to correlation techniques, which could be seen as making use of detector diversity. Such diversity is intuitively based on the assumption that detector coverage is different - perhaps widely different - for different detectors, each covering some disparate portion of the anomaly space. Diversity, then, enhances detection coverage by combining the coverages of individual detectors across multiple sub-regions of the anomaly space, resulting in an overall detection coverage that is superior to the coverage of any one detector. No studies have been done, however, in which measured effects of diversity amongst anomaly detectors have been obtained. This paper explores the effects of using diverse anomaly-detection algorithms in intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that while performance/coverage improvements can in fact be effected by combining diverse detection algorithms, the gains are not the result of combining large, non-overlapping regions of the anomaly space. Rather, the gains are seen at the edges of the space, and are heavily dependent on the parameter values of the detectors, as well as on anomaly characteristics. Based on this study, defenders can be provided with knowledge of how combinations of diverse, sequence-based detectors behave to effect detection performance superior to that of a single detector.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2282-3;0769522823","","10.1109/DSN.2005.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467796","","Computer science;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Diversity reception;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Performance gain;Protocols;Security","fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;security of data","anomaly detector performance;anomaly-detection algorithm;intrusion detection;sequence-based detector","","0","","21","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2418434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090949","Data mining;insider attack;intrusion detection and protection;system call (SC);users' behaviors","Computers;Data mining;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","","","","0","","","","2015-04-21","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

It first proposes an unsupervised feature selection algorithm, which is an enhancement over the Laplacian score method, named an Extended Laplacian score, EL in short. Specifically, two main phases are involved in EL to complete the selection procedures. In the first phase, the Laplacian score algorithm is applied to select the features that have the best locality preserving power. In the second phase, EL proposes a Redundancy Penalization (RP) technique based on mutual information to eliminate the redundancy among the selected features. This technique is an enhancement over Battiti's MIFS. It does not require a user-defined parameter such as beta to complete the selection processes of the candidate feature set as it is required in MIFS. After tackling the feature selection problem, the final selected subset is then used to build an Intrusion Detection System. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed detection system are evaluated using three well-known intrusion detection datasets: KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ dataset.

It involves optimization over a different objective and a doubled set of Lagrange multipliers. One might consider our approach as a joint estimation of the support for different probability distributions per class where an ultimate goal is to separate classes with the largest possible angle between the normal vectors to the decision hyperplanes in the feature space.

Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted).

P2-AC organizes the transition rules in multiple stages and processes in pipeline manner, which significantly simplifies the DFA state transition graph into a character tree that only contains forwarding edges. In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle.

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers. We carried out theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard for discovery, blocking, and traceback of malicious traffic.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2465934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182328","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor;intrusion detection system;malicious traffic","Bandwidth;Law;Logic gates;Malware;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;digital forensics;invasive software;law;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;TorWard;administrative complaints;botnet traffic;denial-of-service attack traffic;dual-tone multifrequency signaling-based approach;forensic traceback;intrusion detection system;legal complaints;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic traceback;malware traffic;spam;suspect connections;university campus","","0","","55","","2015-08-07","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, every intrusion detection approach has been limited by their problems: signature-based intrusion detection can identify the known intrusions but cannot detect the novel intrusions, anomaly-based intrusion detection has the potential to detect all intrusions but has the limitation of a higher false alarm rate. For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, it is also found that static analysis (Wagner, et al., 2001), with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495951","","Access control;Authentication;Computational efficiency;Computer applications;Face detection;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling","digital signatures;feature extraction;program diagnostics","anomaly-based intrusion detection;behavior model;feature vector;information security infrastructure;model inaccuracy;model incompleteness;signature-based intrusion detection;static analysis","","4","1","27","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the key problems with implementing IDS on mobile platforms is the increased power consumption. This paper presents low power circuits that implement the string matching tasks within the Snort IDS. These tasks can take up to 80% of the power consumed for Snort. The circuit presented is based on memristor crossbars and evaluate Snort rules at 0.013mW per signature. The circuits are easy to program, utilizing only two resistance states for the memristors.

First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276;15361276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","2","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

With the increasing number of companies resorting to employ resources in the cloud, the protection of the users' data is becoming a significant issue of concern. This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network. The data captured will undergo intense data mining through clustering and then performing classification using BOAT algorithm to detect the presence of intruders on the cloud.

This elevated view highlights opportunities for network defense by revealing shortcomings in existing approaches. We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy.

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper focuses on the design aspects of such an intrusion detection system by integrating different artificial intelligence techniques and a mobile agent architecture. Specifically, IBM's Aglets (TM) Software Development Kit (ASDK) is used as the base agent architecture, along with adaptive resonance theory (ART-2) neural networks for network pattern classification, and a fuzzy logic controller for decision/action resolution.

Static analysis methods are able to identify many known vulnerabilities; however, they suffer from a high rate of false-positives. The creation of a mechanism that can verify identified vulnerabilities is therefore warranted.

The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter.

Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods.

Proceedings. 36th Annual 2002 International Carnahan Conference on","20021210","2002","","","191","197","Intrepid MicroTrack is the first leaky coaxial cable sensor to utilize FM CW radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is one of the widely used intrusion detection techniques. However, many ANN-based methods are faced with unsatisfactory results and low detection precision. A new intrusion detection method by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is proposed. PNN divides inputs into two groups, normal and abnormal. Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time. Experimental results on KDDCUP99 dataset show that our PNN-based method yields average better performance than other well-knowns such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes and BPNN respecting precision, recall and F-value.","","978-1-4673-7678-5;9781467376785","","10.1109/ICNC.2015.7378154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378154","intrusion detection;network intrusion;probabilistic neural network","Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probabilistic logic;Training","feedforward neural nets;probability;security of data","ANN;BPNN;KDDCUP99 dataset;artificial neural network;decision tree;detection precision;feed forward process;naive Bayes;network intrusion detection;network security problems;neurons;probabilistic neural network","","","","32","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This passive line sensor detects disturbances to commercial FM radio signals caused by an intruder moving in proximity to an open transmission line relative to the same radio signal received on a central reference antenna. The product utilizes a totally new type open transmission line and associated signal processing technique so as to determine the location of the intruder along the sensor line and to permit the use of exactly the same cable structure along the entire cable length. This new open transmission line was designed to be used buried beneath a surface, laying on a surface or suspended in air. By simultaneously processing signals from two or more FM stations the RadioGuard product provides redundancy in case of station failure as well as improved performance due to frequency diversity. The general principles of synergistic radar, the design of the open transmission line, and the specific signal processing techniques used in RadioGuard are described.

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands/measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage power grid and a corporate network, we discuss how cyber threats, vulnerabilities and attacks might degrade the functionalities of SCADA and corporate network, which, in turn, might lead to outages of the electrical grid. We represent SCADA and corporate network under malware propagation, Denial of Service and Man In The Middle attacks and predict their consequent performance degradation.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","1","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process.

The framework uses unsupervised learning at runtime, can perform fast anomaly detection on the fly, and can quickly adapt to system load fluctuations and user behavior shifts. Our evaluation of the approach against a real Emergency Deployment System has demonstrated very promising results, showing the framework can effectively detect covert attacks, including insider threats, that may be easily missed by traditional intrusion detection methods.","","","","10.1109/WICSA.2016.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516831","Data Mining;Security;Software Architecture","Data mining;Intrusion detection;Java;Runtime;Software systems","","","","","","","","","5-8 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks.

It then raises an alarm whenever any anomalous network behaviors outside the boundaries of its training sets are observed. However, anomaly based IDS are usually prone to high false positive rate due to difficulties involved in defining normal and abnormal network traffic patterns. In this paper, we employ two different statistical methods viz. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression (LR) to develop new anomaly based IDS models. We then evaluate the performance of these IDS models on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set and analyze their performance against other IDS models based on Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that the performance (Accuracy and Detection Rate) of both the LDA and the LR based models are at par and in some cases even better than other IDS models. Moreover, unlike the IDS model based on complex method like the SVM, the proposed LDA and LR based IDS models are computationally more efficient, which makes them more suited for deployment in real time network monitoring and intrusion detection analysis.","","978-1-4673-7398-2;9781467373982","","10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443533","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7443533","C4.5;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA);Logistic Regression (LR);NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Data models;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;regression analysis;security of data;support vector machines","C4.5;IDS;LDA;LR;SVM;acceptable behavior recognition;anomalous network behaviors;anomaly based intrusion detection system;benchmark NSL-KDD data set;intrusion detection analysis;intrusion detection systems;linear discriminant analysis;logistic regression;naive Bayes;network traffic patterns;performance evaluation;real time network monitoring;statistical methods;support vector machine","","","","15","","","17-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective is to detect the adversary as quickly as possible while satisfying certain detection error constraints. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is constructed to systematically analyze the proposed scheme.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9;9781467362399","978-0-7695-4952-1;9780769549521","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6;9781467364256","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The packet is checked by common detection using the common-rule. If this step detects nothing, the packet is forwarded to its destination. If not, it is passed into the extended detection using the group-rule. Through grouping of similar detection rules, the search space and searching time can be greatly minimized. Using the simplified rule in intrusion detection, the packet inspection time can be largely reduced.

In this paper, we design an adaptive multi-level secure computation algorithm with the goals of reducing the average communication overheads. The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected.

However, binary protocol reverse engineering has been a new challenge in recent years for approaches that traditionally have dealt with text-based protocols rather than binary protocols. In this study, the authors propose a novel approach called PRE-Bin that automatically extracts binary-type fields of binary protocols based on fine-grained bits. First, a silhouette coefficient is introduced into the hierarchical clustering to confirm the optimal clustering number of binary frames. Second, a modified multiple sequence alignment algorithm, in which the matching process and back-tracing rules are redesigned, is also proposed to analyse binary field features. Finally, a Bayes decision model is invoked to describe field features and determine bit-oriented field boundaries. The maximum a posteriori criterion is leveraged to complete an optimal protocol format estimation of binary field boundaries. The authors implemented a prototype system of PRE-Bin to infer the specification of binary protocols from actual traffic traces. Experimental results indicate that PRE-Bin effectively extracts binary fields and outperforms the existing algorithms.","1751-8628;17518628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2015.0797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452480","","","Bayes methods;reverse engineering","Bayes decision model;automatic binary protocol reverse engineering;back-tracing rules;binary field boundaries;binary field features;binary protocols;binary-type fields;bit-oriented field boundaries;bit-oriented format extraction approach;fine grained bits;optimal clustering number;optimal protocol format estimation;protocol message format extraction;silhouette coefficient;target protocol specifications;text-based protocols","","","","","","","4 14 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach.

A complete list of fields of research and buzzwords associated with automatic analysis would extend beyond this document. The importance of this topic stems from the amount of data currently produced in research, engineering, and other fields. The size of these data sets renders manual analysis infeasible. Automatic analysis methods are required to cope with the data sets produced. The algorithms for filtering, categorization, and analysis have a long tradition and are manifold. This raises the question for the best algorithm. The authors of this paper give an overview about manifold automatic analysis approaches along with a classification of these approaches with regard to three different fields of research.","","978-1-4799-2829-3;9781479928293","","10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821018","analysis;clustering;comparison;correlation;data mining;genetic algorithm;graph search;machine learning;monitoring;resilience;sequence alignment;visualization","Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Genomics;Heuristic algorithms;Monitoring;Sociology;Statistics","data analysis;pattern classification","categorization;classification;filtering;large data set automatic analysis;manifold automatic analysis approach","","0","","71","","","16-19 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since CCR is a device which is made up three mutually orthogonal mirrors, an incident ray sent toward CCR can be reflected back in the opposite direction of the incident ray. Using this characteristic, the distance between sensor node and source can be calculated by measuring the difference in detection time of source and sink. However there is a short detection range problem because the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR is not strong enough to be detected. So we analyze reflection process using MEMS CCR and base station, and simulate using analysis of reflected power of ray. And we suggest MEMS CCR array instead of single MEMS CCR to overcome weak power problem and analyze the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR array. It is expected that the analysis in this research can be utilized as a mathematical baseline of MEMS CCR to be distributed in optics-based sensor network.","2093-7121;20937121","978-89-93215-05-2;9788993215052","","10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6703927","MEMS CCR;Sensor node localization;ToF;Wireless sensor network","Arrays;Lasers;Optical reflection;Optical sensors;Optical variables measurement;Sensor systems","microsensors;mirrors;optical sensors;retroreflectors","MEMS CCR array;corner cube retro-reflector array;incident ray;optics-based sensor node localization;orthogonal mirrors;ray reflected power;reflection process;theoretical analysis","","2","","8","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678;15450678","978-1-4673-1423-7;9781467314237","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9;9781479941919","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a gray box since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8;9781424438358","978-0-7695-3816-7;9780769538167","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","2","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the basic SIP specifications do not require the proxy servers to track the states of established sessions, an extension header field Session-Expires has been proposed for SIP to allow the proxy server to hold resources for established sessions just within the specified periods. In this paper, we identify a novel denial of service (DoS) attack utilizing this SIP extension to drain resources of the proxy servers in wireless VoIP. In particular, by deliberately setting a large value of the Session-Expires'' header and then physically disconnecting from the wireless network, attackers can repeatedly hold resources of the proxy server as long as they want. Also, the low-volume nature of the attack allows it to avoid being detected by existing volume-based intrusion detection systems. As a counter-measure, we propose a robust detection scheme based on the statistical Anderson-Darling test. The key insight that leads to the scheme is the changed statistical property of the header values induced by the attack. We validate the performance through computer simulation. The scheme shows its ability to detect the attack and is even more effective when applied against the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684028","","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Robustness;Servers;Wireless networks","Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical testing;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;SIP-based wireless VoIP network;Session Initiation Protocol;attack detection;distributed denial of service attack;proxy server;resource-drained attack;session control;session management;session-expires;statistical Anderson-Darling test;statistical property;volume-based intrusion detection system","","2","","12","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within this framework, it becomes possible to quantify, e.g., the robustness of a user's proof of authorization to possible perturbations in the system, how close an unauthorized user is to satisfying a particular policy, and relative top-k style rankings of the best users to carry out a particular task. To this end, we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions for assessing the robustness of authorization decisions, and develop criteria under which these types of functions can be composed with one another.

One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP header. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we study four practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice.

Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protective signaling systems,<sup>1</sup> however, are definitely not in the communication field, as the only use of communication facilities in these services is for signaling between the protected premises and the central receiving headquarters.","0095-9197;00959197","","","10.1109/EE.1944.6440507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6440507","","Capacitance;Detectors;Ducts;Fires;Relays;Tuning;Wires","","","","0","","","","","Oct. 1944","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20080715","2008","","","173","178","The existing intrusion detection systems are of varied type and hence show distinct preferences in detecting certain types of attacks with improved accuracy, while performing moderately on the other types. With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple Intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement in comparison to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-2414-6;9781424424146","978-1-4244-2415-3;9781424424153","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565049","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","Data analysis;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Service oriented architecture;Social network services","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","advanced sensor fusion technique;data-dependent decision fusion;enhanced intrusion detection;neural network supervised learner unit","","3","","28","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks.

However recently, most of the researches focus on only one of them, and decouple the survivability and security each other. According to the trust model in social networks, this paper proposes an efficient scheme which is resilient to both fault and intrusion based on trust relationship for IP networks. This scheme not only borrows the trust rating from the social links, but also qualitatively describes the relationships between the trust rating and the network behavior. Then, this paper analyses the scheme how to tolerate three known malicious behaviors, viz., self-faults, bad mouth attacks and conflict behavior attacks. Finally, our scheme can detect the malicious nodes fast and accurately and efficiently prevent these malicious behaviors in IP networks.","2163-0771;21630771","978-4-88552-232-1;9784885522321","978-4-88552-231-4;9784885522314","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773800","IP networks;fault-tolerant;intrusion-tolerant;resilient;trust-based","Cryptography;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Helium;IP networks;Mouth;Resilience;Robustness;Scalability;Social network services","IP networks;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","IP network faults;TSIPN model;malicious attacks;network survivability;social network security;trust-based resilient scheme","","0","","13","","","14-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a centralized controller, the process of updating networks becomes much more convenient when compared to traditional networks. However, even with SDNs, transitional network states during network updates may still cause problems. Such states may result in a breakdown of isolation guarantees or other critical constraints and this could lead to incorrect behavior or even security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel abstraction for network updates, inter-flow consistency, that can account for relationships and constraints among different flows during updates. We present a generic inter-flow consistency constraint, version isolation, and a special case, spatial isolation. We propose update scheduling algorithms based on dependency graphs and a data structure that captures dependencies among different update operations & network elements. We also implemented a prototype system on a Mininet OpenFlow network and Ryu SDN controller to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is able to enforce inter-flow consistency constraints with reasonable overheads and that overheads for version isolation are higher than for spatial isolation. Furthermore, when only spatial isolation constraints are in use, overheads on update times for flows that have no isolation constraints are very small (around 1%).","","","","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346859","","Bandwidth;Communication networks;Conferences;Packet loss;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security","centralised control;computer network security;data structures;graph theory;software defined networking;telecommunication control","Mininet OpenFlow network;Ryu SDN controller;SDN update abstraction;centralized controller;control planes;data planes;data structure;dependency graphs;inter-flow consistency;inter-flow constraints;network updates;security vulnerabilities;software defined networks;spatial isolation;transitional network;update scheduling algorithms;version isolation","","1","","21","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we advocate the use of a hybrid approach, in which each type of cache acts as a module in a system with shared memory and storage space. A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation. Our results indicate that a hybrid system is able to provide better savings than a proxy cache, or a standalone RE system. The hybrid system requires less memory, less disk space and provides a speed-up ratio equal to three compared to an RE system.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4577-2052-9;9781457720529","978-1-4577-2051-2;9781457720512","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363843","Hybrid Cache;Redundancy Elimination;Traffic deduplication;WAN optimization","Bandwidth;Encoding;Memory management;Optimization;Redundancy;Servers;Streaming media","Internet;shared memory systems;wide area networks","WAN links;Web optimization;cache modules;chunk level deduplication;hybrid approach;object level deduplication;proxy caches;redundancy elimination systems;redundant bytes removal;shared memory;standalone RE system;static scheduler;storage space;trace driven emulation","","4","","16","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature.

Masquerading is an important factor for identity theft and current authentication systems using traditional methods woefully lack mechanisms to detect and prevent it. This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0;9781424450190","978-1-4244-5020-6;9781424450206","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","4","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource. We describe how this may be extended to securely set up an interactive session on a remote host, and the additional security issues associated with interactive session management. We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files. We also propose a new approach to scoping the security needs of grid systems by defining three generic scenarios: mutual trust, partial trust and mutual distrust.

In this paper we present a distributed architecture for an Intrusion Detection System, allowing for traffic analysis at different granularity levels, performed by using the best available techniques.

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms. In addition, as FVMs make use of the computational resources of the system we will present an algorithm for sharing of the FVMs so that they can be guided to search for the symptoms in the VMs with higher priority.","1541-7719;15417719","978-1-4673-2444-1;9781467324441","","10.1109/EDOC.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337247","Cloud;security;virtualisation","Algorithm design and analysis;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","FVM;Internet;VM;cloud computing;cloud security;command & control module;forensic virtual machines;human pathology;identifying symptoms;malicious behaviour;malware detection;virtual machines","","8","","19","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security of IMS networks has not been fully examined. This paper presents a novel DoS attack against IMS. By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test. Through trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that our defense mechanism can throttle this DoS attack within a short defense time window while generating few false alarms.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-3512-8;9781424435128","978-1-4244-3513-5;9781424435135","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062173","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer science;Information analysis;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Resonance light scattering;Signal generators;Subscriptions;Telecommunication traffic","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;security of data","3G networks;IMS networks;IP multimedia subsystem;chain reaction DoS attack;chained automatic reaction;change-point detection;defense time window;malicious attack;malicious clients;multimedia services;non-parametric GRSh test;online early defense mechanism","","8","","30","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These extracted parameters among all parameters of each normal behavior have a relation with each other which could be computed by regression relations. Each behavior has some pairs of selected parameters including the independent parameter and the dependent one. As an inline detection process, we look at the value of selected parameters of each current session and put them into their computed regression relation. If the computed value of the dependent parameter of each pair has a value greater then what we compute by their regression relation, it will be considered as a deviation. Number of deviations per session and the combination of them is used to label a session as normal or attack.

A common trend in the evaluation of NIDS is to use a narrow selection of publicly or privately available rule-sets and traffic. Private rule-sets and traffic make the repeatability of experiments difficult while publicly available rule-sets and traffic often lack the diversity to explore the NIDS's true operating range. This can cause misleading results in the face of inputs that do not adequately test the NIDS. To improve diversity and provide better context for evaluations it is necessary to employ synthesized traffic and rules in addition to the use of public or private traffic and rule-sets. This research expands on previous models and tools to provide systematic means for increasing the diversity and context of any evaluation providing for a broader perspective from which to view NIDS performance and compare results.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417740","","Automata;Context;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Market research;Ports (Computers);Privacy","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance evaluation;diversity improvement;network intrusion detection system evaluation;private traffic;privately available rule-set selection;public traffic;publicly available rule-set selection","","","","19","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/65.283931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=283931","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems","computer networks;network operating systems;open systems;security of data;telecommunication network management","abuse;audit trails;heterogeneous computer networks;host-based IDS;intruder behavior;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;monitored network traffic;network-based IDS;open mode;rulebased misuse models;security;statistical anomaly;unauthorized actions;unauthorized use","","163","81","36","","","May-June 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many research works were conducted to improve IDS's accuracy by reducing the rate of false alerts and eliminating outliers. In this paper, we propose a three-stage process to detect false alerts and outliers. In the first stage, we cluster the set of elementary alerts to create a set of meta-alerts. Then, we remove outliers from the set of meta-alerts using a binary optimization problem. In the last stage, a binary classification algorithm is proposed to classify meta-alerts either as false alerts or real attacks.

In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data.

Nevertheless, all the features of dataset are not relevant for classifying different attacks. So, feature selection can improve the stability and accuracy of IDS.

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection Systems are deployed to detect infections, but they raise many correlated alerts for each infection, requiring a large manual investigation effort. This paper presents a novel method with a goal of determining which alerts are correlated, by applying Neural Networks and clustering, thus reducing the number of alerts to manually process. The main advantage of the method is that no domain knowledge is required for designing feature extraction or any other part, as such knowledge is inferred by Neural Networks. Evaluation has been performed with traffic traces of real bot binaries executed in a lab setup. The method is trained on labelled Intrusion Detection System alerts and is capable of correctly predicting which of seven incidents an alert pertains, 56.15% of the times. Based on the observed performance it is concluded that the task of understanding Intrusion Detection System alerts can be handled by a Neural Network, showing the potential for reducing the need for manual processing of alerts. Finally, it should be noted that, this is achieved without any feature engineering and with no use of domain specific knowledge.","","","","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2016.7502344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502344","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Neurons;Training","invasive software;neural nets;pattern clustering","bot malware infections;enable botmaster;form botnets;intrusion detection alerts;intrusion detection systems;neural network;pattern clustering","","","","","","","13-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fuzzy mapping algorithm has been specially designed for the mapping of the unidentified pattern according to the clustering principle of normal and abnormal pattern in the normal and attack period of time. It provides the computation foundation, on which the concept of the unidentified pattern can be introduced into the anomaly detection of privileged programs providing host services. Experiment results indicate that the proposed modeling method of anomaly detection evidently increases the deviation of attack behaviors from normal profile, and ultimately increases detection capability against known and unknown attacks.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event. We evaluate various machine learning methods as disturbance discriminators and discuss the practical implications for deploying machine learning systems as an enhancement to existing power system architectures.","","","","10.1109/ISRCS.2014.6900095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900095","SCADA;Smart grid;cyber-attack;machine learning","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Protocols;Relays;Smart grids","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system faults;security of data","cyber-attack discrimination;machine learning;power system architectures;power system disturbance;power system operators","","3","","37","","","19-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces noise due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2574-1;0769525741","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","18","7","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011;10816011","0-7695-2136-3;0769521363","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","16","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes.

Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n.

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Bandwidth;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Quality of service;Resource management;Security;Switches","","","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to detect known and newly emerging malware at a high precision using layer 3 and layer 4 network traffic features. The framework leverages the accuracy of supervised classification in detecting known classes with the adaptability of unsupervised learning in detecting new classes.

In traffic monitoring, a new recognition paradigm is proposed in which it minimizes unnecessary recognition. Therefore, the purpose of traffic monitoring is two-folds; to reduce amount of data to be recognized and to avoid unnecessary recognition.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680854","Classifier combination;False positive rate;Intrusion Detection;SCADA;Security","Accuracy;Data models;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Testing","SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;security of data;unsupervised learning","DNP3;Ethernet/IP;MODBUS;SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;data injection;electricity generation;gas production;oil production;public networks;standard protocols;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsupervised intrusion detection technique;unsupervised learning algorithms;water treatment","","1","","41","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Foreseen applications include safety applications, traffic efficiency enhancements, and infotainment services. To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","3","","31","","2012-12-21","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree.

The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. As the importance of MANET increases day to day, the vulnerability issues in MANET is important to be considered.

NRS can be used for detecting polymorphic worms since these worms often remain the same relationship between bytes in changing their patterns. Two signature generation algorithm based on expectation-maximization (EM) and Gibbs Sampling are designed to generate NRS. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRS and the correctness of the process of signatures generation. Experiment results show that our approach of defending polymorphic worm based on NRS is more effective than other approach based on existed signatures.","","978-1-4244-4600-1;9781424446001","978-0-7695-3738-2;9780769537382","10.1109/HPCC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167013","","Atherosclerosis;Change detection algorithms;Cryptography;Frequency;High performance computing;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Sampling methods","digital signatures;expectation-maximisation algorithm;invasive software;sampling methods","Gibbs sampling algorithm;NRS;expectation-maximization algorithm;neighborhood-relation signature;polymorphic worm detection;signature generation algorithm","","1","","13","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security risks caused by the static nodes are avoided in the proposed scheme. The status of the nodes in the network is completely equal and the credit values that vary with the operation of the network are the only criterion to measure their responsibilities.

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5;0780394615","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate interaction partners. A distributed, node-centric approach to reputation management processes nodal behavior feedback and provides a reputation index that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations.

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

In this paper, by gratuitous ARP request packets, we propose a solution to the problem of ARP poisoning. Our suggested mechanism which is named a Gratuitous Decision Packet System (GDPS) seeks to achieve two main goals: (1) Detection of suspicious ARP packets, by implementing a real-time analyzing for received ARP packets. (2) The distinction between a legitimate and malicious host through sending a modified request packet of the gratuitous ARP packets. Furthermore, the experiments show that the presented design has the efficiency and accuracy, as well as it does not require any additional software or hardware.","","978-1-4673-2630-8;9781467326308","","10.1109/DCABES.2012.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385293","ARP Cash Poisoning;Man In The Middle attack;Network Security","Economic indicators;IP networks;Local area networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Unicast","access protocols;computer network security;local area networks;transport protocols","ARP poisoning problem;ARP request packets;ARP spoofing attack prevention;Ethernet topology;IP address mapping;LAN;MAC address;address resolution protocol;gratuitous decision packet system","","0","","21","","","19-22 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Creating Vulnerability Signatures Using Weakest Preconditions","D. Brumley; H. Wang; S. Jha; D. Song","","20th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF'07)","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1063-6900;10636900","0-7695-2819-8;0769528198","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","10","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The AMCS algorithm uses an improved representation for antigens (corresponding to network access patterns) and detectors (corresponding to detection rules). In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

The marked information is used to reconstruct the IP address of the ingress router connected to the attack source at the detecting end. The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out.

The focus is not only on compression but also on database management through planning and best practice adoption to improve operational efficiency, and provide lower costs, privacy and security. The focus in this summary is on the compression part of the DMBS system for intrusion detection. We present a methodology employing grammar-based and large alphabet compression techniques which involves the generation of multiple dictionaries for compressing clustered subfiles of a very large data file. One of the dictionaries is a common dictionary which models features common to the subfiles. In addition, non-common features of each subfile are modeled via an auxiliary dictionary. Each clustered subfile is compressed using the augmented dictionary consisting of the common dictionary together with the auxiliary dictionary for that subfile.","","978-0-615-15314-8;9780615153148","","10.1109/ITA.2007.4357581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357581","compression;data anonymization;database management;encryption;grammar-based compression;large alphabet;metadata;multiple compression dictionaries;privacy preserving;relational database","Automatic control;Automation;Best practices;Control systems;Costs;Database systems;Dictionaries;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Technology management","data compression;data integrity;data privacy;dictionaries;pattern clustering;security of data;very large databases","data consistency;data integrity;data privacy;data redundancy;database management system;grammar-based compression;intrusion detection compression technology;large alphabet compression;multiple dictionary generation;pattern clustering;very large data file","","0","","7","","","Jan. 29 2007-Feb. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way.

The arising few-mode interference pattern changes are monitored and the responses to a variety of deformations on the fiber link are investigated.

Threat detection systems should be more intelligent because threats are becoming more dangerous. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a potential network security solution for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and information resources. A fast and effective IDS for mobile networks that does not violate the user's privacy or the network's QoS is required. This paper offers a set of flow-based features that can be utilized for mobile network traffic as a prerequisite for a privacy-aware and QoS-robust IDS. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used for reduction of the features. Twelve features in six groups, which represent the user data in mobile traffic, were extracted and evaluated for IDSs. The evaluation process achieved a F-measure weighted average equal to 0.834, and the experimental time was equal to 12.9 seconds. The accomplished measurements have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed set of features.","","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500483","Internet of Things (IoT) security;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs);feature extraction;mobile traffic","Feature extraction;Internet of things;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunications","mobile communication;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PCA;QoS;flow-based features;intrusion detection system;mobile network traffic;mobile networks;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile traffic;network security;principal component analysis;security risks;threat detection systems;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","1","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown.

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by Danger Theory and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using this approach an engineer specifies certain hard and soft performance requirements for a multi-processor system, and allows it to be generated automatically by competitive evolution/optimisation, thus obviating the need for detailed design. To make the proposal concrete, we use the Intel IXP1200 network processor as a baseline complex system design and show how various improvements can be make to this architecture by evolutionary/competitive design. Various approaches to multi- objective optimisation (Darwin, Lamarck Baldwin, etc.) are compared and contrasted in their ability to generate architectures meeting various constraints. We also present an assessment of a proposed architecture with reference to four different packet processing roles. The merits of an island clocking scheme versus a common clocking scheme are also discussed. Our paper highlights the flexibility that this framework bestows on the designer, along with the potential to achieve cost savings and performance improvement.","","978-1-59593-580-9;9781595935809","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579528","design space exploration;evolutionary approaches;object oriented","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Costs;Design engineering;Design optimization;Evolutionary computation;Power engineering and energy;Process design;Proposals;Space exploration","evolutionary computation;integrated circuit design;logic design;microprocessor chips;object-oriented methods","Intel IXP1200 network processor;common clocking scheme;competitive optimisation;cost analysis;design space exploration;island clocking scheme;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimisation;multiprocessor system;network processor design framework;object oriented techniques","","0","","44","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, to avoid matching the attack payload to a NIDS signature, attackers split the payload into several TCP packets or hide it between benign messages. We observe that different attack instances can be derived from each other using simple transformations. We model these transformations as inference rules in a natural-deduction system. Starting from an exemplary attack instance, we use an inference engine to automatically generate all possible instances derived by a set of rules. The result is a simple yet powerful tool capable of both generating attack instances for NIDS testing and determining whether a given sequence of packets is an attack. In several testing phases using different sets of rules, our tool exposed serious vulnerabilities in Snort - a widely deployed NIDS.

This phase has been tested with our university intranet web server's log file. We have tested successfully the SQL injection for unauthorized access.

To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block.

For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011;10816011","978-0-7695-3168-7;9780769531687","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","37","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic. We conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed detection scheme against the C-Worm.

One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves.

Intruders becoming smarter in obfuscating web requests to evade detection combined with increasing volumes of web traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-hosted and on-premise business applications have made it evident that the existing approaches of mostly static signature lack the ability to cope with novel signatures. A SQLIA detection and prevention solution can be achieved through exploring an alternative bio-inspired supervised learning approach that uses input of labelled dataset of numerical attributes in classifying true positives and negatives. We present in this paper a Numerical Encoding to Tame SQLIA (NETsQlIA) that implements a proof of concept for scalable numerical encoding of features to a dataset attributes with labelled class obtained from deep web traffic analysis. In the numerical attributes encoding: the model leverages proxy in the interception and decryption of web traffic. The intercepted web requests are then assembled for front-end SQL parsing and pattern matching by applying traditional Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This paper is intended for a technique of numerical attributes extraction of any size primed as an input dataset to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented using Two-Class Averaged Perceptron (TCAP) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TCLR) respectively. This methodology then forms the subject of the empirical evaluation of the suitability of this model in the accurate classification of both legitimate web requests and SQLIA payloads.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502997","NETSQLIA;SQL Injection;SQLIA;SQLIA neurons;numerical attributes encoding","Artificial neural networks;Databases;Encoding;Feature extraction;Numerical models;Pattern matching;Supervised learning","Internet of Things;SQL;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","ANN;Internet of Things;IoT;NFA;SQL injection attacks;artificial neural network;astronomical rise;bio-inspired supervised learning;cloud-hosted business applications;non-deterministic finite automaton;numerical encoding;on-premise business applications;statistical machine learning;two-class averaged perceptron;two-class logistic regression;web traffic","","","","15","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level. We present an ontology-based approach to correlation, and describe how it can be implemented as a distributed, highly scalable system.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","2166-0077;21660077","978-1-4673-4942-0;9781467349420","978-1-4673-4940-6;9781467349406","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1;9781424457861","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such situations, the availability of the system is compromised and the system suffers the vulnerability of denial of service (DoS). In this paper, we propose a defensive executing technique and analyze its effectiveness. Our technique concurrently executes multiple paths of a transactional processes based on the prediction generated by a discrete time Markov chain.

In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium.

Therefore, mobile broadband operators need to provide much needed security without sacrificing the network performance which calls for the joint provisioning of QoS and security technologies.

We consider the scenario where a well informed intruder divides his attack over multiple packets in order to increase his chances of successfully intruding a target domain. Each fragment of the attack is transmitted through a different path using multi-path routing, where each path is selected with a different probability. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for the case where the attack is split over multiple packets using game theory.

Reliable detection of network intrusions is an important problem, misclassification of an intrusion is an issue in and of itself reducing overall accuracy of detection. A variety of potential methods exist to develop an improved system to perform classification more accurately. Feature selection is one potential area that may be utilized to successfully improve performance by initially identifying sets and subsets of features that are relevant and nonredundant. Within this paper explicit pairings of features have been investigated in order to determine if the presence of pairings has a positive effect on classification, potentially increasing the accuracy of detecting intrusions correctly. In particular, classification using the ensemble algorithm, StackingC, with F-Measure performance and derived Information Gain Ratio, as well as their subsequent correlation as a combined measure, is presented.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2015.7359407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","F-Measure performance;StackingC;data retrieval;ensemble algorithm;ensemble learning;feature pairings;feature selection;information gain ratio;information retrieval;misclassification;network intrusion detection;network intrusions;reliable detection","","","","20","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to allow for a coordinated integration of existing information security technologies, a fusing multi-defense technology optimization model is proposed, which takes into account not only the security aspect but also its impact on the performance, usability, and cost. The relative preference among the objectives can be adjusted by varying the weights associated with each parameter of mathematic model.

To enhance performance, rules are typically compiled into a matching automaton that can quickly identify the subset of rules that are applicable to a given network packet. While deterministic automata provide the best performance, previous research has shown that such automata can be exponential in the size and/or number of rules. Nondeterministic automata can avoid size explosion, but their matching time can increase quickly with the number of rules. In contrast, we present a new technique that constructs polynomial size automata. Moreover, we show that the matching time of our automata is insensitive to the number of rules. The key idea in our approach is that of decomposing and reordering the tests on packet header fields so that the result of performing a test can be utilized on behalf of many rules. Our experiments demonstrate major reductions in space requirements over previous techniques, as well as significant improvements in matching speed. Our technique can uniformly handle prioritized and unprioritized rules, and support applications that require single-match as well as multi-match.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2489182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295611","Firewalls;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Monitoring;Packet Classification;Packet classification;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network monitoring","Automata;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Polynomials;Runtime","authorisation;deterministic automata;firewalls","access-control system;compact packet matching automata;condition factorization;deterministic automata;intrusion detection;nondeterministic automata;rule-based matching","","","","45","","2015-10-09","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA).

Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs.

Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes.

A large number of devices connected over the Internet leads to an increase in vulnerabilities and security threats, which makes the identification of critical assets necessary. Asset identification helps organizations to identify and to respond quickly to any security breaches. In this paper, machine learning based techniques are used to identify assets based on their connectivity, i.e., servers and endpoints. For the analysis presented in this paper four different machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest algorithms are used and the performance of these algorithms is assessed in terms of the F-score calculated for each algorithm. Results show that for a given dataset, amongst all four algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved highest accuracy in terms of identifying the assets correctly. However, the Random Forest algorithm is computationally intensive and may not work for large datasets. Naive Bayes algorithm yielded the worst performance and KNearest Neighbor's performance was very close to that achieved by Support Vector Machines.

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.","1066-6192;10666192","978-1-4673-0226-5;9781467302265","","10.1109/PDP.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557","","Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches","IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing","HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path","","1","","14","","","15-17 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, a lack of comprehensive labeled Synchrophasor data along with other system related information imposes challenges to the development and evaluation of data mining algorithms that can classify power system cyberpower events. In this work, a WAMS cyber-physical test bed was developed using a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. Commercial control and monitoring devices, hardware, software, and industry standard communication networks and protocols were combined with custom Matlab, Python, and AutoIt scripts to model realistic power system contingencies and cyber-attacks. An automated simulation and control engine was developed to randomize modeled cyber-power events including power system faults, contingencies, control actions and cyber-attacks. Scripts were added to capture heterogenous sensor data and create ground truth labeled datasets. The WAMS cyber-physical test bed is capable of simulating various sized power systems and creating datasets without altering the hardware configuration.

The next generation of IDSs should be designed incorporating reasoning engines supported by contextual information about the network, cognitive information from the network users and situational awareness to improve their detection results. In this paper, we propose the use of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) in conjunction with an IDS to incorporate contextual information into the detection process. We have evaluated the use of FCMs to adjust the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) values defined prior to the data fusion process, which is crucial for the IDS that we have developed.

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

The third method, referred to as variable-length partition with multiple breakmarks (VPMB), is similar to VPSW except that multiple breakmarks are used.

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","978-1-4244-5879-0;9781424458790","","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","10","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks.

Alternatively, the regex can be converted to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for efficient matching, which however may require an extremely large state transition table (STT) due to exponential state explosion [17, 27]. We propose the segmented regex-NFA (SR-NFA) architecture, where the regex is first compiled into modular nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), then partitioned, optimized, and matched efficiently on modern multi-core processors. SR-NFA offers attack-resilient multi-gigabit per second matching throughput, does not suffer from either backtracking or state explosion, and can be rapidly constructed. For regex sets that construct a DFA with moderate state explosion, i.e., on average 200k states in the STT, the proposed SR-NFA is 367k times faster to construct and update and use 23k times less memory than the DFA approach. Running on an 8-core 2.6 GHz Opteron platform, our prototype achieves 2.2 Gbps average matching throughput for regex sets with up to 4,000 SR-NFA states per regex set.","1089-795X;1089795X","978-1-4577-1794-9;9781457717949","","10.1109/PACT.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113850","NFA;Regular expression;bit-level parallelism;multi-core processor;thread-level parallelism","Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Multicore processing;Throughput;Vectors","backtracking;finite automata;multiprocessing systems","SR-NFA architecture;attack-resilient multigigabit per second;backtracking;deterministic finite automaton;exponential state explosion;large state transition table;modular nondeterministic finite automata;multicore processor;multicore system;regular expression matching","","3","","27","","","10-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2305;21572305","978-1-4673-1788-7;9781467317887","","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Adaptive software;Assets;Smart grid","Buildings;Cameras;Energy management;Home appliances;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","asset variability;customer domain;engineering adaptive security requirement;monitoring function;primary assets;secondary assets;security control;security countermeasures;smart grid;valuable asset management","","2","","8","","","4-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several diagnostic tools such as Ganglia, Ambari, and Cloudera Manager are available to monitor health of a cluster, however, they do not provide algorithms to detect security threats or perform user activity monitoring. Hence, there is a need to develop a scalable system that can detect malicious user activities, especially in real-time, so that appropriate actions can be taken against the user. At eBay, we developed such a system named Eagle, which collects audit logs from Hadoop clusters and applications running on them, analyzes users behavior, generates profiles per user of the system, and predicts anomalous user activities based on their prior profiles. Eagle is a highly scalable system, capable of monitoring multiple eBay clusters in real-time. It includes machine-learning algorithms that create user profiles based on the user's history of activities. As far as we know, this is the first activity monitoring system on the Hadoop-ecosystem for the detection of intrusion-related activities using behavior-based profiles of users. When a user performs any operation in the cluster, Eagle matches current user action against his prior activity pattern and raises alarm if it suspects anomalous action. We investigate two machine-learning algorithms: density estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In this paper, we introduce the Eagle system, discuss the algorithms in detail, and show performance results. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the density estimation algorithm is 93%, however the sensitivity of our system increases by 4.94% (on average) to 98% (approximately) by using an ensemble of the two algorithms during anomaly detection.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363892","Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster;machine learning;user activity monitoring;user profiles","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Training","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","Big data analytics;Eagle system;Hadoop cluster;Hadoop-ecosystem;PCA;density estimation;eBay;intrusion-related activity;machine-learning algorithm;principal component analysis;security threat;user profile-based anomaly detection","","","","30","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In deep packet inspection, the contents of network traffic are matched against patterns of malicious traffic to identify attack-carrying packets. The pattern matching algorithms employed for deep packet inspection must be fast, as the algorithms are often implemented on middle-boxes residing on high-speed gigabits per second links. The majority of patterns employed in network security applications are regular languages. However, regular language-based patterns have limited expressive power and are not capable of describing some complex features in network payload. Back reference is an important feature provided by many pattern matching tools, e.g., PCRE, the regular expression libraries of Java, Perl, and Python. Back references are used to identify repeated patterns in input strings. Patterns containing back-references are non-regular languages. Very little work has been done to improve the time-efficiency of back reference-based pattern matching. The de facto algorithm to implement back reference is recursive backtracking, but it is vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement back references. The basic idea of our approach is to transform a back reference problem to a conditional submatch problem, and represent it with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)-like machine subject to some constraints. Our experimental results show that our approach resists known algorithmic complexity attacks, and is faster than PCRE by up to three orders of magnitude for certain types of patterns.","","","","10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410264","Back reference;Finite automaton;Network-based Intrusion Detection System;Pattern matching","Resists","finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;security of data","NFA-like machine;back reference-based pattern matching algorithm;conditional submatch problem;de facto algorithm;firewalls;modern network security applications;network-based intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automata like machine;recursive backtracking;regular language-based patterns","","","","28","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4;9781424492114","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of this, the aim of this work is to propose a new approach for detecting anomalies in cloud network traffic. The anomaly detection mechanism works on the basis of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The key requirement for improving the accuracy of the SVM model, in the context of cloud, is to reduce the total amount of data. In light of this, we put forward the Poisson Moving Average predictor which is the core of the feature extraction approach and is able to handle the vast amount of information generated over time. In addition, two case studies are employed to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism on the basis of real datasets. Compared with other approaches, our solution exhibits the best performance in terms of detection and false alarm rates.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502990","Security;anomaly detection;cloud computing;feature extraction;support vector machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Proposals;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer network security;feature extraction;moving average processes;stochastic processes;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Poisson moving average predictor;SVM;cloud anomaly detection;cloud computing;cloud network traffic;feature extraction approach;security mechanisms;support vector machine","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided.

There is a growing demand for deployment to be done secretly. Personnel are obliged to minimize their exposure to hazards and maximize mission effectiveness. Sensor hardware must be exceptionally low-cost in order to be left behind, or considered disposable. Recent developments in noncoherent synergistic radar (NCSR) allow the RF transmitter (sensor) and RF receiver (processing engine) to be deployed wirelessly up to three kilometers away from each other. A 'leaky cable' sensor (ported coax) provides a two-meter wide contour of detection, typically fifty to two hundred meters in length. A miniature antenna provides a two-meter, spherical point-of-detection. For the purpose of this paper, sensing elements include; nonmetallic baseball-sized artificial stones and tree branches, RF miniature antenna, battery circuit and logic. All of which priced to be left behind. The processing engine includes a portable receiver connected to a tripod-mounted directional antenna, located in a safe-zone far away from its related sensing elements. The receiver multiplexes, facilitating the processing of up to sixteen different frequency-coded transmitters (artificial stones). An alarm, resulting from an intrusion into any one of the sixteen spherical point zones is reported to wireless hand-held equipment. Results of a series of tactical field trials are published.

Our work is motivated by the intrusion detection paradigm, but is an attempt to avoid ad hoc approaches to codifying misuse behavior. Our approach is based on the observation that although privileged programs can be exploited (due to errors) to cause security compromises in systems because of the privileges accorded to them, the intended behavior of privileged programs is, of course, limited and benign. The key, then, is to specify the intended behavior (i.e. the program policy) and to detect any action by a privileged program that is outside the intended behavior and that imperils security. We describe a program policy specification language, which is based on simple predicate logic and regular expressions. In addition, we present specifications of privileged programs in Unix, and a prototype execution monitor for analyzing audit trails with respect to these specifications. The program policies are surprisingly concise and clear, and in addition, capable of detecting exploitations of known vulnerabilities in these programs. Although our work has been motivated by the known vulnerabilities in Unix, we believe that by tightly restricting the behavior of all privileged programs, exploitations of unknown vulnerabilities can be detected.

However, these methods couldn't obtain higher detection rates with lower false positive rates. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme to merge the two methods with multi-source information fusion technology. The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system. Also the intrusion detection modules in the new scheme can be self-learning and update the profiles by themselves. Experimental results demonstrate that the over capability of new fusion intrusion detection scheme increased by 15%.","","978-1-4244-5411-2;9781424454112","","10.1109/CIS.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376161","Information Fusion;Intrusion Detection;NAS","Cryptography;Fuses;Fuzzy neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Protection;Secure storage;Storage area networks","authorisation;cryptography;sensor fusion","cryptology tools;low false positive rates;malicious authenticated users attack;multisource information fusion technology;network-attached storage security;storage-based intrusion detection method;system calls","","0","","20","","","11-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since information transmitted in these wireless body area networks (WBAN) often consists of critical and sensitive patient health and personal information, securing these networks is central to their practical deployment in healthcare applications. The objective of this research is to design and develop an intrusion detection framework to improve security in WBAN. In this work, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based intrusion detection system to provide optimal attack detection in these networks. The proposed system guarantees that only those features necessary for detecting a specific attack is used in the intrusion detection process, thereby decreasing the computational complexity.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405510","","Body area networks;Communication system security;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","body area networks;genetic algorithms;health care;security of data;wireless sensor networks","intrusion detection system;multiobjective genetic algorithm;patient health;personal information;wireless body area networks;wireless sensor networks","","","","15","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This requirement often prevents such systems from usage of computational-heavy algorithms for security analysis. To deal with this issue, we built our system based on an in-memory data base with an integrated machine learning library, namely SAP HANA. Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time. To prove our concepts, we measured the processing speed for the developed system on the data generated using Active Directory tested and showed the efficiency of our approach for high-speed analysis of security events.","2379-5352;23795352","978-1-4673-7147-6;9781467371476","","10.1109/ISPDC.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165133","SAP HANA;in-memory;intrusion detection;machine learning;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Databases;Libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Security","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","SAP HANA;active directory;computational-heavy algorithms;data analysis;deep log message normalisation;high-speed security analytics;high-speed security event analysis;in-memory database;in-memory machine learning engine;integrated machine learning library;machine learning analysis;security information and event management systems","","1","","27","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the current IDS work by detecting patterns of behavior of previously known attacks (attack signature). One drawback of signature based IDS is that they are vulnerable to previously unknown attacks. As an alternative, anomaly based IDS use a model of what is considered a normal behavior of a computer system or network and then they could detect any attack, know or unknown. The main problem of this approach is to find an adequate model of normality. In this paper, we present a method to build a model of behavior of computer network and systems. In this model a set of fuzzy organizational states are deduced from time series of computer resources utilization applying the discrete fuzzy transform.","Pending","978-1-61284-968-3;9781612849683","978-1-61284-967-6;9781612849676","10.1109/NAFIPS.2011.5751919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751919","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computers;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Transforms","computer network security;digital signatures;fuzzy set theory;transforms","attack signature;computer anomaly detection;computer networks;computer resources utilization;computer system;discrete fuzzy transform;fuzzy organizational states;information security control;intrusion detection systems","","0","","16","","","18-20 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
