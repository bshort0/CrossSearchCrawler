The security of the outsourced data in the cloud is dependent on the security of the cloud computing system and network. Though, there have been numerous efforts on securing data on the cloud computing system, evaluation of data security on the network between cloud provider and its users is still a very challenging task. The audit of the cloud computing system and network will provide insights on the security and performance of VMs and the operating system on multiple data centers and the intra-cloud network managed by cloud providers and the wide-area network between the cloud user and cloud provider. Thus, network traffic analysis for cloud auditing is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to verify the data security on the network between cloud provider and its users.

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate.

Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously.

Understanding the underlying cause is critical for the deployment of effective response measures aimed at restoring the network functionality. Shebaro et al. [9] proposed an initial approach for fine-grained analysis (FGA) of packet losses, and implemented and evaluated a tool based on it. Such approach profiles the wireless links between the nodes using resident metrics, such as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the link quality indicator (LQI) for every packet, in order to achieve an accurate diagnosis of their root causes. The accuracy of their approach relies on the correct choice of some system parameters and thresholds, and empirically-determined values such as those proposed in their work might not always be optimal. Moreover, to reduce the burden on the network administrator, their approach uses a single threshold value set for the entire WSN, which can be suitable for some neighborhoods but not appropriate for others. In this work, we design an approach that builds a statistical model for determining optimal system thresholds by exploiting the variances of RSSI and LQI. Our model also has the advantage of allowing the setting of an individual threshold for each link. We have validated our approach through extensive MATLAB simulations based on real sensor data, showing that our model is accurate and its system parameters lead to an optimally-accurate fine-grained analysis of the underlying causes of packet losses.","","","","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300899","LQI;RSSI;WSN;interference;variance","Interference;Mathematical model;Packet loss;Testing;Wireless sensor networks","RSSI;wireless sensor networks","LQI;RSSI;link quality indicator;optimal system thresholds;packet losses;received signal strength indicator;resident metrics;statistically-enhanced fine-grained diagnosis;wireless links;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","2","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","2324-898X;2324898X","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulation results have shown that our protocol is more efficient and DoS resistant than the other, in addition to possessing more security merits.","","0-7695-2835-X;076952835X","","10.1109/CNSR.2007.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215512","","Access protocols;Authentication;Computer crime;Computer science;Data engineering;Data security;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Protection","IP networks;cryptographic protocols;internetworking;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP security;denial-of-service;eavesdrop;internet key exchange protocol design;security gateways","","2","","22","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","1","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","47","","2015-03-27","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920  1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented.

Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not.

The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability.

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","12","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

Second, a general behavior perception model is proposed for the unified framework based on hidden Markov random field. Spatial Markovianity is introduced to model the spatial context of distributed network behavior and stochastic interaction among interconnected nodes.

In our LVSs, a single authorized base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas aims to detect a malicious vehicle that is spoofing its claimed location. We first determine the optimal attack strategy of the malicious vehicle, which, in turn, allows us to analyze the optimal LVS performance as a function of the Rician K- factor of the channel between the BS and a legitimate vehicle. Our analysis also allows us to formally prove that the LVS performance limit is independent of the properties of the channel between the BS and the malicious vehicle, provided the malicious vehicle's antenna number is above a specified value. We also investigate how tracking information on a vehicle quantitatively improves the detection performance of an LVS, showing how optimal performance is obtained under the assumption of the tracking length being randomly selected. The work presented here can be readily extended to multiple BS scenarios and, therefore, forms the foundation for all optimal location authentication schemes within the context of Rician fading channels.

Clustering-based intrusion detection technique overcomes the drawbacks of relying on labeled training data which most current anomaly-based intrusion detection depend on. Clustering-based DIDS technique according to the advantages of two techniques is presented. For effectively choosing the attacks, twice clustering is employed: the first clustering is to choose the candidate anomalies at agent IDS and the second clustering is to choose the true attack at central IDS.

This study presents an incremental network traffic classification algorithm called incremental particle swarm optimisation to enhance the performance of IDS. Based on semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation, the proposed algorithm is composed of two major phases: (i) the classification phase is employed to create the classifier for differentiating the type of network flows from the training dataset and (ii) the clustering phase is then used to classify the newly incoming patterns, which may contain known and unknown network flow types.","2047-4954;20474954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2012.0209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584858","","","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;classification phase;clustering phase;efficient network management method;high-quality network services;incremental network traffic classification algorithm;incremental particle swarm optimisation;intrusion detection system;network management system;semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","2155-2487;21552487","978-1-4673-0296-8;9781467302968","978-1-4673-0297-5;9781467302975","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","1","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, this work aims to strike a balance between damages made by the intrusion and cost of response. Cost-Sensitive modeling approach will be used so as to define the cost factors involved. The prototype of the design is briefly discussed.","","978-1-4244-9029-5;9781424490295","","10.1109/CEEC.2010.5606485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5606485","Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Response System;Intrusion detections;false alarms;missed alarms","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computers;Databases;Engines;Intrusion detection","computer network security;groupware","collaborative system;computer network security;cost sensitive intrusion response system;intrusion detection;post-intrusive action;surreptitious attack detection","","0","","9","","","8-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several solutions were proposed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). The main objective of the current work is first to take advantage of data mining techniques such as normalization, feature selection and eliminating redundancies in order to analyze the huge data like the KDDCUP'99. The second objective is the learning ability of neural networks and the third one is the fuzzy logic reasoning that realizes knowledge wave characters. The proposed model is the Neuro-Fuzzy model precisely the NEFCLASS (Neuro Fuzzy Classification) model of a generic fuzzy perceptron which is in the form of a combination of neuron and fuzzy system networks. This model is characterized by its powerfulness thanks to its large database and rapidity due to its parallel architecture. Moreover, it can be easily updated through the re-learning process following the scalability potential inherited in its architecture. As well as it is distinguished by an intuitive model presented by linguistic rules that are easily understood by the security operator. To test out the adaptability of our approach in detecting unknown attacks we use a test database , namely corrected test that contains new attacks that are not present in the training set and compare the results obtained by the model ANFIS. We prove that our approach based on NEFCLASS model is more powerful in classifying intrusions than the one based on ANFIS model. To highlight the motivation for using the Neuro-Fuzzy Classifier, a comparative study was conducted by using the full 10% KDD among the NEFCLASS model and other supervised classifiers which are ANN and C5.0.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507112","Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;NEFCLASS;Supervised classifier;Uncertainty","Cognition;Computational modeling;Databases;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer network security;data mining;database management systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel architectures;pattern classification;perceptrons;resource allocation","ANFIS;ANN;C5.0;IDS;KDDCUP99;NEFCLASS;computer network scability;computer security;data mining techniques;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy system networks;generic fuzzy perceptron;intrusion detection system;intuitive model;knowledge wave characters;learning ability;linguistic rules;neural network;neuro-fuzzy classification;neuro-fuzzy classifier;parallel architecture;relearning process;resource availability;resource confidentiality;resource integrity;supervised classifiers;test database","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","2329-6267;23296267","978-1-4244-3763-4;9781424437634","","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate).

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message INVITE of Death crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152 seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5;9781612844275","978-0-7695-4367-3;9780769543673","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence in this paper, we first assume the role of an attacker to launch evasion attacks on anomaly detection systems. We show that the ADSs can be completely paralyzed by parameter estimation attacks. We then present a mathematical model to measure evasion margin with the aim to understand the science of evasion due to ADS design. Finally, to minimize the evasion margin, we propose a key-based randomization scheme for existing ADSs and discuss its robustness against evasion attacks.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance.

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","2","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as flow key. FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow.

However, it is currently unknown how likely an IDS is to detect a given Internet-wide scan pattern and whether there exist sufficiently fast scan techniques that can remain virtually undetectable at large-scale. To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying unknown attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641;10972641","978-1-4244-9330-2;9781424493302","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they have the shortcoming that there are undetectable intrusions according to types for each measure and modeling method because each intrusion type results in anomalies. We propose a multiple-measure intrusion detection method to remedy this drawback of conventional anomaly detectors.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model.

To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform.

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users. Autonomic systems can be effective in securing organizational knowledge assets and in reducing the potential damage from malicious users","1083-4427;10834427","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2006.871724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632283","Autonomic computing;game theory;intrusion detection;secure knowledge management","Asset management;Availability;Computer crime;Computer displays;Costs;Databases;Explosions;Humans;Information security;Knowledge management","computer crime;game theory;knowledge management","autonomic computing;enterprise knowledge assets;game theoretic analysis;hacking;secure knowledge management system;self-healing mechanism","","3","","42","","","May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditionally, PCA is performed in a centralized manner, which has poor scalability for large distributed systems, on account of the large network bandwidth cost required to gather the distributed state at a fusion center. Consequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA algorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without losing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between communication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a real domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply the distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and demonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods has little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in communication bandwidth.","","","","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460567","Data partitioning;Distributed PCA;Network anomaly detection;Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Distributed databases;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data handling;principal component analysis","DNS query dataset;communication bandwidth;communication cost;communication overhead;data partitioning;dimension reduction method;distributed PCA algorithms;distributed PCA-based methods;distributed principal component analysis;distributed systems;network anomaly detection technique;network bandwidth cost;performance overhead tradeoff;real domain name system","","","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify subsets of samples and subsets of features that jointly specify anomalous clusters. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect botnet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.","1551-2541;15512541","","","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324326","Bonferroni approximation;Gaussian Mixture Model;botnet;dependence tree;group anomaly detection;network intrusion detection;p-value","Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Joints;Peer-to-peer computing","invasive software;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","GAD scheme;anomalies clusters detection;anomalous clusters;anomalous data samples;botnet detection;data batch;feature dependency structure;group anomaly detection problem;low-dimensional feature subsets;low-dimensional subset;network intrusion detection;peer-to-peer flow clusters;real world network traffic flow data;statistical dependencies;test independence","","","","14","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives.

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

Feature selection is a significant method to develop a time and cost effective intrusion detection system. The time consumption in building up the classifiers model enhances the efficiency of the system. This work conducted on the analysis of some approaches of intrusion detection using some machine learning methods with wrapper approaches, which is a type of feature selection methodology. Our paper mainly focuses on the classification preciseness of 3 different classifiers using the minimal amount of features selected by three different wrapper search methods on the well-known public type NSL-KDD dataset and showing the comparisons among them. The 3 basic classifiers are Bayesian Network, Naive Bayes and J48. Best First, Genetic Search and Rank Search have been used as the wrapper search methods. The study proposed an ensemble type of a classification model with a hybrid feature selection method based on the research framework. By using the hybrid feature selection method 12 critical features are chosen and with the combination of basic classifiers, a reliable model is developed to differentiate normal and anomaly. Moreover, the result shows a convenient false positive rate of 0.021. Experiment showed that our proposed ensemble approach showed better result than Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network and J48 classifier.

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort.

It involves optimization over a different objective and a doubled set of Lagrange multipliers. One might consider our approach as a joint estimation of the support for different probability distributions per class where an ultimate goal is to separate classes with the largest possible angle between the normal vectors to the decision hyperplanes in the feature space. Regarding an obvious novelty of our problem we report and compare the results along the lines of standard C-SVM, LS-SVM and One-Class SVM.

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7;9781467326247","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper.

Then different neurons are used to process these two different grouped inputs. Handling separately ensures that normal ones deviate from abnormal ones as far as possible, so as to obtain satisfactory detection results. PNN only needs one feed forward process and does not have any back propagation, thus greatly reducing the training time.

Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enthalpy model in simulating the dendritic growth involving complex shape, and the accuracy of VOF method in conserving mass and preserving the complex dendritic shape during motion.

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels. We show that Gestalt is robust and effective in detecting polymorphic, stealthy variants of known attacks.","","978-1-4244-5850-9;9781424458509","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541822","Anomaly detection;attack accessment;behavioral analysis;finite state machine;netwrok service","Automata;Computer science;Face detection;Information management;Information science;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","23","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks aim to gain ineligible access to users' accounts by trying plenty of different password combinations. The detection of this type of attack at the network level can overcome the scalability issue of host-based detection methods. In this paper, we provide a machine learning approach for the detection of SSH brute force attacks at the network level. Since extracting discriminative features for any machine learning task is a fundamental step, we explain the process of extracting discriminative features for the detection of brute force attacks. We incorporate domain knowledge about SSH brute force attacks as well as the analysis of a representative collection of the data to define the features. We collected real SSH traffic from a campus network. We also generated some failed login data that a legitimate user who has forgotten his/her password can produce as normal traffic that can be similar to the SSH brute force attack traffic. Our inspection on the collected brute force Netflow data and the manually produced SSH failed login data showed that the Netflow features are not discriminative enough to discern brute force traffic from the failed login traffic produced by a legitimate user. We introduced an aggregation of Netflows to extract the proper features for building machine learning models. Our results show that the models built upon these features provide excellent performances for the detection of brute force attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424322","Aggregated Netflows;Brute Force;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Force;Intrusion detection","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","Netflow data;Netflow feature;SSH brute force attack traffic;SSH failed login data;SSH traffic;aggregated netflow data;campus network;computer network;discern brute force traffic;extracting discriminative feature;failed login traffic;host-based detection method;inspection;legitimate user;machine learning approach;machine learning model;machine learning task;network level;password combination;prevalent attack;representative collection","","","","21","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset.

The framework collects network packets and host events continuously in real-time and parses them to a queue of dynamic windows, then it generates connection vectors accordingly. We evaluate the framework in a real-time heterogeneous network and compare it with other benchmark datasets.

However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection.

This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that models normal behaviors with hidden Markov models (HMM) and attempts to detect intrusions by noting significant deviations from the models. Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM.

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized trust no peer mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a neighborhood watch concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X;1062922X","0-7803-7952-7;0780379527","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks.

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","7","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","2374-0221;23740221","978-1-4244-3337-7;9781424433377","","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","8","6","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modelbased thermal anomaly detection mechanism, which compares expected (obtained using heat-generation and -extraction models) and observed thermal maps (obtained using thermal cameras) of datacenters, is proposed. In addition, a novel Thermal Anomaly-aware Resource Allocation (TARA) is designed to induce a time-varying thermal fingerprint (thermal map) of the datacenter so to maximize the detection accuracy of the anomalies.

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

In this paper, a rule evolution approach based on genetic programming (GP) for detecting novel attacks on network is presented and four genetic operators namely reproduction, mutation, crossover and dropping condition operators are used to evolve new rules. New rules are used to detect novel or known network attacks. A training and testing dataset proposed by DARPA is used to evolve and evaluate these new rules. The proof of concept implementation shows that the rule generated by GP has a low false positive rate (FPR), a low false negative rate (FNR) and a high rate of detecting unknown attacks. Moreover, the rule base composed of new rules has high detection rate (DR) with low false alarm rate (FAR).","","0-7803-7804-0;0780378040","","10.1109/CEC.2003.1299940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1299940","","Artificial intelligence;Biological cells;Data structures;Databases;Event detection;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Testing","authorisation;genetic algorithms;telecommunication security","DARPA;crossover;detection rate;dropping condition operators;false alarm rate;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic operators;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;mutation;network attacks;network intrusion;reproduction;rule evolution approach;testing dataset;training dataset","","3","","15","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5;0769518745","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","16","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple Intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes three intrusion detection systems PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement in comparison to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-2414-6;9781424424146","978-1-4244-2415-3;9781424424153","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565049","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","Data analysis;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Service oriented architecture;Social network services","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","advanced sensor fusion technique;data-dependent decision fusion;enhanced intrusion detection;neural network supervised learner unit","","3","","28","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks employ the Cloud to launch denial of service attacks against a target outside the Cloud. Slow-read denial of service can be one of those attacks. It is a new type of application-layer denial of service attacks that exploits vulnerabilities in the HTTP protocol in order to make services inaccessible for legitimate users on a target machine. This attack is difficult to detect by conventional intrusion detection systems, as it generates legitimate and complete packets in all networking layers and in a slow rate. The attack exhausts the target's resources such as Web server connection pool and generally needs much less bandwidth compared to traditional volumetric attacks. The Cloud is an ideal platform to launch slow-read attack, since virtual machines on the Cloud can be easily exploited as a botnet for the purpose of this attack. We show how this new phenomenon, CloudZombie, can happen by remotely launching slow-read attacks from the Cloud. We also present a new approach to detect slow-read attacks. Our method uses Random Forests to build classifiers based on which the incoming slow-read traffic can be detected at the destination.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","4","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them.

"Identifying intrusions in computer networks with principal component analysis","W. Wang; R. Battiti","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Telecommun., Trento Univ., Italy","First International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES'06)","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9;0769525679","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","8","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2;9781424499052","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of intrusion detection is to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. The intrusion detection problem is becoming a challenging task due to the proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks since the increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders and makes it easier for intruders to avoid identification. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions are detectable. Typically, IDSs employ statistical anomaly and rulebased misuse models in order to detect intrusions. A number of prototype IDSs have been developed at several institutions, and some of them have also been deployed on an experimental basis in operational systems. In the present paper, several host-based and network-based IDSs are surveyed, and the characteristics of the corresponding systems are identified. The host-based systems employ the host operating system's audit trails as the main source of input to detect intrusive activity, while most of the network-based IDSs build their detection mechanism on monitored network traffic, and some employ host audit trails as well. An outline of a statistical anomaly detection algorithm employed in a typical IDS is also included.<<ETX>>","0890-8044;08908044","","","10.1109/65.283931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=283931","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems","computer networks;network operating systems;open systems;security of data;telecommunication network management","abuse;audit trails;heterogeneous computer networks;host-based IDS;intruder behavior;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;monitored network traffic;network-based IDS;open mode;rulebased misuse models;security;statistical anomaly;unauthorized actions;unauthorized use","","163","81","36","","","May-June 1994","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via nave bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971;15455971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","6","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7;9781424427697","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","2","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3;9781424469383","978-1-4244-6939-0;9781424469390","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate.

It can offer targeted forensic evidence collection and investigation of computer network attacks. Such unique capabilities are instrumental to network intrusion detection that is challenged by large volumes of data and complex network topologies. This paper presents an innovative approach that coordinates distributed network traffic Monitors and attack Correlators supported by Open Virtual Switches (OVS). The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms. We experiment with this SDN-supported collaborative approach to detect TCP SYN flood attacks on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), a realistic virtual testbed. The response times and detection accuracy, in the context of a small to medium corporate network, have demonstrated its effectiveness and scalability.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357519","Denial of Service;Intrusion Detection;SDN;Threat Containment","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Correlators;Monitoring;Software","computer network security;software defined networking","DDoS containment;TCP SYN flood attack;anomaly detection;attack correlators;attack signature recognition;collaborative DDoS flooding detection;computer network attack;deep packet inspection;distributed network traffic monitors;forensic evidence collection;network flooding attack signature;network intrusion detection;open virtual switch;software defined networking","","","","13","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic.

A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

More and more studies show that communication among internal nodes exhibits complex patterns. Communication among VMs in cloud computing is invisible. Researchers find such issues challenging, and few solutions have been proposed???leaving cloud computing vulnerable to network attacks. This paper proposes a model that uses Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to implement traffic redirection.

These templates can either be user-defined or created from known data sets. We have developed an automated tool called RACOON, which rapidly generates large amounts of user command data from a given template. We demonstrate that our technique can produce realistic data by showing that it passes several statistical similarity tests with real data. Our approach offers significant advantages over passive data collection in terms of being nonintrusive and enabling rapid generation of site-specific data.

These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron.

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2007.901875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991","Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network","","belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data","Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks","","6","1","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157;07303157","978-1-4244-7512-4;9781424475124","978-0-7695-4085-6;9780769540856","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","978-1-4244-3435-0;9781424434350","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","5","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a general sense, the proposed system is a co-located sensor network, in which the monitored variable is the health of the network being monitored. A three level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (intrusion detection systems) are attached to each node of the MANET, collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the difference between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which fuses the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Likewise, cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager node, which fuses the cluster-level indexes into a network-level anomaly index. Due to network mobility, cluster membership and cluster heads are time varying. The paper describes: (1) clustering algorithms to update cluster centers; (2) machine learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes; (3) a statistical scheme for fusing the anomaly indexes at the cluster heads and at the manager. The statistical scheme is formally shown to increase detection accuracy under idealized assumptions. These algorithms were implemented and tested under the following conditions. Routing schemes: AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing) and OLSR (optimized link state routing); mobility patterns: random walk mobility model and reference point group mobility at various speeds; types of attacks: traffic flooding denial-of-service and black hole. For performance evaluation we determined the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) for various operational conditions at the nodes, cluster heads and manager. The overall res- - ults confirm the effectiveness of the infrastructures and algorithms described in the paper, with detection accuracy generally improving as we move up in the hierarchy, i.e. detection accuracy at the cluster level is higher than at local level, while network-level detection outperforms cluster-level detection","2155-7578;21557578","0-7803-9393-7;0780393937","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605939","","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic heads;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services;wireless sensor networks","(optimized link state routing;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;black hole;cluster head;cluster membership;cluster-level anomaly index;colocated sensor network;computer attacks;data collection;data processing;data transmission;distributed anomaly;intrusion detection;local anomaly indexes;machine learning algorithms;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobility patterns;network mobility;random walk mobility model;receiver operating characteristics;reference point group mobility;statistical scheme;three level hierarchical system;traffic flooding denial-of-service","","10","","21","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well.

Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

In this paper, we proposed an anomaly detection approach that is adaptive to the ever-changing network environment.

The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013;15566013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks.

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","7","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0;9781457713750","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results show that the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the D-CAD method is as high as 0.9524, compared to an AUC value of 0.9102 of the supervised maximum-likelihood estimation based anomaly detection method and to an AUC value of 0.8887 of the supervised Bayesian estimation based anomaly detection method.","","1-4244-1075-4;1424410754","1-4244-1076-2;1424410762","10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239021","","Bayesian methods;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Computer science;Fault detection;Maximum likelihood estimation;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","Bayes methods;computer network reliability;maximum likelihood estimation;telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection;divergence-measure based classification method;network traffic;software sensors;supervised Bayesian estimation;supervised maximum-likelihood estimation","","0","","28","","","15-17 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we present a method for automatic generation of fuzzy rules from data. The main advantage of the proposed method is its ability to perform data clustering without the requirement of predefining any parameters including number of clusters. The proposed method creates data clusters at different levels of granulation and selects the best clustering results based on some measures. The proposed method involves merging clusters into new clusters that have a coarser granulation. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, three different datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed method to other classifiers: SVM classifier, FCM fuzzy classifier, subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier. Results show that the proposed method has better classification results than other classifiers for all the datasets used.","","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116825","Fuzzy systems;data classification;data clustering;granular computing","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Input variables;Merging;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering","FCM fuzzy classifier;SVM classifier;automatic generation;coarser granulation;data clustering;fuzzy classification rules;fuzzy modelling;granulation-based adaptive clustering;subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier","","0","","20","","","13-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ground truth node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its major challenge comes from malicious attacks, which cannot be handled by traditional security mechanisms, such as authorization, access control, encryption, etc. Although there existed some intrusion detection systems, current researches on intrusion detection are still insufficient in accuracy and efficiency for two reasons: firstly, most of them implement malicious transaction detection only by matching samples with predefined patterns; secondly, most current researches mainly resort to semantic analyzing or even only manual interventions to judge the malicious attacks. Inspired by the replication technique, we propose and implement a novel logical replication-based intrusion detection solution for CSCW system in this paper.

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6214-6;9781467362146","","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Access Logs;Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Electronic Health Records;Healthcare Security;Insider threats","Context;Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","LDA;ROA model;RTA;RTAD;anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;anomalous user detection;anomaly detection framework;attacker characteristics;feature extraction;healthcare;hospital audit logs;information systems;insider threat detection;k-NN algorithm;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;model formalization;outlier detection;random object access model;random record access;random topic access detection;random topic access model;random users;statistics;strategy development;topic summarization;user roles;workflow knowledge","","0","","13","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

The complete distribution of the intrusion detection process is the salient feature of our proposition: distribution is not restricted to data collection but also applied to execution of the detection algorithm and alert correlation. Each node in the MANET runs a local IDS (LIDS) that cooperates with others LIDS. A mobile agent framework is used to preserve the autonomy of each LIDS while providing a flexible technique for exploring the natural redundancies in MANET to compensate for the dynamic state of wireless links between high mobility nodes. The proposed solution has been validated by actual implementation, which is described in the paper. Three attacks are presented as illustrative examples of the IDS mechanisms. Attack detection is formally described by specification of data collection, attack signatures associated with such data and alerts generation and correlation.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5;9780769532585","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1;9781467323871","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA.

This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529;00189529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","41","3","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives. This is caused by the unstable nature of the wireless medium and also because of the difficulty to model the behaviour of the diverse implementations from different manufacturers. One way to reduce false positives is to combine different techniques to carry out the analysis. We propose a novel method that identifies the impersonation of certain management frames, which helps to reduce the number of false positives within other existing MAC spoofing detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3102-1;9780769531021","","10.1109/ARES.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529384","802.11 MAC address spoofing;false positive","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Personal digital assistants;Protocols","access protocols;computational complexity;message authentication;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 network;beacon MAC frame spoofing attack detection;management frame authentication;protocol","","1","","26","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.","","978-1-4577-0531-1;9781457705311","978-0-7695-4423-6;9780769544236","10.1109/SAINT.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129","OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data","feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data","","3","","16","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997","","Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security","HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold","","1","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For those training data excluded from the profile, we use them to build a specific classifier. The classifier has two distinct characteristics: one is that it regards each data point in the feature space with the limited influence scope, which is served as the decisive bounds of the classifier, and the other is that it has the default label to recognize those novel attacks. We present a novel classification algorithm, influence-based classification algorithm, to deal with ambiguous data. Our system is tested on the KDD Cup 1999 data.

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","2162-8998;21628998","978-0-7695-3843-3;9780769538433","978-1-4244-5068-8;9781424450688","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders becoming smarter in obfuscating web requests to evade detection combined with increasing volumes of web traffic from the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-hosted and on-premise business applications have made it evident that the existing approaches of mostly static signature lack the ability to cope with novel signatures. A SQLIA detection and prevention solution can be achieved through exploring an alternative bio-inspired supervised learning approach that uses input of labelled dataset of numerical attributes in classifying true positives and negatives. We present in this paper a Numerical Encoding to Tame SQLIA (NETsQlIA) that implements a proof of concept for scalable numerical encoding of features to a dataset attributes with labelled class obtained from deep web traffic analysis. In the numerical attributes encoding: the model leverages proxy in the interception and decryption of web traffic. The intercepted web requests are then assembled for front-end SQL parsing and pattern matching by applying traditional Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). This paper is intended for a technique of numerical attributes extraction of any size primed as an input dataset to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented using Two-Class Averaged Perceptron (TCAP) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TCLR) respectively. This methodology then forms the subject of the empirical evaluation of the suitability of this model in the accurate classification of both legitimate web requests and SQLIA payloads.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502997","NETSQLIA;SQL Injection;SQLIA;SQLIA neurons;numerical attributes encoding","Artificial neural networks;Databases;Encoding;Feature extraction;Numerical models;Pattern matching;Supervised learning","Internet of Things;SQL;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","ANN;Internet of Things;IoT;NFA;SQL injection attacks;artificial neural network;astronomical rise;bio-inspired supervised learning;cloud-hosted business applications;non-deterministic finite automaton;numerical encoding;on-premise business applications;statistical machine learning;two-class averaged perceptron;two-class logistic regression;web traffic","","","","15","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior to the monitoring, a system manager will set up several sensitive planes in the world using a GUI (graphical user interface). To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC (peripheral increment sign correlation) method. Then the contour of the object region on a image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3D (three-dimensional) protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary.

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem.

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284;15361284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117","Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis","BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities","","0","","27","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","978-1-4244-0972-3;9781424409723","978-1-4244-0973-0;9781424409730","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We apply statistical techniques to quantify the n-transition patterns in the protocol and determine the probabilities of these transitions being normal.","","978-1-4673-5287-1;9781467352871","978-1-4673-5286-4;9781467352864","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504111","","Communication system security;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Protocols;Security;Training;Wireless networks","computer network security;protocols;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 anomaly-based behavior analysis;IEEE 802.11 wireless networks;MAC address spoofing attack;anomaly behavior analysis;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;banking accounts;confidentiality issue;credit cards;denial of service attack;e-mails;n-gram pattern analysis;n-transition patterns;privacy issue;security issue;security protocols;session hijacking attack;social network credentials;tempo-spatial data analysis technique;transfer critical information;wireless network attacks;wireless networks","","1","","6","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for new countermeasures is clear and urgent as cyber-attacks are more than ever capable of causing loss of human life; destroying the environment, and causing a high level of disruption to critical infrastructures. The impact of cyber-attacks is sometimes comparable to the impact of traditional military actions. However, the lack of understanding of the scope of attacks and how they operate could lead to unsuccessful protection mechanisms. We have analysed attacks targeting IT and business network, and Critical infrastructure, as a result we present four levels of visibility of attacks that need to be considered when designing or implementing security mechanisms. In our discussion of these four levels of visibility of attacks, we particularly focus on one level where malicious users actions are direct threats to the targeted system but yet not visible by the targeted systems.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977;10946977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","18","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset.

In order to assess the performance of the PCC classifier on a real network environment, the relative assumption model together with feature extraction techniques are used to generate normal and anomalous traffic in a LAN testbed.

Intrusion detection models are used to detect the attacks based on the patterns and alerts in case of intruders are being met with the system. In this paper, we propose and implement intrusion-detection system grounded on artificial neural network model such as Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based competitive network, which in turn plays a vital role in detection of malicious nodes based on input data patterns. The proposed model deals with different types of attacks and their detection approach based on SOM model. The approach aids at increasing Detection rate as well as reducing the False alarm rate, which in turn helps to detect those attacks before it makes larger damage to the network and prevent them with supportive techniques and increase the network performance.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3;0769520413","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","32","3","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes.

Based on the dc power flow model and state estimation model, three behavior rules are extracted to depict the behavior norms of each device, such that a device (trustee) that is being monitored on its behavior can be easily checked on the deviation from the behavior specification. Specifically, a rule-weight and compliance-distance-based grading strategy is designed, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the traditional grading strategy for evaluation of trustees. The statistical property, i.e., the mathematical expectation of compliance degree of each trustee, is particularly analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, which achieves satisfactory tradeoff between detection accuracy and false alarms to detect more sophisticated and hidden attackers.

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","1573-0077;15730077","1-4244-0798-2;1424407982","1-4244-0799-0;1424407990","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature. We further see that the standard classifiers are better able to classify an anomalous message when L is small.","1573-0077;15730077","978-1-4244-9219-0;9781424492190","978-1-4244-9220-6;9781424492206","10.1109/INM.2011.5990708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990708","","Fires;Grammar;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Routing protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","ASCII message representation;Euclidean classifiers;Internet;Levenshtein distance;SIP messages;UDP;anomalous message detection;machine learning algorithms;message encryption;multimedia session establishment protocol;self-learning systems;self-similar session initiation protocol","","3","1","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Allowing white spaces to be used in a deregulated manner exposes the radio spectrum to anomalous usage, which in turn may intentionally or unintentionally cause interference to primary users (PUs) as well as secondary users (SUs). In this paper we propose a subspace-based spectrum guarding detector (SSGD) to address the security of unauthorized spectrum usage. In particular, we consider the scenario where ongoing authorized transmissions by PUs have to be preserved from concurrent unauthorized emissions in the same frequency bands. The detector operates in two phases: a training phase where SSGD collects samples of the authorized transmissions, and a detection (on-line) phase where the spectrum is guarded against anomalous emissions. The performance of SSGD is analyzed in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities highlighting the effects of the propagation scenario, the PU characteristics, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the duration of both training and on-line phases. Numerical results show that in practical scenarios SSGD provides a remarkable SNR improvement of several dB over the conventional energy detector (ED).","2164-7038;21647038","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247214","","Cognitive radio;Covariance matrices;Detectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal to noise ratio;Training","cognitive radio;error statistics;next generation networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","PU;SNR improvement;SSGD;anomalous emission;authorized transmission;cognitive radio;concurrent unauthorized emission;dynamic spectrum access;energy detector;false alarm probability;next generation wireless network;phase detection;primary user;secondary user;signal-to-noise ratio;spectrum efficiency;subspace-based spectrum guarding detector;training phase;unauthorized spectrum usage security;white space","","","","26","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Interval type-2 Fuzzy logic system is incorporated to solve the sharp boundary problem and decide whether a sequence is normal or not. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively detect intrusions and reduce false positive alarms.","","978-1-4577-0247-1;9781457702471","","10.1109/ICSSEM.2011.6081303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081303","anomaly intrusion detection;hidden markov model;interval type-2 fuzzy logic system;soft computing;system calls","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;High definition video","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;hidden Markov model;interval type-2 fuzzy logic;sharp boundary problem;soft computing technique","","0","","18","","","22-23 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, one of the most significant challenges in this area is the poor detection rate, due to the presence of excessive features in a data set whose class distributions are imbalanced. Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion. The results on 1998 DARPA data show that the our method results in low false positive rate with high detection rate.","2156-2318;21562318","978-1-4244-1717-9;9781424417179","978-1-4244-1718-6;9781424417186","10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4582476","","Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Sequences;Surveillance","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","fuzzy HMM;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;pattern recognition","","4","","12","","","3-5 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it.

Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics.

One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)).

Smartphones, in particular, have become more than personal assistants. These devices have provided new avenues for consumers to play, work and socialize whenever and wherever they want. Smartphones are small in size; so they are easy to handle and to stow and carry in users pockets or purses. However, mobile devices are also susceptible to various problems. One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users private lives. In addition, this might enable pervasive observation or imitation of ones movements and activities, such as sending messages to contacts, accessing private communication, shopping with a credit card, and relaying information about where one has been. This paper highlights the potential risks that occur when smartphones are stolen or seized, discusses the concept of continuous authentication, and analyzes current approaches and mechanisms of behavioral biometrics with respect to methodology, associated datasets and evaluation approaches.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2016.2537748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423666","Authentication;Smartphone;User Behavior","Authentication;Biomedical monitoring;Biometrics (access control);Mobile handsets;Privacy;Tutorials","","","","","","","","2016-03-02","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To protect the valuable data of their clients, organizations implement security systems to detect and prevent security breaches. But since the intruders are using sophisticated techniques to penetrate the systems, even the highly reputed secured systems have become vulnerable now. To deal with the current scenario, advanced level of researches are required to be carried out to invent more sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Among various methodologies, researchers consider Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a very effective and popular tool for developing an IDS. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient BPNN architecture for the development of an anomaly based IDS with high accuracy and detection rate. The KDD'99 data set is used in this context to develop the architecture.","","978-1-4799-6928-9;9781479969289","","10.1109/CICN.2014.221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065641","Anomaly detection;Artificial neural network;BPNN;Intrusion Detection System;KDD '99 data set;Network security","Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;neural nets","BPNN architecture;anomaly based IDS;anomaly based intrusion detection system;back propagation neural network architecture;client data;robust supervised learning neural network;security breach detection;security breach prevention;security system;security vulnerability;valuable data protection","","0","","25","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Probabilistic model checking for AMI intrusion detection","M. Q. Ali; E. Al-Shaer","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A comparison of system call feature representations for insider threat detection","A. Liu; C. Martin; T. Hetherington; S. Matzner","Signal & Inf. Sci. Lab., Texas Univ. at Austin, TX, USA","Proceedings from the Sixth Annual IEEE SMC Information Assurance Workshop","20050815","2005","","","340","347","This paper investigates anomaly detection techniques that have been successful for detecting external threats and applies them to the insider threat problem. The insider threat involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the external threat involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work.","","0-7803-9290-6;0780392906","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495972","","Business;Computer vision;Data security;Government;Histograms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Testing","information systems;security of data","anomaly detection system;external threat detection;histograms;information access;information assurance;information dissemination;information systems;insider threat detection;intrusion detection system;outlier detection;sensitive information;system call feature representation;system call names;tamper resistance;trust;user privilege","","13","","18","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
