Users can easily access cloud while offloading their mobile applications from anywhere anytime. Being easy to access, intruder attacks mobile networks to acquire credential from mobile applications inside and outside the cloud computing. To investigate intruder's attacks, digital investigator has to identify the root cause of the attack. However, investigating MCC infrastructure is difficult due to its characteristics of virtualization, dispersion of data, multi tenancy, interoperability, and mobility. In this paper, we present an overview of MCC and digital forensics, focusing on its key aspects and significant forensic challenges faced by digital investigators in MCC. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding about forensic research challenges and re-direct researchers towards new research areas.","","978-1-4799-4556-6;9781479945566","","10.1109/I4CT.2014.6914202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914202","Forensic;Investigation;Mobile cloud computing","Cloud computing;Companies;Digital forensics;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets","cloud computing;digital forensics;mobile computing","MCC;distributed resource networks;forensic challenges;intruder attacks;mobile applications;mobile cloud computing;mobile networks","","1","","31","","","2-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new key management method that the shared keys are dynamic updated for wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme loads two hash functions and an initial key into the base station, cluster heads, and sensor nodes. Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station. The security of this scheme is analyzed and it shows that it is robust to the guessing attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and node capture attacks.

Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication.

MADAM detects and effectively blocks more than 96% of malicious apps, which come from three large datasets with about 2,800 apps, by exploiting the cooperation of two parallel classifiers and a behavioral signature-based detector.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.","0738-100X;0738100X","978-1-4244-6677-1;9781424466771","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522352","I/O access control;Virtual machine;smart phone security;virtual machine monitor","Access control;Batteries;Degradation;Equations;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Secure storage;Security;Smart phones","","","","0","","23","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4577-2027-7;9781457720277","978-1-4577-2026-0;9781457720260","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","2","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS.

To achieve stealthiness when attacking a mobile device, an effective approach is the use of a covert channel built by two colluding applications to exchange data locally. Since this process is tightly coupled with the used hiding method, its detection is a challenging task, also worsened by the very low transmission rates. As a consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy consumed by the device.

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6;9781467315906","978-1-4673-1589-0;9781467315890","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also important, however, to automatically respond to the attack and maintain the power discharge at the normal level. In this study, we introduce a method designed to detect the defective process and to self-correct the abnormality by stopping or delaying the suspicious actions. The proposed system monitors system calls and the power usage of a local process, and delays activation of the abnormal system calls until the system calls can be run without hampering the battery life.

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","4","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to detect selective forwarding attack effectively, we propose the sequential mesh test based detection scheme in this paper. The cluster head node detects the packet drop nodes based on the sequential mesh test method after receiving the packet drop reports. This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion. We show through experiments that our scheme can provide a higher detection accurate rate and a lower false alarm rate than the existing detection scheme.

Hierarchical methods are more efficient for this. Apart from achieving energy efficiency, the load on balancing and security are essential. Security Aware Energy Balanced Hierarchical Protocol (SEBHP) builds a clustered hierarchical routing tree and minimizes the energy utilization by selecting efficient relay nodes and routing path and implements security by means of introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.","","978-1-4673-0681-2;9781467306812","","10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493","","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","1-1 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a PIDS using GPRS and CDMA dual-mode wireless sensor networks (DM-WSNs) to deliver an optimal data transmission service. Moreover, Auto Shutdown mechanism is proposed to address the energy conservation for battery powered sensor devices.

Routing protocols for MANET are responsible for mobility of wireless networks and these are the common target of these threats. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) is commonly employed and an efficient routing protocol. Black hole attack is a common active and internal attack which can misdirects the routing in reactive protocols. In this paper, a solution is proposed to avoid Black hole attack in AODV.

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path. Such type of node is continuously sending the control and data packets in the network, hindering the connection establishment. An adaptive approach is proposed which involves taking an alternate path to the destination which is less congested in order to complete the message transfer.","2347-9337;23479337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012833","Congestion;flooding;wireless network","Conferences;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trusted computing","adaptive approach;denial of service attack;distributed detection;infrastructureless wireless network;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;packet flooding;trust based transmission method","","0","","10","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We discuss a detailed threat model to mobile devices in the real world to develop an ACM fitted to mobile devices. Then, we propose a novel multi-layer access control mechanism for mobile devices, which provides strong protection against the identified mobile threats as well as performance efficiency. Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-1456-7;9781424414567","978-1-4244-1457-4;9781424414574","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","978-1-4244-1094-1;9781424410941","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","7","4","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes are deployed randomly over an area in order to sense various physical phenomena related parameters. The nodes sense the data within their vicinity and forward the data to the neighboring nodes so as to forward the data towards the base station. However, there may be few malicious nodes present in the network and these nodes falsify the data while communicating. This results in false information gathered by the base station and also exhausting the energy of the nodes in the path. Due to the presence of these untrusted nodes the security of the WSN application is compromised as the false data results in distorted information. So it is necessary to study a trust model, various security threats and their effect on WSN. Trust is essential among the nodes in the WSN so that the data can be forwarded without being modified or distorted. This work examines malicious node attack in the WSN scenario and the energy consumption. In this work TRMsim-WSN simulator has been made use of to model the trust and various security attacks and energy consumption analysis with respective to client nodes, relay nodes and malicious nodes has been carried out.","","","","10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7457012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457012","WSN;malicious;security;trust","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","WSN application;base station;malicious nodes;neighboring nodes;security threats;tiny nodes;trust model;wireless sensor network","","","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy. Simulation results manifest that the proposed schemes offer significant energy efficiency and highlight their flexibility.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2217387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296725","Channel awareness;energy efficiency;opportunistic transmission scheduling;optimal stopping","Data communication;Energy consumption;Minimization;Quality of service;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer power supplies;energy consumption;minimisation;stochastic processes;wireless channels","battery lifetime;channel-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling;communication energy consumption;data transmission;distributed scheduler;energy efficiency;energy-efficient wireless link;minimization approach;optimal stopping theory;power level;stochastic characteristic;terminal device;time scheduling strategy;transmission energy consumption;transmission power consumption;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless device","","9","","32","","2012-09-06","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
