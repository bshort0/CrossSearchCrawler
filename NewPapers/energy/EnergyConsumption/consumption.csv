"TERP: A Trust and Energy Aware Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Network","A. Ahmed; K. A. Bakar; M. I. Channa; K. Haseeb; A. W. Khan","Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia","IEEE Sensors Journal","20151007","2015","15","12","6962","6972","In most of the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), nodes operate in unattended environments and are, therefore, vulnerable to variety of attacks. Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions. This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context. The key dimensions are energy budget, computing power and memory size of nodes, location-based security threat levels, data coherence, and data lifetime.

A range of symmetric-key distribution protocols exist, but these protocols do not scale effectively to large sensor networks. For a given level of security, each protocol incurs a linearly increasing overhead in either communication cost per node or memory per node. We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment. We show that, unlike existing key-establishment protocols, both the communication and memory overheads of PIKE protocols scale sub-linearly (O(√n)) with the number of nodes in the network yet achieving higher security against node compromise than other protocols.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8968-9;0780389689","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497920","","Base stations;Batteries;Computer architecture;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Elliptic curve cryptography;Energy consumption;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization","cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PIKE;asymmetric key cryptography;network security;peer intermediaries for key establishment protocol;peer intermediary;resource-constrained platform;sensor network;symmetric-key distribution protocol","","76","3","20","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station). In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided. Secondly, a brief survey of IDSs proposed for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is presented and applicability of those systems to WSNs are discussed. Thirdly, IDSs proposed for WSNs are presented.

Using distribution transformer meters, areas with a high probability of energy theft are short listed, and by monitoring abnormalities in consumption patterns, suspicious customers are identified. Application of appropriate classification and clustering techniques, as well as concurrent use of transformer meters and anomaly detectors, make the algorithm robust against nonmalicious changes in usage pattern, and provide a high and adjustable performance with a low-sampling rate.

FPT 2009. International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8;9781424443758","978-1-4244-4377-2;9781424443772","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","5","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we have implemented S-ACK scheme to transmit the secure acknowledgement. To detect attackers, a trust model is designed. The Forward ant agents transmit back the digitally signed S-ACK through the Backward Ant agent to detect any selective forwarding attack against any source node.

However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation.

Further, clustering of nodes improves scalability, energy efficient routing and data delivery. In this paper, we propose a cluster based secure dynamic keying technique to authenticate the nodes during mobility. The nodes with high configuration are chosen as cluster heads based on the weight value which is estimated using parameters such as the node degree, average distance, node's average speed, and virtual battery power. The keys are dynamically generated and used for providing security. Even the keys are compromised by the attackers, they are not able to use the previous keys to cheat or disuse the authenticated nodes.

This stimulated our research to make use of the limited computational capabilities of these sensor nodes to build a normal model of the data gathered. Hence by having the normal model, anomalies can then be detected and forwarded to a central location. This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes. Experimental results on synthetic data show that Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection is able to provide promising results.","2161-1343;21611343","978-1-4799-5263-2;9781479952632","","10.1109/DeSE.2013.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041095","anomaly detection;distributed data mining;elliptical boundary estimation;two-layered ellipse approach;wireless sensor network","Artificial neural networks;Conferences;Covariance matrices;Data mining;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","outlier preprocessing;partitioned data classification;two-layered data capture anomaly detection algorithm;two-layered ellipse approach;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an architecture in which Intrusion Detection System (IDS) agents are implemented with a distributed manner to monitor the consumer side, building appliances and smart meters.

Therefore, so far there is no signature based IDS which can work on resource constraint sensor nodes. This paper presents a dynamic coding mechanism, which helps in implementing a distributed signature based IDS (intrusion detection system) in IP-USN (IP based ubiquitous sensor networks).

The pulses are transmitted off-chip by the address event representation (AER) protocol, i.e. via a digital bus as the identifying address of the sending pixel. For the motion pixels, this read-out strategy has the advantage of low latency in the order of 100 ns after a change is encountered. (Whereas a scanning read-out strategy would on average suffer a delay of half of the frame scanning period.) Mounted on a pan-tilt system, the peripheral motion detectors could, for instance, be used to steer the imager such that the image of a moving object falls onto the central pixel array where it can then be examined in detail at a higher resolution.

Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks.

One implication of the existence of different hierarchical levels in CGs is that it imposes different access and usage policies on resources. In this paper we firstly highlight the most common Grid users types and their relationships and access scenarios in CGs corresponded to old (e.g. performance) and new (e.g security) requirements. Then, we identify and analyze new features arising in users' behavior in Grid scheduling, such as dynamic, selfish, cooperative, trustful, symmetric and asymmetric behaviors. We discuss also how computational economy-based approaches, such as market mechanisms, and computational paradigms, such as Neural Networks, can be used to model user requirements and predict users' behaviors in CGs.

The limitation is caused by TCAM architecture that reports only the first matching rule. To cope with the limitation, previous algorithms use extra TCAM entries or accesses, or both, to fulfill multi-match packet classification. These algorithms also reorder rules; thus, a multi-match classifier based on these algorithms cannot maintain performance for single-match packet classification. In other words, all matching rules must be yielded to determine the highest priority matching rule. In this paper, we present a TCAM-based scheme for multi-match packet classification without single-match penalty. Our scheme partitions a rule set based on range layering, which can be applied to achieve range encoding. The rule partitioning generates rule subsets which satisfy that the rules in a subset are mutually disjoint. Each rule is then tagged a bitmap for subset identification to fulfill multi-match packet classification. Two approaches, loose coupling and tight coupling, are derived with different search procedures while incorporating range encoding. Both approaches can maintain original rule order, but with different performance tradeoff. We also present a refinement which uses all available TCAM entries to improve the performance of multi-match packet classification. The experimental results show that combining range encoding with multi-match packet classification has advantages of storage efficiency and speed superiority. The capability of supporting single-match packet classification also provides better flexibility of applying different packet actions.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2411274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070777","Geometric intersection;multi-match;packet classification;range encoding;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Encoding;IEEE transactions;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Random access memory","Internet;content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication network routing","Internet routers;TCAM architecture;multidimensional rule layering;multimatch classifier;multimatch packet classification;priority matching rule;range encoding;range layering;reorder rules;rule partitioning;single-match packet classification;subset identification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","47","","2015-03-27","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.","","978-1-4673-0910-3;9781467309103","978-1-4673-0909-7;9781467309097","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486009","","Hidden Markov models;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Load modeling;Monitoring;Power measurement;Sensors","metering;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion;smart power grids","AMI intrusion detection system;AMIDS;advanced metering infrastructures;analog devices;computerized smart meters;cyber events;data sources;information fusion;meter audit logs;multisensor energy theft detection framework;smart grid component;theft-related behavior detection","","8","","24","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Empirical studies show that as the rule set grows larger, power consumption and delay time for processing IP Packets particularly on Hardware firewalls increases extremely, and, therefore the performance of the firewall decreases proportionally. This paper present a new FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) based firewall with high performance, high processing speed, low power consumption, and low space utilization in contrast with early submitted paper in some of credible international conferences. First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption. Based on this model, only the security rules are updated by admin during the configuration process while other hardware part would remain unchanged. The proposed architecture is written in VHDL standard language and it is simulated and synthesized with ALTERA QUARTUS II software. Finally, for validation of proposed architecture, we implemented the synthesized code on 3 of ALTERA FPGAs families (STRATIX III, CYCLONE III, CYCLONE II), and then results have been compared with earlier results.","","978-1-4244-8862-9;9781424488629","978-0-9564263-6-9;9780956426369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678545","","Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Registers;Synchronization","IP networks;authorisation;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","ALTERA QUARTUS II software;FPGA;IP packet;SOC;VHDL;configuration process;field programmable gate array;hardware firewall implementation;pipeline technique;power consumption","","0","","17","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822;17518822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM).

However, those efforts concentrated on preventive techniques constituting a first line of defense (like cryptography and authentication), which are effective in inhibiting the diverse malicious attacks. Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one. The latter line of defense is known as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). While mature in wired and many types of wireless networks, IDSs are envisaged to have more opportunities in WSNs. In this paper, we study the incorporation of IDSs in WSN-based ITSs.

In many IoT applications such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, higher order devices are expected to form the backbone infrastructure, to which the constrained nodes would connect. It would, as such, make sense to exploit the capabilities of these higher order devices to perform network monitoring tasks. We propose in this paper a distributed monitoring architecture that takes benefits from specificities of the IoT routing protocol RPL to passively monitor events and network flows without having impact upon the resource constrained nodes.

Advance metering infrastructure (AMI) is the alternate solution to meet the current demands and challenges of manual metering system. AMI system can be implemented by various methods depending on the communication techniques. In this paper we suggest the hybrid system model for Lahore and Karachi.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

Also, limited capacity of sensor nodes accounts for the security attacks on WSNs. Applications such as military surveillance, traffic surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring are impacted by security attacks. Hence, researchers have created various types of detection approaches against such attacks. Selective forwarding attack is an example of an attack that is not easily detected particularly in the networks layer. In this type of attack, malicious nodes function in the same way as other nodes in the networks. However, it tries to drops the sensitive information prior to transferring the packet to other sensor node. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for detecting and monitoring selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks. The new approach guaranteed to keep the data transferring between nodes safely.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2016.7494104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7494104","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Bandwidth;Hardware;Heat transfer;Monitoring;Reliability;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;energy efficiency;environmental monitoring;healthcare;malicious nodes function;military surveillance;networks layer;security attacks;selective forwarding attack;sensor nodes;traffic surveillance;wireless sensor networks","","","","13","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

None of the existing wireless security protocols considers protection against them. We propose a novel scheme that detects and reduce DoS attacks in the WLANs. The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5;9781467301275","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","2379-5352;23795352","978-0-7695-4879-1;9780769548791","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we examine all routing threats that can target the operation of routing protocol, whether they belong to selfish behaviors or malicious attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","1530-2075;15302075","0-7695-2312-9;0769523129","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8;9781457701108","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","2","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are extremely vulnerable to a variety of misbehaviors because of their basic features like: lack of communication infrastructure, dynamic network topology and short transmission range. To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","1","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.","2162-2108;21622108","978-0-7695-3668-2;9780769536682","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211020","security;wake-up radio;wireless sensor network","Batteries;Communication standards;Communication switching;Cryptography;Protection;Security;Sleep;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;battery powered sensor node;energy saving sleep state;frame cryptographic protection;lightweight security verification scheme;personal area networks;secure wake up scheme;sleep deprivation attack;wireless sensor network","","5","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, several data protection tools and techniques have been presented to enhance the reliability in this emerging technology. One of the most challenging issues in this area is classification of stored data to improve the efficiency of data protection procedure and reduce energy consumption by eliminating un-necessary processes. Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data. The proposed classification index was evaluated by functionality and security parameters. In overall, the results show that the suggested index has considerable benefits in the process of data classification in cloud computing environments.","","978-1-4799-6105-4;9781479961054","","10.1109/SPC.2014.7086229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7086229","Cloud Computing;Cloud Servers;Data Classification;Data Protection;Security","Availability;Cloud computing;Indexes;Process control;Security;Servers","cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy","VDCI;cloud computing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;data privacy;data protection;data security;energy consumption;variable data classification index","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the existing key management schemes concentrate only on network structures and key allocation algorithms, ignoring attributes of the nodes themselves. Due to the distributed and dynamic nature of MANETs, it is possible to show that there is a security benefit to be attained when the node states are considered in the process of constructing a private key generator (PKG). In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes. The proposed scheme can select the best nodes to be used as PGKs from all available ones considering their security conditions and energy states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease network compromising probability and increase network lifetime.","2155-7578;21557578","978-1-4244-5238-5;9781424452385","978-1-4244-5239-2;9781424452392","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379731","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Cryptography;Engineering management;Identity management systems;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Research and development;Research and development management;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;military communication;mobile communication;telecommunication network management","hierarchical identity based key management scheme;military applications;network lifetime;tactical mobile ad hoc networks","","1","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose two simple software-based remote code attestation schemes for different WSN criterion. Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay. Hence, the success of our schemes of attestation does not depend on the accurate measurement of the execution time, which is the main drawback of previously proposed wireless sensor network attestation schemes.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425280","","Costs;Data security;Filling;Hardware;Information security;Laboratories;Protection;Time measurement;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;security of data;wireless sensor networks","WSN;channel collision;communication protocols;execution time;memory noise filling;network delay;post deployment noise filling;predeployment noise filling;sensor nodes;software-based remote code attestation;wireless sensor network","","3","","22","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, to prevent the network from various attacks, scheming of a robust security design is mandatory. Various approaches have been proposed with different cryptographic solutions to countermeasure the attacks against MANET but most of them have focused on specific security threats.

Twenty-third AnnualJoint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies","20041122","2004","4","","2404","2413 vol.4","Security is a critical issue in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of SPREAD.","0743-166X;0743166X","0-7803-8355-9;0780383559","","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354662","","Application software;Computer network reliability;Computer security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;SPREAD scheme;data confidentiality service;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing technique;multiple independent path;path set optimization algorithm;secret message protection;secret sharing scheme;security protocol for reliable data delivery","","64","","26","","","7-11 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","2324-8149;23248149","978-1-61284-295-0;9781612842950","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5;9781424481835","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To fulfill these requirements, there is a need to shift from traditional computing practices to new computing practices that give access to a broader network, unlimited resources, and enables self-service on demand at a reasonable cost using pay per use method. All these requirements can be fulfilled with cloud computing. Cloud Computing has a number of advantages as well as disadvantages. Security is a major threat to the cloud computing because the data placed on cloud servers is always vulnerable as there are lots of attackers on the internet who tries to compromise the security of the cloud. To overcome this issue, we use security appliances in the form of physical machines or by virtualization. A significant amount of power is consumed by security appliances which not only leads to the high energy costs but also a major threat to the environment as carbon-dioxide is released. So there is a need to find optimal solutions for providing security in cloud computing environment in an efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on existing cloud security frameworks has been done.

In this paper, we simulate different scenarios for distributed intrusion detection and we leverage an energy consumption model to evaluate the energy consumption caused by early or late discovery of rogue packets.","","978-1-4673-6239-9;9781467362399","978-0-7695-4952-1;9780769549521","10.1109/WAINA.2013.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550615","Distributed Intrusion Detection;Evaluation;Green Networking;Simulation","Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Load modeling;Network topology;Routing;Topology","Internet;computer network security;energy consumption;power aware computing","IDS strategy;Internet technology;distributed intrusion detection approach;energy consumption simulation;intrusion detection system;wideband technology","","3","","26","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some significant research problems are identified for enlightening the subsequent studies.","1932-8184;19328184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2257594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942184","Cyber-physical system (CPS);intrusion detection;security;security.","Actuators;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Real-time systems;Reliability;Security;Sensors","control engineering computing;embedded systems;industrial control;production engineering computing;security of data","CPS;critical infrastructures;cyber attacks;cyber-physical systems;detection techniques;embedded computers;industrial control systems;instruction detection mechanism;physical processes","","0","","51","","2014-10-31","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, cryptography techniques have proved their ability to assure the privacy of communication, i.e. data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","1550-3607;15503607","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes.

Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks. We propose an anomaly-based approach intrusion detection system (IDS) optimized for ZigBee-based WSN to protect ZigBee-based WSN nodes against KillerBee supported attacks. We describe the KillerBee attack procedure and propose an approach of guarding a ZigBee transceiver.

Its target is to secure internal networks by identifying unusual access or attacks. Machine learning techniques have been playing a significant role in intrusion detection. Considering the large size of training data and time-consuming labeling task, it is wise to select some informative data to train a classifier. Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested. Some popular algorithms of intrusion detection and the combination of active learning and intrusion detection are also introduced.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k. We present several algorithms solving the problems that are either centralized or localized with theoretical proofs and simulation results, showing that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement in practice while the quality of outputs is guaranteed by formal proofs. Our algorithms are based on an interesting relation between our new coverage measure and a certain quantity of a point set, called the bottleneck, which has been relatively well studied in other disciplines.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network.

When WSNs are deployed in inaccessible areas, the probability of occurring different types of attacks is very high. So the security of WSN becomes extremely important. As sensors have limited processing power, limited storage, low bandwidth, and energy; traditional security measures designed for the resource-rich networks such as LAN etc. are not suitable for the resource-constrained WSN. In presence of such limitations it becomes mandatory to devise lightweight security solutions for data transmission in WSNs. Because of problems in public key cryptography such as costly key computation, longer keys, key vulnerability to brute force attack, key distribution and maintenance, etc., it is not preferred for WSN. The less computation and low memory requirements of symmetric key cryptography with very short length of key (lightweight) justifies its use in WSN to achieve information security. Hence, this paper aims to study, discuss and analyze the Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms Suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks.","","","","10.1109/ICCN.2015.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507438","Authenticity;Availability;Confidentiality;Data Freshness;Integrity;Lightweight Cryptography","Communication system security;Cryptography;Monitoring;Schedules;Vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","data transmission;environmental conditions;lightweight cryptographic algorithms;lightweight cryptography;public key cryptography;resource constrained WSN;resource rich networks;small sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, cyber attack scenarios concerning cyber components or networks are considered in the integrated wind farm SCADA/EMS system architecture. Two Bayesian attack graph models are adopted to represent the procedures of successful cyber attacks, and a mean time-to-compromise model is used by considering different attack levels and various vulnerabilities. Frequencies of successful cyber attacks on the wind farm SCADA/EMS system are estimated. A procedure for evaluating the power system reliability is proposed by considering wind turbine trips caused by various cyber attacks.

The digital backbone of the smart grid opens the door for advanced collecting, monitoring, and processing of customers' energy consumption data. One promising approach is the automatic detection of suspicious consumption values, e.g., due to physically or digitally manipulated data or damaged devices. However, detecting suspicious values in the amount of meter data is challenging, especially because electric consumption heavily depends on the context. For instance, a customers energy consumption profile may change during vacation or weekends compared to normal working days. In this paper we present an advanced software monitoring and alerting system for suspicious consumption value detection based on live machine learning techniques. Our proposed system continuously learns context-dependent consumption profiles of customers, e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly profiles, classifies them and selects the most appropriate one according to the context, like date and weather. By learning not just one but several profiles per customer and in addition taking context parameters into account, our approach can minimize false alerts (low false positive rate).

Many of the existing energy efficient routing protocols utilize the power management feature provided by MAC layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 PSM). The rationale behind these protocols is to power down (put in sleep) the redundant nodes that do not involve in the packets routing. To keep a low end-to-end latency and preserve the routing fidelity, a group of nodes are selected to constitute a virtual backbone throughout the network. The backbone nodes do not sleep all the time serving for the packets routing while the rest of nodes turn to sleep mode if there is no packet to send or receive. Backbone nodes are periodically selected and replaced; the current selection and replacement mechanism mainly concerns the energy balance and fairness among the network nodes while the security threat is not considered. In this paper, we present that the adversary may launch security attacks against the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the backbone node selection algorithm. To address this problem, we propose a biased random selection algorithm to prevent the security attacks. The evaluation results indicate that with the aid of reputation system, the proposed biased random selection scheme is more secure than the random selection scheme while trading for a limited amount of power efficiency.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-2324-8;9781424423248","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698160","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Energy management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power system management;Protocols;Routing;Spine","access protocols;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAC layer;biased random selection algorithm;energy efficient routing protocol;power saving;secure virtual backbone-based power management;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an intrusion detection system would reduce the number of false positives if, in addition to the alarm, the system would also transmitted a picture or video of the intruder. The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energy-efficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, SMAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.","2330-989X;2330989X","978-1-4244-4387-1;9781424443871","","10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305150","Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Network;Routing;Sensor;Wireless","Access protocols;Acoustic sensors;Data engineering;Delay;Energy efficiency;Jitter;Media Access Protocol;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","jitter;multimedia communication;transceivers;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multichannel;multimedia application;network delay;network jitter;network throughput;real-time multimedia wireless sensor network;scalar sensor data;throughput capability;transceiver device","","1","","15","","","10-11 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The requirements were developed from both experimental evaluations and computer simulations. This paper gives details of how the PDS 100 PIDS was set up to meet these requirements at an operational site with 30 detection zones. The procedures used were designed to be rigorous enough to ensure that the performance was acceptable, yet quick enough to minimise the time spent commissioning. The tests are based on a calibrated, nondestructive fence tester used to simulate real cutting attacks on the fence. Data from attack trials were used to correlate the signals from real attacks and the fence tester. The commissioning procedure involved one person striking each fence panel, while the generated signals were automatically recorded on a portable computer. This data was used to determine the minimum sensitivity needed for each zone that would have met the required detection rate","","0-7803-1479-4;0780314794","","10.1109/CCST.1994.363775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=363775","","Site security monitoring;TV surveillance systems","alarm systems;commissioning;digital simulation;safety systems","commissioning;computer simulations;minimum probability of detection;nondestructive fence tester;performance standard;perimeter intrusion detection system;portable computer;sensitivity;weather conditions","","0","","5","","","12-14 Oct 1994","12 Oct 1994-14 Oct 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge.

However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists.

Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA.

The proposed protocol ensures node privacy, route anonymity and location privacy and is robust against several known attacks. This limits the chances of eavesdropping and traffic analyzing to a time-critical on-demand window. Anonymity is one of the important characteristics in securing a wireless ad hoc network routing. In this paper we study the unique anonymity threats in wireless ad hoc environments. Two design principles of anonymous routing - anonymous route discovery and anonymous data forwarding are presented here. In the anonymous route discovery design, a random route pseudonym for an on demand route is established. In the anonymous data forwarding design, the source wraps its data packets for each end to end connection. This was implemented and tested using NS-2.0 simulator.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070;02780070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","2","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the proliferation of sensor networks at home, work place, and beyond, securing data in the network has become a challenge. A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604","Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator","Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","2","","31","","2014-12-18","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The lack of infrastructuresupport and resource constraint is the key issue that causesdishonest and non-co-operative nodes. Therefore, MANET isvulnerable to serious attacks. To reduce the hazards from suchnodes and enhance the security of the network, this paperextends an Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector(AOMDV) Routing protocol, named as Trust-based Secured Adhoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (TS-AOMDV), whichis based on the nodes' routing behavior. The proposed TSAOMDVaims at identifying and isolating the attacks such asflooding, black hole, and gray hole attacks in MANET. With thehelp of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and trust-based routing, attack identification and isolation are carried out in two phases ofrouting such as route discovery and data forwarding phase. IDSfacilitates complete routing security by observing both controlpackets and data packets that are involved in the routeidentification and the data forwarding phases. To improve therouting performance, the IDS integrates the measured statisticsinto the AOMDV routing protocol for the detection of attackers. This facilitates the TS-AOMDV to provide better routingperformance and security in MANET. Finally, the Trust basedSecured AOMDV, TS-AOMDV is compared with the existingAOMDV through the NS2 based simulation model. Theperformance evaluation reveals that the proposed TS-AOMDVimproves the performance in terms of throughput by 57.1%more than that of an AOMDV under adversary scenario.

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET.

CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost.

To balance the resource consumption weight based leader election model is used, which elected an optimal collection of leaders to minimize the overall resource consumption and obtaining secure communication using diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.","","978-1-4673-1037-6;9781467310376","","10.1109/ICPRIME.2012.6208348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208348","EESCP;Mobile adhoc networs;leader election;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Energy states;Lead;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","2-hop clusters;EESCP;MANET;clustering methods;cryptographic protocols;diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol;energy efficiency and secure communication protocol;intrusion detection techniques;key management schemes;leader node;mobile ad hoc networks;optimal collection;resource consumption weight based leader election model;routing management;secure communication;security attacks;topology management","","2","","14","","","21-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provide advantages such as reporting consolidated data, reducing data redundancy, improving network lifetime etc. However, deploying WSNs in hostile and remote environments presents security vulnerabilities that can lead to various security attacks such as energy based attacks, attacks on data aggregation etc. Numerous secure DA techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5;9781479967605","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.","","978-1-4673-1326-1;9781467313261","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418660","Wireless Network;classification;detection;jamming;security","Benchmark testing;Business process re-engineering;Communication system security;Jamming;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;pattern classification;radio networks","IDS framework;MAC layers;attack classification;intrusion detection system;jamming attack classification;jamming based DoS attacks;jamming detection;multiple security threats;physical layers;wireless networks;wireless transmissions","","0","","26","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

A type of wireless network, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous system of mobile nodes where a collection of mobile hosts with wireless network interfaces form a temporary network without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. The success of MANET strongly depends on its security. Security is an essential service for wireless network communications especially in mission-critical applications like military applications. A variety of attacks such as Warmhole, Blackhole, Byzantine, Rushing/Flooding, Anonymity/Location Disclosure, Denial of Service etc have been identified and some solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, existing published solutions typically concentrate on particular type of attacks and are incapable of identifying threats, which occur as a result of combination of these attacks. As overall security level is determined by the system's weakest point, a distributed security scheme that uses an integrated approach to address a combination of these attacks is very much necessary. The work in progress aims to investigate the possible combination of attacks that can be addressed by integrating some of the existing work on mobile ad hoc networks security, which addresses a portion of the security concerns individually. The analysis of attacks and existing mechanisms that would help to design an integrated approach for security services is presented in this paper.","","978-1-4673-8809-2;9781467388092","","10.1109/HMI.2016.7449197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7449197","Communication Network Security;MANET Security;Secure Routing;Security Survey","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;attacks analysis;distributed security scheme;mission-critical application;mobile ad hoc network security;mobile host collection;secure routing;wireless network communication","","","","50","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To couple the network with real world tightly, we provide a network-wide time synchronization through the introduction of abstractions for cluster and hierarchy. Generally the error of time synchronization has the tendency of being accumulated as the hop count along the synchronization path increases in multi-hop wireless sensor network. Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path. We then apply different optimal synchronization mechanisms to the cluster heads and cluster members for the sake of power efficiency through an explicit broadcast manner.

This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","1","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The security system is composed of some static monitoring nodes, a Transmote, and a home server. Static nodes with pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor and digital camera are mounted on doorframes and windows to detect intruders and send intrusion alarm messages to the home server. Transmote with PIR sensor and camera can patrol in the house for security surveillance. Transmote also can provide network repairing service when some static router nodes fail. Transmote modules and static monitoring nodes are controlled by two different wireless sensor networks. The remote house owner can get the alarm messages through Internet. Transmote can transform into I-shaped or O-shaped configuration according to different locomotion requirements. A prototype system has been implemented and some performance tests have been done. Experimental results show that the I-shaped Transmote can pass through an 8.8 cm high and 10 cm wide channel. The velocity of the I-shaped Transmote is up to 3 m/min and the maximum velocity of O-shaped Transmote is 9.3 m/min.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4799-7324-8;9781479973248","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","1","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our methodology consists of 3 steps. The first step is to model adversary behavior of capture attackers and inside attackers which can dynamically and adaptively trigger the best attack strategies while avoiding detection and eviction. The second step is to model defense behavior of defenders utilizing intrusion detection and tolerance strategies to reactively and proactively counter dynamic adversary behavior. We leverage game theory to model attack/defense dynamics with the players being the attackers/defenders, the actions being the attack/defense strategies identified, and the payoff for each outcome being related to system survivability. The 3rd and final step is to identify and apply proper solution techniques that can effectively and efficiently analyze attack/defense dynamics as modeled by game theory for guiding the creation of effective defense strategies for assuring high survivability in military MANETs. The end product is a tool that is capable of analyzing a myriad of attacker behaviors and seeing the effectiveness of countering adaptive defense strategies which incorporate attack/defense dynamics.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357514","adversary modeling;defense behavior modeling;mobile ad hoc networks;reliability;survivability","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Vehicle dynamics","game theory;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","capture attackers;game theory;inside attackers;intrusion detection;military MANET applications;military mobile ad hoc networks","","","","36","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6;9780769540566","978-1-4244-7143-0;9781424471430","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2;9781467348652","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711;21569711","978-1-4577-2027-7;9781457720277","978-1-4577-2026-0;9781457720260","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","2","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, packet analysis is provided by almost each ISP but it has a high impact in term of performance and energy consumption; this makes the choice of the optimal IDS strategy both a key and non-trivial issue. To this aim, IDS strategies have been deeply investigated in term of performance, while the assessment of the energy consumption is quite unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first attempt towards the assessment of the energy impact of security solutions.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively.

Recognizing that the smart objects in IoT are most likely human-carried or human-operated devices, we propose a scalable trust management protocol for IoT, with the emphasis on social relationships. We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.","","978-1-4673-1238-7;9781467312387","978-1-4673-1237-0;9781467312370","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263792","Internet of things;Trust management;performance analysis;social networks","Accuracy;Communities;Convergence;Internet;Protocols;Quality of service;Security","Internet;computer network reliability;computer network security;protocols;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;community-interest;cooperativeness;direct observations;false recommendation attacks;global knowledge;heterogeneous network environments;honesty;human-carried devices;human-operated devices;indirect recommendations;malicious nodes;maximum achievable performance;reliability management;scalable trust management protocol;smart objects;social encounter event;social interaction event;social relationships;trust aggregation;trust assessment accuracy;trust convergence time;trust evaluation;trust parameters;trust properties;trust-based service composition application","","1","","20","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While the recent push for a “Smart Grid” has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible impact on normal operations, while providing important security mechanisms. By doing so, we demonstrate that our proposal is a practical and efficient solution for retro-fitting security onto crucial power system devices.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007774","","Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Security;Smart grids;Substations;Universal Serial Bus","authorisation;message authentication;overlay networks;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;smart power grids;substations","authenticated access control;configuration interfaces;cyber attacks;gateway devices;insider threat mitigation;overlay network;physical overlay framework;power grid;power system devices;remote substations;retro-fitting security;security mechanisms;security monitoring;smart grid","","1","","22","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","","10.1109/TST.2015.7173452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","computer network security;peer-to-peer computing;topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","FVPATA;Fiedler nodes;Fiedler value;Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption;NS3;OLSR protocol;Puncture-Style Attacks;ad hoc network topology;collision avoidance;graph theory;health-care monitoring;optimized link state routing protocol;peer-to-peer communication;robotic agent;robust ad hoc cyberphysical network;vehicle accident;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

When compared to wired and base station-based wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider and outsider attacks. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined defense perimeter. In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","1","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on the early detection of behavioral patterns of malware families rather than the detection of malware binary signatures.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681;15228681","978-1-4673-5956-6;9781467359566","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","4","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented. NS-3 simulation platform has been used to carry out performance analysis of these hierarchical routing protocols. The performance analysis shows that the hierarchical routing protocols, TL-LEACH, 3L-LEACH and 4L-LEACH fare better than the LEACH protocol.","","978-1-4799-2571-1;9781479925711","","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779352","LEACH;WSN;energy efficiency;network lifetime","Monitoring;Protocols;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","NS-3;WSN;clock speed;computational power;energy efficiency;finite battery energy;load balancing;multilevel LEACH protocol model;network lifetime;routing protocol;sensor nodes;wireless sensor network","","6","","17","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research explores the modification of the smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. Using the results from a previous study of optimized static polling rates to create minimum and maximum thresholds, a dynamic polling rate algorithm was devised. This algorithm allowed the smart battery to gauge the network's illicit attack density and adjust its polling rate to efficiently detect attacks, while conserving battery charge life.

Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays. In a multi-hop environment, these delays are compounded and may become unacceptably large.

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected.

Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture.

In wireless image sensor networks, some monitoring quality loss may be tolerated since visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevance for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes. We simulated different communication scenarios to show the expected energy saving when the proposed solution is employed.","","978-1-4577-1724-6;9781457717246","","10.1109/SAS.2012.6166274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166274","Energy-Efficient Monitoring;Sensing Relevance;Wireless Image Sensor Networks","Energy consumption;Image sensors;Monitoring;Sensors;Visualization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;image sensors;wireless sensor networks","energy efficient;image snapshots;image transmissions;sensing relevancies;source nodes;visual monitoring;wireless image sensor networks","","2","","16","","","7-9 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer.

The countermeasures against the BDI are also summarized from the views of cyber-orientation, physical-orientation. Finally, our work on cyber-physical fusion detection is presented.","2157-4839;21574839","","","10.1109/APPEEC.2013.6837157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6837157","bad data injection;cyber-physical fusion;security;smart grid","Authentication;Communication networks;Power measurement;Smart grids;Transmission line measurements","power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power system security;smart power grids","BDI attack;bad data injection attack;cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical fusion detection;device breakdown;energy distribution process;false power generation dispatch;smart grid","","5","","41","","","8-11 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3;9781479938353","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework.

The IP-based smart metering devices may exist with unknown vulnerabilities that can introduce backdoors to enable worm propagation across AMI network. The infected devices can be attack agents that would largely disable the metering functionalities or manipulate control variables of each meter. This paper proposes an optimal frequency of on-site investigation and the number of monitoring verification to investigate potential anomalies of malware footprinting by applying the decision process framework of Markovian. The proposed method determines the best inspection strategies based on the observation from the existing anomaly detectors deployed in the network. The considerations include malware propagation characteristics, accuracy of anomaly detectors, and investigation and diagnosis costs.

The proposal is specified as the IEEE 802.11s amendment. Although the IEEE802.11s amendment is still a draft, some implementations based on it may already be found. The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism. The step by step explanation of the mesh mechanisms highlights how some of the design choices may impact on the scalability and reliability of such networks.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.040210.00037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473885","HWMP;IEEE 802.11s;MANETS;multihop wireless networks;wireless mesh networks","Mesh networks;Portable computers;Scalability;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Tutorials;Wireless LAN;Wireless mesh networks","Tutorials;telecommunication network reliability;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks","IEEE 802.11s;MAC addresses;OLPC;layer-2 multihop communication;mesh mechanisms;multihop MAC;one laptop per child;path discovery mechanism;reliability;scalability;wireless local area networks standard;wireless mesh capabilities","","16","","50","","2010-05-27","First Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","1530-0889;15300889","0-7695-2855-4;0769528554","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","7","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.","1063-6404;10636404","978-1-4244-2657-7;9781424426577","978-1-4244-2658-4;9781424426584","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855","","Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory","","2","","25","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed.

Several tasks, involving an extensive sample set of over 100,000 classifications, are evaluated for speed and accuracy against the same suite running on both an Intel Core i7-2600 system with lib SVM and an Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU. Our promising results show that our architecture is able to achieve a measure able speed increase in performance of up to 53x while matching 99.95% of all lib SVM predictions.","","","","10.1109/FCCM.2015.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160083","embedded design;field prgrammable gate arrays;parallel architectures;support vector machines","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Hardware;Kernel;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Support vector machines","embedded systems;graphics processing units;pattern classification;reconfigurable architectures;support vector machines","Intel Core i7-2600 system;Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU;classification processing;graphics processing unit;lib SVM predictions;multiclass SVM classification;realtime embedded systems classification;reconfigurable hardware architecture;reconfigurable multiclass support vector machine","","0","","21","","","2-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1;9781479939251","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensors have become an excellent tool for military applications involving intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, information gathering and smart logistics support in an unknown deployed area. Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out. Our IDS is simple to employ, requires minimal processing and data storage. Experimental scenarios are presented as verification of its functionality and practicality.","","0-7803-8140-8;0780381408","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290173","","Communication system security;Control systems;Information security;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Monitoring;Protocols;Stochastic systems;Wireless sensor networks","hidden Markov models;military communication;protocols;wireless sensor networks","data storage;deployment region;hidden Markov model;information gathering;intrusion detection system;military applications;minimal processing;perimeter monitoring;resource-constrained devices;security control;smart logistics;stochastic learning;wireless sensor networks","","24","","8","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated. It can also handle repetition of both single and multi-symbol sub-expressions.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673707","","","computer network security;digital signatures;finite automata;symbol manipulation","Glushkov nondeterministic flnite automata;NFA;NIDS;NIDS rule sets;attack signatures;bit-parallel architecture;constrained repetitions;deep packet inspection;hardware acceleration;multisymbol subexpressions;network intrusion detection systems;regular expression repetitions;standard BP system","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers. Constructing fewer features can also improve the efficiency of network intrusion detection.","1751-8709;17518709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2014.0353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295682","","","computer network security;decision trees;feature selection","BN;Bayesian networks;C4.5 classifiers;IG;attack detection accuracy;decision trees;distributed denial-of-service attacks;feature selection schemes;high speed network intrusion detection;information gain;lightweight intrusion detection;massive data;massive network traffic","","","","","","","11 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","2","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

"HIDS: Honesty-Rate Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection System for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks","P. Sen; N. Chaki; R. Chaki","Asansol Eng.

CISIM '08. 7th","20080709","2008","","","121","126","In this paper, a new honest-rate base collaborative intrusion detection system (HIDS) has been proposed for mobile, ad-hoc networks. The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection. The h-rate may also be used for secure routing in MANET.","","978-0-7695-3184-7;9780769531847","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557846","IDS;MANET;attacks;collaborative decision making;neighborhood watch;private key","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data","MANET;collaborative decision making;collaborative intrusion detection system;honesty-rate;mobile ad-hoc networks;multiple threshold values;packet forwarding;phantom intrusion detection;rule-based scheme","","4","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","38","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud computing platform, virtual servers, and the provider's services are highly dynamic and diverse in nature, making the traditional access control mechanisms (e.g., Firewalls and VLAN etc.) less effective in controlling the unauthorized access to cloud's data and resources. Several access control policies and authorization system have been proposed in literature to defend against cloud security threats. Most of these systems are designed to work with one or more access control policies. However, little work has been done to develop generic access control architecture capable to work with most of the available access control policies. In this paper, we present a new access control architecture using a global resource management system (GRMS) to effectively handle both local and remote access requests. The introduction of GRMS makes our proposed architecture semi distributed at the expense of minimal request-response time.

The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter.

Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950;08858950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","6","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But the properties of constrained resources make WSNs vulnerable to different types of intrusions such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which result in a large number of compromised nodes. For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes. Finally, the system is analyzed and verified. The simulation results indicate that the compromised nodes can self-recover effectively and network total energy consumption also is reduced effectively.","","","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2013.6823943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823943","DoS attacks;Intrusion detection;Sef-recovery;Wireless sensor networks","Computer crime;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;software agents;wireless sensor networks","agent based intrusion detection;denial of service attacks;network total energy consumption;self-recovery system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sensor network is considered to be heterogeneous. It uses a PIR sensor for movement detection, an RFID sensor for identifying the person and an image sensor for verification. This system uses both wired and wireless networks for efficient data transfer. Data from either networks are synchronised using time and location information.

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X;1550445X","978-1-4244-6695-5;9781424466955","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","6","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4673-1796-2;9781467317962","978-0-7695-4713-8;9780769547138","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","6","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many-to-one communication the adversary attracts its surrounding neighbor nodes with false routing information and fake identities. The existing researches have focused on single layer attacks. In their work they target only one specific layer and detect the attack, without considering other layers into account. Our proposed detection technique maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross layer features and Mobile agent based approach in two phases. In first phase, attacks are detected by correlating the cross layer features such as MAC and Network layers. During second phase, if the attacks are detected, mobile agent based technique is applied to prevent the attack. Here the data is forwarded through the mobile agent. The mobile agent solves the security problem by using three step negotiations. Through this mobile agent based approach, the false positive rate can be reduced and improving the energy efficiency than the existing approach.","","","","10.1109/ICICES.2016.7518935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7518935","Cross layer;Mobile agent;Security;Sinkhole attack;Sybil attack","Base stations;Cross layer design;Feature extraction;Mobile agents;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","25-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EEG signals capture important information pertinent to different physiological brain states. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for evaluating the power-accuracy trade-off for EEG-based compressive sensing and classification techniques in the context of epileptic seizure detection in wireless tele-monitoring. The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value. The satisfying results demonstrate the effect of efficient compression on maximizing the sensor lifetime without affecting the application's accuracy.","2376-6492;23766492","978-1-4673-2479-3;9781467324793","","10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583564","DCT;EEG;classification;compressive sensing;feature extraction;wavelet compression","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Discrete cosine transforms;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;discrete cosine transforms;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;performance evaluation;radio networks","DCT;EEG signals;EEG-based epileptic seizure detection;brain electric activities;compression-accuracy trade-off;compressive sensing;daubechie wavelet;discrete cosine transform;electroencephalogram signals;energy-efficient compression;noisy wireless communication channel;performance evaluation;wireless telemonitoring","","1","","27","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","2324-898X;2324898X","978-1-4673-2172-3;9781467321723","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","1","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These types of WSN rely on cluster heads for data aggregation and transmission towards sink node. Subsequently cluster head nodes are outfitted with high energy. Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8;9781479998548","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns.

The focus is on the real-time dynamic and optimal deployment of the network for detecting untrackable targets. The dynamic nature of the deployment refers to the on-line reconfigurability of the network as real-time information about the target becomes available. The optimal locations of the network nodes, in turn, are determined based on maximizing the probability of finding the target through the use of iso-cumulative-probability curves. The proposed strategy is adaptable to unstructured environments with natural terrain variation and the presence of obstacles. Extensive simulations, some of which are included in this paper, verified the advantage of our deployment strategy over other existing methods. Namely, the proposed strategy can tangibly increase the success rate of target detection, while reducing the mean detection time, when compared with uniform-coverage-based approaches that do not consider probabilistic target-motion modeling. A comprehensive example is also included, herein, to illustrate the successful application of our proposed deployment strategy to a wilderness search and rescue scenario, where both static and mobile sensors are employed within a hybrid sensor-deployment strategy.","1530-437X;1530437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2537331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423661","Static-sensor networks;mobile-target detection;optimal deployment","Genetic algorithms;Mobile communication;Probabilistic logic;Real-time systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Target tracking","object detection;sensors","dynamic approach;expanding search areas;mobile-target detection;natural terrain variation;on-line reconfigurability;sensor network deployment;static-sensor network;unstructured search areas","","","","63","","2016-03-02","June1, 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS.

Open medium, wide distribution and de-centralization of nodes makes MANETs vulnerable and malicious. It is crucial to develop efficient intrusion detection system to protect MANETs. A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism.

Since this process is tightly coupled with the used hiding method, its detection is a challenging task, also worsened by the very low transmission rates. As a consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy consumed by the device. In this perspective, this paper aims to spot malware covertly exchanging data using two detection methods based on artificial intelligence tools, such as neural networks and decision trees.

Sensor nodes play a important role in alerting us any distinct changes that occur in the sited area and is prone to innumerous attacks. These attacks damage trust with the received data from a sensor node. One such type of attack is the false data injection attack. The message is forged by the adversary, not detected by the forwarding nodes as false information. Compromised node is the origin of false data to be injected in to the WSN. The proposed work discards the false data injected message from the network. This issue of compromised node is handled by the detection and elimination of it from causing further damage to the network by incorporating Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) technique for data authentication to any message received. A node involved in sensing requires a high range of sensing power. But sensor nodes have limited energy and this is a battle for all technicians in creating any inventions that suits this constraint.

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","978-1-4244-7628-2;9781424476282","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore security in Wireless Sensor Network WSNs is challenging and critical to the functionality of the networked sensors. This is very important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is known for limitations on hardware and software and for resources-constrained in general.

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6;9781467315906","978-1-4673-1589-0;9781467315890","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","1551-6245;15516245","978-1-4244-4153-2;9781424441532","978-0-7695-3650-7;9780769536507","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","10","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes.

Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

BEMSs control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems in buildings; more specifically, they control HVAC's primary components such as air handling units (AHUs), chillers, and heating elements. BEMSs are essential components of modern buildings, tasked with seemingly contradicting requirements?minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupants? comfort [1]. In the United States, about 40% of total energy consumption and 70% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings every year. These numbers are comparable to global statistics that about 30% of total energy consumption and 60% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings. Buildings are an integral part of global cyber-physical systems (smart cities) and evolve and interact with their surroundings. As buildings undergo years of exploitation, their thermal characteristics deteriorate, indoor spaces (especially in commercial buildings) get rearranged, and usage patterns change. In time, their inner (and outer) microclimates adjust to changes in surrounding buildings, overshadowing patterns, and city climates, not to mention building retrofitting. Thus, even in cases of ideally designed BEMS/HVAC systems, because of ever-changing and uncertain indoor and outdoor environments, their performance frequently falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, the complexity of BEMSs, large amounts of constantly changing data, and evolving interrelations among sensor feeds make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. Therefore, traditional data-mining algorithms and data-analysis tools are often inadequate.This article provides an overview of issues related to modern BEMSs with a multitude of (often con- licting) requirements. Because of massive and often incomplete data sets, control, sensing, and the evolving nature of these complex systems, computational intelligence (CI) techniques present a natural solution to optimal energy efficiency, energy security, and occupant comfort in buildings. The article further presents an overall architecture where CI can be used in BEMSs and concludes with a case study of the practical applications of using CI techniques in the BEMS domain.","1932-4529;19324529","","","10.1109/MIE.2015.2513749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436878","","Adaptation models;Buildings;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Resilience;Security;Smart grids","building management systems;energy management systems","HVAC system;access control;adaptive buildings;building automation systems;building control systems;building energy management systems;computational intelligence;fire safety;intelligent buildings;life safety;lighting system;physical security","","","","","","","Spring 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In flat topology, the nodes relay every data item collected by each node towards the gateway node, thereby draining the energy of the relaying nodes soon. In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes. Using hierarchical topology, the data is collected from the nodes in the near vicinity and the same is aggregated and these aggregate values are sent to the gateway node.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0;9781479933570","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","2155-6806;21556806","978-1-4244-5113-5;9781424451135","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, the security measures applied in MANETs (like encryption and key distribution) have a number of negative effects on the network's performance. Cryptographic operations introduce a lot of both CPU and communication overhead. Therefore, routing protocols improvement is a challenge for researchers to overcome the negative effects of security measures. Clustering the MANET is a known technique to lower the routing over-head. It can also be utilized to distribute encryption keys and the authentication process. In this paper, a new protocol called Secure Clustering and Energy Saver Protocol “SCESP” is proposed. SCESP secures the Mobile Ad hoc Networks and increase its network lifetime. This system introduces a novel self-node clustering technique based on Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector “AODV” routing protocol. In addition, it eliminates the key distribution overhead using smart token or similar hardware which is used for authentication.

The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More number of heterogeneous networks are created and deployed by government as well as by private firms. Due to the distance, mobility, behavior of nodes in the networks and dynamic in nature, it is essential to provide security for all the networks separately or distributed. Various existing approaches discuss about the security issues and challenges for heterogeneous networks. In this paper a Leader Based Intrusion Detection System [LBIDS] is proposed to detect and prevent DOS as well as other attacks such as Sybil and Sinkhole in the networks by deploying the Leader Based Intrusion Detection System into access points in the networks. The proposed approach utilizes three core security challenges such as Authentication, positive incentive provision and preventing DOS. In addition to that it will do packet verification and IP verification for improving the efficiency in terms of detection and prevention against attacks in heterogeneous networks. The simulation of our proposed approach is carried out in NS2 software and the results were given.","","","","10.1109/IBSS.2015.7456671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456671","Heterogeneous Networks;Intrusion Detection System;Leader Based Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Sensor Network","Authentication;Heterogeneous networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","DOS prevention;IP verification;LBIDS;NS2 software;Sinkhole;Sybil;access points;authentication;data transmission;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intruder prevention;leader based intrusion detection system;packet verification;positive incentive provision;private firms","","","","18","","","10-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main goal of this paper is to reduce the huge volume of management tasks inherent to this type of network services, as well as facilitating the design of DIDS whose managing complexity could be restricted within well-defined margins.

"A Moderate to Robust Game Theoretical Model for Intrusion Detection in MANETs","H. Otrok; N. Mohammed; L. Wang; M. Debbabi; P. Bhattacharya","Concordia Inst. for Inf. Syst. Eng., Concordia Univ., Montreal, QC","2008 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications","20081021","2008","","","608","612","One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.","2160-4886;21604886","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","978-0-7695-3393-3;9780769533933","10.1109/WiMob.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307","Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election","Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security","Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption","","2","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming. In the numerical experiments, we point out that the payoff of the secondary users increases with the number of available jamming-free channels and is eventually limited by the behavior of primary users.","1550-3607;15503607","978-1-4244-6402-9;9781424464029","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502451","","Cognitive radio;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Emulation;Frequency;Jamming;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","Markov processes;cognitive radio;jamming;stochastic games;wireless channels","Markovian game model;antijamming scenario;jamming-free channels;multichannel cognitive radio systems;stochastic zero-sum game model;zero-sum interactions","","14","","20","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node. These results show that the lifespan of sensor network increases and average energy consumed by sensor node decreases.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781305","Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Attack;Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media access Control Protocol (FSMAC);Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol;Security Issues;Wireless Sensor Networks","Frequency division multiaccess;Indexes;Protocols;Receivers;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;cryptographic protocols;decision making;energy consumption;fuzzy logic;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DOS attack;FSMAC protocol;WSN improvement;decision making;denial of service;energy consumption;fuzzy logic secure media access control protocol;human reasoning;intrusion detector parameter;multiple access networks;sensor nodes;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them.

Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%.

Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8;9781595930828","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies.

We model the communication scenario between the smart meter and in-home appliances as a heterogeneous multiuser network. The optimal power-allocation algorithm is developed under the constraints that 1) each user satisfies individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement for successful heterogeneous communication, 2) the sum of transmit power allocated to each user is equal to the permissible total transmit power at the smart meter, and 3) the allocated transmit power to each user is feasible. The optimization problem is mathematically shown to be convex, and the optimal power allocation is thus derived. By employing the theorem that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables follows Erlang distribution, the probability distribution function (pdf) of the smallest allocated transmit power is mathematically obtained from the properties of downlink indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channels. It is analytically shown that the allocated transmit power has a lower limit, which is determined by the SINR threshold and the total number of active users in the HAN. Furthermore, numerical results verify the capacity performance improvements of the proposed optimal power-allocation scheme.

Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control.

The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used. The results obtained so far support the feasibility of our method.","","978-1-4799-6363-8;9781479963638","","10.1109/JISIC.2014.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975566","Machine learning;Mobile phone security;Multi-label classification;Trusted measurement","Battery charge measurement;Global Positioning System;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile handsets;Monitoring;Power demand;Power measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);smart phones;telecommunication security;trusted computing","machine learning multilabel classification algorithms;malicious program;mobile phones;power consumption measurements;sensitive activities;software monitors;trusted detection","","0","","23","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate. Our simulations have shown that the network observability and detection accuracy can be improved by means of grid-placed sensor deployment.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2274043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563147","Smart grid;cyber-physical security;energy theft;false data injection attack;intrusion detection;observability;sensor placement;state estimation","Current measurement;Energy management;Network security;Network topology;Power measurement;Real-time systems;Sensors;Smart grids;Smart meters;State estimation","power distribution protection;safety systems;sensor placement;smart meters;smart power grids","CONSUMER attack model;FDI;coin change problems;combination sum of energy profiles attack;electricity bills;energy consumption reading;energy theft;false data injection;grid sensor placement algorithm;hybrid detection framework;observability analysis;physical attack;power distribution systems;real-time communications;smart meters","","4","","51","","2013-07-18","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","4","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds.

Recent studies, demonstrate that such attacks can be very easily accomplished using off-the-shelf equipment. To give a simple example, a malicious node can continually transmit a radio signal in order to block any legitimate access to the medium and/or interfere with reception. This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used.

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.","","978-1-4799-8827-3;9781479988273","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467","Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time","","0","","17","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded, however, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance, which can be degraded by many factors, such as low data rates, delays in wireless paths, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments, i.e., it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation.

This paper presents a technique called as ZIDS i.e. Zonal-based Intrusion Detection System that uses potential of game theory in order to extracts the uncertain strategies of the malicious node.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7;9781424491537","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.","1524-4547;15244547","","","10.1109/WETICE.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927063","Indistinguability;Nonmalleability;Secure Scheduling;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Context;Generators;Scheduling;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","communication costs nodes;network lifetime;protocols;quality of service;resource constraints;resource preservation requirement;secure communication infrastructure;secure nodes scheduling algorithm;security framework;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the use of SDN as an approach to assist in the modernization of SCADA systems. We discuss its possible benefits, such as simplified management of power system resources. Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components. The mechanism was implemented as an SDN-based application for SCADA systems that uses multipath routing, which relies on SDN features to frequently modify communication routes between SCADA devices. Further, we performed an experimental evaluation to verify the impact and performance of the mechanism in the SCADA network.","1573-0077;15730077","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140289","","Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Routing;SCADA systems;Substations","SCADA systems;power system management;smart power grids;software defined networking;substations;telecommunication network routing","ICT;SCADA components;SCADA devices;SCADA network performance;SDN-based SCADA systems;communication flows;communication routes;electric system;electricity distribution;electricity transmission;field devices;information and communication technology;multipath routing;network applications;power grids;power system resources management;smart grids;software-defined networking;substations management;substations monitoring;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","31","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","18","1","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of our knowledge, effective countermeasures for potential reliability issues in the hardware implementations of this algorithm have not been presented to date. In proposing the error detection approach, our aim is to have acceptable complexity and performance overheads while maintaining high error coverage. In this regard, we present a low-complexity recomputing with rotated operands-based scheme which is a step-forward toward reducing the hardware overhead of the proposed error detection approach. Moreover, we perform injection-based fault simulations and show that the error coverage of close to 100% is derived. Furthermore, we have designed the proposed scheme and through ASIC analysis, it is shown that acceptable complexity and performance overheads are reached.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission.

ERESS is based on Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) and aims to reduce the number of victims in panic-type disasters. This system consists of new mobile terminals (handset size) with advanced disaster recognition algorithm and acquires sensor information such as acceleration, direction difference and walking steps. Collected information about them is used for detecting the occurrence of a disaster. However, until now, there is no suitable information spreading method for ERESS to collect their information effectively. In this paper we propose three information spreading methods which are suitable for ERESS.

The goal is to build a framework that exposes tools and methods for a centralized processing of IEEE 802.11 frames. In our architecture all management tasks, including beaconing, client authentication and association, are performed by the central controller instead of the distributed wireless access points as in traditional networks. The generated frames are tunneled to lightweight wireless access points (APs) or thin APs that perform the media access and radio frequency (RF) conversion. Agents executed on thin APs allow scheduling of simple tasks like traffic filtering for local execution. Additionally, the agents provide functions found in modern WLAN chipsets, such as precise frame transmit timings or RF spectrum analysis to the controller. Our architecture allows to delegate computationally intensive tasks to a central instance with enough processing power. Thus, it is best suited for devices with limited resources that we use as thin APs. We present applications that can be built using our framework, e.g., client geolocalization or energy consumption optimization. Finally we evaluate the performance of our architecture in a testbed using COTS devices with open-source software.","","","","10.1109/NETSOFT.2016.7502421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502421","","Communication system security;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Media Access Protocol;Metadata;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;public domain software;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","COTS devices;IEEE 802.11 frames;RADIator;RF spectrum analysis;WLAN chipsets;beaconing;client authentication;client geolocalization;controllable wireless networks;energy consumption optimization;enterprise wireless local area networks;lightweight wireless access points;management tasks;media access conversion;open-source software;precise frame transmit timings;radio frequency conversion;simple task scheduling;software-defined networking architecture;thin AP;traffic filtering","","","","21","","","6-10 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is absolutely necessary to use algorithmic models to defend against these threats. However, all models are sensitive to deviation from the original contexts in which the models were developed. Hence, it is not really an overstatement to say that `all models are wrong'. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics loop for supporting the continuous development of models during their deployment. We describe the roles of three types of operators (monitors, analysts and modelers), present the visualization techniques used at different stages of model development, and demonstrate the utility of this approach in conjunction with a prototype software system for corporate insider threat detection.

Sci., California Univ., Berkeley, CA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","20061002","2006","24","10","1805","1816","New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multimatch packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption","0733-8716;07338716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613","Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce","content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security","SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","12","","32","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied. They are designed and simulated in VHDL using Modelsim tool.","","978-1-4244-4789-3;9781424447893","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204400","Field programmable gate array;Hash;Network intrusion detection System;payload scanning","Communication system traffic control;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;string matching;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;Modelsim tool;VHDL;Word Split Hash algorithm;content-based security threats;hardware based pattern matching;hash based algorithm;high speed network;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet header;packet inspection;packet payload;payload scanning;string matching algorithm;virus detection","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we analyze the confidentiality of information in the AMI consisting of nodes with interdependent correlated security assets. On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI. Using our model, we derive the minimum defense resources required and the optimal strategy of the defender.

Low Energy Aware Cluster Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in WSN that consumes limited energy; thus increases the network lifetime. The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold.

This paper addresses that challenge through two main contributions. First, we introduce and classify an extended set of AMI-specific cyber incident response actions.

Network performance is evaluated in terms of normalized throughput, routing overhead, normalized routing load, and average packet delay, when a percentage of nodes misbehave. Simulation results show that although the performance of all three routing protocols degrades, DSDV is the most robust routing protocol under security attacks.

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918856","digital world;electronic circuit;rough set","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Electronic circuits;Logic gates;Set theory","logic gates;rough set theory","artificial intelligence based approach;circuit miniaturization;decision rules;electronic circuit;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is energy inefficient because all nodes have to receive and forward the alarm packet so as to exhaust communication bandwidth and node energy, especially when there are a large number of sensor nodes in the network. This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack. The paper analyzes the overhead cost of the green firewall and compare it with the flooding broadcast method. Extensive analysis and simulations show that green firewall can prevent the attack and effectively reduce redundant alarm packet transmissions which results in less energy consumption.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4673-0920-2;9781467309202","978-1-4673-0919-6;9781467309196","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503580","","","energy conservation;energy consumption;firewalls;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IDS;WSN;communication bandwidth;energy consumption;energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism;green firewall;intrusion detection system;mobile intruder;redundant alarm packet transmission;security attack;sensor node energy;vulnerablity;wireless sensor network","","4","","22","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper tries to address these issues of security considering the fact of limited availability of resources like power, bandwidth, thereby helping to achieve, more secure and time-efficient system in place for the effective online health monitoring scheme using WBAN. Also the security system for WBAN is proposed with low computational complexity for the secure transaction using a key utilized cryptographic encryption algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2353-3;9781479923533","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921738","Authentication;Encryption;Key Exchange;Security","Authentication;Body area networks;Encryption;Monitoring;Servers","body area networks;medical computing;private key cryptography","WBAN;configuration time;cryptographic encryption algorithm;secure data authentication model;secure data exchange;security parameters;single private key;wireless body area network","","0","","12","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions. To these ends the Session Aggregation for Network Traffic Analysis (SANTA) dataset is proposed.

However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8;0780386868","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

In this paper we propose a hierarchical energy efficient intrusion detection system, to protect sensor network from black hole attacks.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4;9781479930784","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","1","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory.

Foreseen applications include safety applications, traffic efficiency enhancements, and infotainment services. To make future deployment successful, it is imperative that all applications are matched with proper security mechanisms. Current proposals mostly focus on entity authorization by establishing a public key infrastructure. Such proactive security efficiently excludes nonauthorized entities from the network. However, in the face of insider attackers possessing valid key material, we need to consider data-centric methods to complement entity-centric trust. A promising approach for consistency checks, particularly in multihop scenarios, is to exploit redundant information dissemination. If information is received from both honest and malicious vehicles, chances are that attacks can be detected. In this paper, we propose three graph-based metrics to gauge the redundancy of dissemination protocols. We apply our metrics to a baseline protocol, a geocast protocol, and an aggregation protocol using extensive simulations. In addition, we point out open issues and applications of the metrics, such as colluding attackers and eviction of attacker nodes based on detected attacks. Results show that Advanced Adaptive Geocast behaves almost optimally from a routing efficiency point of view but fails to offer sufficient redundancy for data consistency mechanisms in many scenarios. The simulated aggregation protocol shows sufficient redundancy to facilitate data consistency checking.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2236117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392305","Data consistency;graph theory;protocol analysis;vehicular networks (VANETs)","Bandwidth;Measurement;Protocols;Redundancy;Safety;Sensors;Vehicles","data integrity;graph theory;information dissemination;protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET multihop data dissemination protocols;aggregation protocol;attacker node eviction;colluding attackers;consistency checks;data consistency checking;data-centric methods;entity authorization;entity-centric trust;geocast protocol;graph-based metrics;honest vehicles;infotainment services;insider attack detection;malicious vehicles;public key infrastructure;redundant information dissemination;safety applications;security mechanisms;traffic efficiency enhancements;vehicular networks","","3","","31","","2012-12-21","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we study pipeline sharing, such that a single pipeline can be used to serve several packet types. Pipeline sharing decreases the needed total number of cores, but typically increases pipeline lengths and therefore packet delays. We consider two novel optimization problems of allocating cores between different packet types such that the average or the worst-case delay is minimized. We study the two problems and suggest optimal algorithms that apply under different assumptions on the input. We also present greedy algorithms for the general case. Last, we examine our solutions on synthetic examples as well as on real-life applications and demonstrate that they often achieve close-to-optimal delays.","1045-9219;10459219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2556670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457328","Multicore Optimization;Network Function Virtualization;Network Processors","Delays;Multicore processing;Pipeline processing;Pipelines;Program processors;Virtualization","","","","","","","","2016-04-20","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It is hard to find an IP packet that has not passed over an Ethernet segment. One important reason for this is Ethernet's simplicity and ease of configuration. However, Ethernet has always been known to be an insecure technology. Recent successful malware attacks and the move towards cloud computing in data centers demand that attention be paid to the security aspects of Ethernet. In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes. However, none of the above provides the perfect combination of simplicity and security befitting Ethernet.","1553-877X;1553877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2012.121112.00190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407456","Data security;Ethernet networks;Security","IP networks;Local area networks;Ports (Computers);Routing protocols;Security;Switches","IP networks;cryptography;firewalls;invasive software;local area networks;protocols","Ethernet LAN security;Ethernet segment;IP packet;address resolution protocol;centralized cryptography;cloud computing;data centers;firewalls;malware attacks","","0","","82","","2013-01-09","Third Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we present a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN, CUKNN, using CUDA multi-thread model, where the data elements are processed in a data-parallel fashion. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of the GPU.

In this paper, an efficient intrusion detection model is introduced. The model uses intelligent techniques to detect intrusions. Two different architectures are introduced. The first architecture represents the level of sensor node, sink node, and base station. The second architecture represents the levels of sensor and sink nodes. This work proposes two intrusion detection algorithms, one uses a supervised learning mechanism to be used on the level of the sensor node and the other uses an unsupervised learning mechanism to be used on the levels of both the sink node and base station. The output of the algorithms is a set of detection rules which are structured in the form of binary tree. The introduced algorithms provided a high detection accuracy using less number of selected features, compared to previous work for intrusion detection, which decreases the complexity and the processing time. The proposed learning algorithms used only 10% of the data for training. An enhancement for J48 classification algorithm is also introduced which decreases the size of the algorithm's decision tree and makes it suitable to be used for intrusion detection in WSNs.","","978-1-4799-8660-6;9781479986606","","10.1109/NGMAST.2015.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373249","Classification;Clustering;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks Security;feature selection","Base stations;Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Unsupervised learning;Wireless sensor networks","decision trees;security of data;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","J48 classification algorithm;base station;binary tree;decision tree;distributed intrusion detection system;intelligent techniques;sensor node;sink node;unsupervised learning mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development of cost-efficient algorithms to address these types of non-technical losses also targets the reduction of commercial losses because the full protection of an information system is very expensive. Thus, this work proposes a strategy to detect non-technical losses using a multivariate control chart that establishes a reliable region for monitoring the measured variance. After the detection of non-technical losses, a pathfinding procedure based on the A-Star algorithm is able to locate the consumption point with the non-technical loss. Moreover, a geographical information system application displays the consumption point that is the target of the cyber-attack.

The resource-constraint characteristics of WSNs limit the secure design and development of security protocols and presumably thwart the integration of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Whilst, sensor nodes which usually operate in unattended and even harsh environments, are prone to failures and vulnerable to malicious attacks. For reliable and secure communications in WSNs, intrusion-tolerant routing becomes possibly a critical attribute that should be integrated into WSNs. However, there was not much research investigated on this topic. In order to provide a useful starting point for researchers interested in the subject, in this paper, we comparatively study two intrusion-tolerant routing protocols for WSNs, namely INSENS and ITSRP. Simulations were especially invested to assess their practicality. We also propose some suggestions to improve these two protocols. Although the feasibility of our suggestions is still questionable and deserves more investigation, we consider this study as the first step to fulfill the design of intrusion-tolerant WSNs as well as to build a complete intrusion-tolerant framework hereafter.","","978-1-4673-8314-1;9781467383141","","10.1109/BWCCA.2015.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424793","Attack tolerance;Intrusion-tolerance;Performance Evaluation;Routing;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","IDS;INSENS routing protocols;ITSRP routing protocols;WSN;communication reliability;intrusion detection system;intrusion-tolerant routing protocols;malicious attack vulnerability;resource-constraint characteristics;secure communications;security protocol development;wireless sensor networks","","","","20","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As it is a communications less and source limit network, it is very important to propose secure based energy efficient routing protocol. In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature. It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node. The advantage of the proposed routing protocol is that it increases privacy of the message as well as it maintains the energy efficiency of the node.","","978-1-4799-4191-9;9781479941919","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992982","AdHoc;Group Signature;Manet;PPSEER;PRISM","Ad hoc networks;Energy efficiency;Privacy;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","ad hoc network;encryption;group signature;maximum transmission power;network node;privacy protecting secure;recipient node;secret key;secure parameter;security based energy efficient routing protocol;sender node;underlying routing protocol","","0","","11","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886;21604886","978-1-4673-1429-9;9781467314299","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","4","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography).

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9;9781467357869","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we focus on the security of a small remote-controlled robotic vehicle. Having observed that certain types of cyber attacks against it exhibit physical impact, we have developed an intrusion detection system that takes into account not only cyber input features, such as network traffic and disk data, but also physical input features, such as speed, physical jittering and power consumption. As the system is resource-restricted, we have opted for a decision tree-based approach for generating simple detection rules, which we evaluate against denial of service and command injection attacks.

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","1934-5070;19345070","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, securing IoT technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection for low-resource IoT devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e. high detection and low false positive rates).","","","","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510811","Anomaly detection;Game theory;Low-resources devices;Nash equilibrium","Energy consumption;Games;Handwriting recognition;Internet of things;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cryptography;digital signatures;energy consumption;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;Internet of Things;Nash equilibrium;attack confirmation;attack pattern detection;cryptography;energy consumption;game-theoretic methodology;intrusion detection system;learning algorithm;lightweight anomaly detection technique;low-resource IoT devices;signature detection","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511;15253511","978-1-4244-1997-5;9781424419975","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","7","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the unique properties of cloud computing security, it proposes a secure management scheme in cloud computing. This scheme is used to detect the hacker attacks, illegal operation, potential threats and other security events in time based on big data. There are three main sections in the scheme: vulnerability scan, system log collection, correlation analysis. They are simply introduced and analyzed in this paper. Vulnerability scan: regular using of Nikto, Sandcat or other security tools for the cloud system to carry out the vulnerability scanning, regular network security self-testing, and building an extremely detailed scan report. System log collection: Using of Splunk, Nagios or other tools to collect the system log, also building a detailed log report. Correlation analysis: through the correlation analysis or canonical correlation analysis is used on the system log reports and vulnerability scanning reports, the attacker's attack will be found and the system will be issued a warning in time.

The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack.

In this paper we describe a method for security self-adaptation tailed for wireless sensor networks. This method allows devices to adapt security of applications gradually with the goal of guaranteeing the maximum possible level of security while satisfying power constraints.

While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time. The proposed research work uses biological inspirations and machine learning techniques for adding security against such threats.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","1","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is no centralized network. There are various attacks for which defend mechanism have been proposed by many researchers. Out of all such attacks wormhole attack poses a great threat as it has ability to grab the route more easily and is difficult to prevent. This paper basically focuses on wormhole attack and proposes an efficient detection and prevention method for this type of attack in AODV protocol using trust based mechanism. The method uses multi-paths for the path discovery process and thus provides greater path selection. The proposed method works by observing the routing path and the path that exceeds the threshold value are considered as wormhole link and the nodes on that link are identified as wormhole nodes. After detection of wormhole attack, for sending data packet from source to destination node we prefer multiple paths by which efficiency of network increases and packet delay as well as packet drop minimizes to great extent.

The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem. Numerical results show that the performance of multiuser selection scheme in HANs of smart grid is due to several factors, i.e., total number of devices in HANs, traffic intensity, modulation scheme, and multiuser interference cancellation coefficient, etc.","1949-3053;19493053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457436","Bit error rate (BER);home area networks (HANs);multiuser interference (MUI);multiuser selection;outage probability;smart grid","Bit error rate;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Interference;Modulation;Random variables;Signal to noise ratio;Smart grids","error statistics;home networks;interference suppression;log normal distribution;multiuser channels;probability;radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;radiotelemetry;smart meters;smart power grids","BER;HAN;MUI;PDF;S-V model;SINR;SNR;amplitude distribution property;bit error rate;classic indoor Saleh-Valen- zuela channel;closed-form capacity outage probability;dynamic home area networks;fading effects;free space path loss;log-normal shadowing;modulation scheme;multiuser interference cancellation coefficient;multiuser selection scheme;probability density func- tion;signal to noise ratio;smart grid communications;smart meter;traffic intensity","","3","","23","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method.

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537;19324537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","47","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","1-4244-0423-1;1424404231","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level. The simulation using SystemC with NoC modeled as Cycle-Accurate showed that an average throughput of 2.20 Gbps and latency of 0.025 cycle/flit were achieved while computing the matrix multiplication of size 112×92 with 81 Processing Element (PE) organize as 9×9 while running with clock speed of 100 MHz.","","978-1-4673-1156-4;9781467311564","978-1-4673-1155-7;9781467311557","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381018","2D Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA);Homogeneous Processor;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Parallel Matrix Multiplication;System-on-Chip (SoC);SystemC","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms","matrix multiplication;network-on-chip;principal component analysis;topology","2D mesh topology;NoC topology;PCA algorithm;SystemC;hardware implementation;matrix based algorithm;matrix manipulation;matrix multiplication;mean computation;networks on chip paradigm;principal component analysis;processing element;task chain;task graph","","0","","9","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591;15301591","978-1-4244-7054-9;9781424470549","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a scalable approach inspired by the complex-adaptive control systems of social insects, such as ants and bees. These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources. This paper will provide a brief overview of the Digital Ants framework and then present results from testbed-based demonstrations that show how Digital Ants can identify a cyber security attack scenario against smart meter deployments.","","978-1-4673-4894-2;9781467348942","978-1-4673-4895-9;9781467348959","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497880","Agents;Bio-inspired;Computer security;Cyber security;Smart Grid;Smart meters","Bandwidth;Computer security;Grippers;Load flow;Smart grids;Smart meters","adaptive control;control engineering computing;mobile agents;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","bioinspired cyber security;centralized security techniques;complex-adaptive control systems;digital ant framework;digital pheromones;electric distribution systems;electric power system;interagent communication;limited computational resources;mobile agents;security risks;smart grid deployments;smart meter deployments;social insects;testbed-based demonstrations","","4","","17","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997498","CPS Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Sensory Attacks;Sensory-channel threats","Accelerometers;Malware;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","invasive software","CPS;cyber physical systems;iRobot Create;intrusion detection system;malware;novel computing paradigm;security models;sensory channel threats;sensory channels","","1","","39","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant ""convergecast"" traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates ""spatially-correlated contention."" This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.","2155-5486;21555486","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","1-4244-1268-4;1424412684","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842","","Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks","MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks","","7","","28","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692;10636692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore in this paper, in order to cope with this challenging concern, we have proposed a lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code. The primary focus is on making the algorithm lightweight so that on using it in achieving secured communication in energy starved networks like WSNs, the resource constrained nodes can successfully run the algorithm. Detailed security analysis shows that LMAC also thwarts passive attack as well as active attack. Finally the comparative usability of the MAC in the said application domain is worked out and that shows the dominance of LMAC over several state-of-the-art MACs. We claim that on an average LMAC requires 61% less overhead compared to its competitors.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417118","","Algorithm design and analysis;Authentication;Computers;Cryptography;Message authentication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;message authentication;wireless sensor networks","LMAC;WSN;lightweight hash based symmetric key message authentication code;wireless sensor network","","","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are usually deployed in unattended and harsh environments that make them susceptible for many kinds of attacks. Different security mechanisms have been proposed for WSN. Detection-based mechanisms are considered to be the second defense line against attacks when the traditional prevention based mechanisms failed to detect them. Different intrusion detection schemes have been introduced (e.g. rule based, statistical based...etc). Rule-based intrusion detection schemes are considered to be the fast and simple schemes that are suitable for the demand of WSN. However, these schemes are more specific to some kinds of attacks and cannot be generalized. In addition, these schemes cannot detect the unknown attacks that are not included in their rule base. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art rule based intrusion detection schemes and then introduce a novel framework based on rule based scheme that is able to overcome these limitations.","","978-1-4577-2154-0;9781457721540","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122778","Intrusion Detection;Rule Learning;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Collaboration;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","intrusion detection framework;rule learning;rule-based intrusion detection scheme;security issue;wireless sensor network","","1","","12","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this position paper we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the relation between some popular Android permissions and battery consumption by the device while these permissions are allowed. While battery consumption is an issue in different platforms, we chose to study this on Android because of the user's involvement in the Android permission model.

The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application.

Researchers have demonstrated successful attacks against embedded systems used in power grids, modern cars, and medical devices. This makes building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)for embedded devices a necessity. However, embedded devices have constraints(such as limited memory capacity) that make building IDSes monitoring all their security properties challenging. In this paper, we formulate building IDS for embedded systems as an optimization problem. Having the set of the security properties of the system and the invariants that verify those properties, we build an IDS that maximizes the coverage for the security properties, with respect to the available memory. This allows our IDS to be applicable to a wide range of embedded devices with different memory capacities. In our formulation users may define their own coverage criteria for the security properties. We also propose two coverage criteria and build IDSes based on them. We implement our IDSes for SegMeter, an open source smart meter. Our results show that our IDSes provide a high detection rate in spite of memory constraints of the system. Further, the detection rate of our IDSes at runtime are close to their estimated coverage at design time. This validates our approach in quantifying the coverage of our IDSes and optimizing them.","","","","10.1109/EDCC.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371950","IDS;memory constraints;selective monitoring","Buildings;Embedded systems;Hidden Markov models;Memory management;Security;Smart meters","embedded systems;optimisation;security of data;smart meters;storage management","SegMeter open source smart meter;flexible intrusion detection systems;memory-constrained embedded systems;optimization problem","","","","47","","","7-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%.

We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks.

In this paper, we present efficient schemes for analyzing and optimizing the time duration for which the intrusion detection systems need to remain active in a mobile ad hoc network. A probabilistic model is proposed that makes use of cooperation between IDSs among neighborhood nodes to reduce their individual active time. Usually, an IDS has to run all the time on every node to oversee the network behavior. This can turn out to be a costly overhead for a battery-powered mobile device in terms of power and computational resources. Hence, in this work our aim is to reduce the duration of active time of the IDSs without compromising on their effectiveness. To validate our proposed approach, we model the interactions between IDSs as a multi-player cooperative game in which the players have partially cooperative and partially conflicting goals.

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends.

It realizes pipeline operations by adjusting delay times. Implementation of fine-tuning of wave-pipelines is possible to further increase the throughput. However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times. It is the area of less than half of the logic block.","","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207067","RTL design;connection block;delay times;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);fine-tuning;low-power design;wave-pipeline","Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Routing;Switches;Throughput;Transistors;Tuning","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;logic design;pipeline processing","RTL design;delay time adjustment;field programmable gate arrays;high speed FPGA;low-power FPGA;pipeline operations;register transfer level design;wave pipeline fine tuning","","0","","13","","","24-27 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges.

The hill-climbing maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed in an energy-efficient manner to tune the input impedance of the system and guarantee adaptive maximum power transfer under wide illumination conditions. The detailed impedance tuning approach is implemented with a capacitor value modulation to eliminate the quiescent power consumption as well as to achieve a higher efficiency than the traditional pulse-frequency modulation scheme. A supercapacitor is utilized for buffering, energy storing, and filtering purposes, which enables more functions of the IOT smart nodes such as active sensing and system-on-chip (SOC) signal processing. The output voltage ranges between 3.0 and 3.5 V for different device loads, such as sensors, SOC, or wireless transceivers.

In the detection system, each node monitors its neighbors and if abnormal behavior is detected, the monitoring node will block the packets from the abnormally behaving node at the data link layer and reports to its parent node. The reporting propagates from child to parent nodes until it reaches the root. A novel control message, distress propagation object (DPO), is devised to report the anomaly to the subsequent parents and ultimately the edge-router. The DPO message is integrated to routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL).

Despite the marketing hype around “the cloud”, the paradigm itself is in a critical transition state from the laboratories to mass market. Many technical and business aspects of cloud computing need to mature before it is widely adopted for corporate use. For example, the inability to seamlessly burst between internal cloud and external cloud platforms, termed cloud bursting, is a significant shortcoming of current cloud solutions. Furthermore, the absence of a capability that would allow to broker between multiple cloud providers or to aggregate them into a composite service inhibits the free and open competition that would help the market mature. This paper describes the concepts of cloud bursting and cloud brokerage and discusses the open management and security issues associated with the two models.

Traditionally, network processor applications have been optimized for a single static workload scenario, but recently several approaches for run-time adaptation have been proposed. Comparing these approaches and developing novel run-time support algorithms is difficult due to the multicore system-on-a-chip nature of network processors. In this paper, we present a model for network processors that can aid in evaluating different run-time support systems. The model considers workload characteristics of applications and network traffic. We use a queuing network abstraction to model different runtime systems.

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference. Compared with LLF, our algorithm costs about 5% memory to get the same performance.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-4148-8;9781424441488","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425276","","Computer architecture;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Parallel processing;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web server","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;file servers;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","CMP architecture;FPGA technology;LLF algorithm;NIDS;communication overhead;flow-based load balancing;flow-based parallel processing;load balancing;multi-core system;network intrusion detection system;scheduling algorithm;web servers","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several schemes have been proposed to detect intrusions in wireless sensor networks.

Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value. It also shows performance evaluation of AODV with the enhanced secure routing algorithm and existing secure routing algorithm through simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm by considering performance metrics as Throughput, PDR and Packet loss.

However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.","1524-9050;15249050","","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2494017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328306","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs);misbehavior detection;security;trust management","Ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Security;Subspace constraints;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data privacy;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","ART scheme;VANET;access control;attack-resistant trust management scheme;confidentiality;data trust;enhanced trustworthiness;environmental protection;functional trust;integrity;interoperable wireless communication network safety;malicious attack detection;node trust;nonrepudiation;privacy protection;real-time operational constraint-demand;recommendation trust;security threats;traffic safety;vehicular ad hoc network security","","","","46","","2015-11-12","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them. The proposed technique provides data encryption using NTRU between cluster heads.","","978-1-4799-3974-9;9781479939749","","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238393","Lattice-based cryptography;Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) security;NTRU cryptosystem;efficient cluster-based routing;secure data transmission;secure message transmission","Ad hoc networks;Data communication;Encryption;Mobile computing;Polynomials","cryptography;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET topology;NTRU;Nth degree truncated polynomial ring;cluster-based routing algorithm;data encryption;lattice based secure data transmission;lattice-based cryptography;mobile ad hoc network node;radio signals;wireless communication adapter","","0","","22","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur.

We discuss the practical deployment of delay tolerant store and forward cattle monitoring architecture that provides data retention, detecting custom events, notification issuing, remote and in-situ queries answering. The core of this architecture, a novel energy efficient, disruption tolerant, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol (EERD), provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of a MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals. The energy efficiency is achieved by dynamic adaptation to the current behavior of the animals carrying the monitoring devices. We discuss the practical feasibility of this architecture by analyzing data from the extensive field experiments we performed. We address the challenges posed by the practical deployment. In particular we propose an energy efficient mechanism for dealing with disconnections and identify potential security threats that include unauthorized fabricating, changing and accessing collected measurements, as well as MANET routing attacks. Finally we propose feasible precautions against these threats and discuss their impact on our energy efficient routing protocol (EERD).","","978-1-4244-4679-7;9781424446797","978-0-7695-3750-4;9780769537504","10.1109/ICWMC.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279685","Animal Monitoring;DTN;MANET;Security;Wireless Routing","Animals;Computerized monitoring;Delay;Energy efficiency;Humans;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Profitability;Remote monitoring;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;farming;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANET routing attacks;automated animal monitoring;custom event detection;data retention;energy efficient routing protocol;energy efficient wireless devices;farming industry;large scale ad hoc animal welfare monitoring;mobile ad hoc network;notification issuance;offloading data;queries answering;security threats;store and forward cattle monitoring architecture","","1","","36","","","23-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This in turn adds a new dimension to the fragility of the network topology. Such perturbations are far more common than those found in conventional wireless networks thus, demand efficient techniques for discovering disruptive behavior in such networks. Traditional fault diagnosis techniques devised for multiprocessor systems are not directly applicable to wireless sensor networks due to their specific requirements and limitations. This survey integrates research efforts that have been produced in fault diagnosis specifically for wireless sensor networks.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores. We also present a multicore prototype implementation of the monitoring system on an FPGA platform.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682721","FPGA;data plane attack;hardware monitor;multicore processor;network infrastructure;network security","Hardware;Internet;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Program processors;Security","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;grid computing;multiprocessing systems;telecommunication network routing","FPGA platform;computer networks;data plane attacks;denial-of-service attack;field programmable gate array;hardware monitoring resource sharing;hardware monitoring systems;multicore prototype;network data plane;network processors defense mechanism;network processors protection;packet forwarding operations;router control interface;router hardware;scalable hardware monitoring grid;scalable hardware monitors;single malformed UDP packet;vulnerable packet processing software","","0","","21","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it started with data centers and battery-operated mobile devices, it has recently branched to core network devices such as routers. However, this emerging need for low-power system design has not been studied for security systems, which are becoming increasingly important today. Toward this direction, we aim to reduce the power consumption of network-level intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are used to improve the secure operation of modern computer networks. Unfortunately, traditional approaches to low-power system design, such as frequency scaling, lead to a disproportionate increase in packet processing and queuing times. In this paper, we show that this increase has a negative impact on the detection latency and impedes a timely reaction. To address this issue, we present a low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS (LEoNIDS): an architecture that resolves the energy-latency tradeoff by providing both low power consumption and low detection latency at the same time. The key idea is to identify the packets that are more likely to carry an attack and give them higher priority so as to achieve low attack detection latency. Our results indicate that LEoNIDS consumes power comparable to a state-of-the-art low-power design, while, at the same time, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster attack detection.","2168-6750;21686750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2369958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977945","Energy-Efficient Systems;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion detection systems;Low Latency;Low-Power design;Multi-Core Packet Processing;Network Security;Performance;energy-efficient systems;low latency;low-power design;multi-core packet processing;network security;performance","Computer architecture;Delays;Mobile handsets;Power demand;Program processors;Security;Time-frequency analysis","computer network security;energy conservation;low-power electronics;power aware computing;power consumption","LEoNIDS;battery-operated mobile devices;core network devices;data centers;frequency scaling;low attack detection latency;low-latency and energy-efficient NIDS;low-latency and energy-efficient network-level intrusion detection system;low-power system design;modern computer networks;packet processing;power consumption;queuing times;routers;secure operation;security systems","","0","","30","","2014-12-05","Jan.-March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy.

WSN are harmed or damaged by the Denial of Service (DoS) attack which destroy the network, resources and lose its energy rapidly. Various IDS used to detect malicious node in the network but they consume more energy to monitor malicious node, so decrease the network lifetime and throughput. It is important to form an energy efficient IDS which detect intruder accurately and consume less energy. In this paper, EEIDS (Energy Efficient Intrusion Detection Scheme) is proposed and designed, which detect malicious node based on energy consumption of nodes by comparing actual and predicted energy. The node with abnormal energy detected as malicious node. In EEIDS, Bayesian approach is used for energy prediction of sensor nodes, in which energy consumption of each sensor node is predicted using prior information and likelihood function also energy efficient approach used to reduce energy consumption of network. The simulation results show that EEIDS gives better network lifetime, throughput and energy consumption and effectively detect malicious node.","","978-1-4673-6993-0;9781467369930","","10.1109/ICACC.2015.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433787","Bayesian approach;EEIDS;IDSEP;WSN;energy consumption;energy prediction","Bayes methods;Computer crime;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;energy consumption;security of data;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS;WSN;bayesian energy prediction;denial of service attack;energy consumption;energy efficient intrusion detection scheme;malicious node;network lifetime;wireless sensor network","","","","14","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper contains a comprehensive study on the main stealth attacks that threaten CIs, with a special focus on critical information infrastructures. This type of attack is characterized by an adversary who is able to finely tune his actions to avoid detection while working toward his objectives. To provide a complete analysis of the scope and potential dangers of stealth attacks, we determine and analyze their stages and range, and we design a taxonomy to illustrate the threats to CIs, offering an overview of the applicable countermeasures against these attacks.

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path. Such type of node is continuously sending the control and data packets in the network, hindering the connection establishment. An adaptive approach is proposed which involves taking an alternate path to the destination which is less congested in order to complete the message transfer.","2347-9337;23479337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012833","Congestion;flooding;wireless network","Conferences;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trusted computing","adaptive approach;denial of service attack;distributed detection;infrastructureless wireless network;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;packet flooding;trust based transmission method","","0","","10","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA. It means that CDFA may be a more proper model for multi-pattern matching than other FAs.","1095-2055;10952055","978-1-4577-0637-0;9781457706370","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005927","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Pattern matching;Registers","optimisation;pattern matching;telecommunication security","CDFA;DFA based algorithms;Snort pattern set;high speed network;isomorphic path combination;memory usage;multipattern expression matching;network security;optimization;packet inspection;pattern sets","","0","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","0190-3918;01903918","978-1-4244-7918-4;9781424479184","978-0-7695-4157-0;9780769541570","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Pattern matching is a major task in deep packet inspection. The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7;9781424409747","978-1-4244-0975-4;9781424409754","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most previous work for key management in MANETs concentrates on the protocols and structures. How to optimally conduct node selection in ID-based cryptography with threshold secret sharing merits further investigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed scheme to dynamically select nodes with master key shares to provide the private key generation service. The proposed scheme considers the node security and energy states in the process of selecting best nodes to construct a private key generator (PKG). Intrusion detection systems are modeled as noisy sensors to monitor the system security situations. The node selection process is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","","978-1-4244-5334-4;9781424453344","978-0-7695-3823-5;9780769538235","10.1109/CSE.2009.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283067","","Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy states;Identity management systems;Identity-based encryption;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Security;Sensor systems","ad hoc networks;computer network management;cryptographic protocols;mobile computing;private key cryptography","distributed node selection;identity-based cryptography;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;node selection process;private key generation service;private key generator;protocols;stochastic optimization as problem;threshold key management","","1","","20","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efficiency of an Intrusion detection system in the case of an adhoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection. The advantage of this approach entails is the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes for reestablishing network monitors.","2154-7491;21547491","978-0-7695-3489-3;9780769534893","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737122","Adhoc Networks;Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms","Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system protection;Watches;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cellular automata;monitoring;telecommunication security","IDFADNWCA algorithm;cellular automata;distributed agent based intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;iterative power optimal solution;network-monitoring node;power level metric;wireless adhoc network","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-1456-7;9781424414567","978-1-4244-1457-4;9781424414574","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","2331-9852;23319852","978-1-4244-5175-3;9781424451753","978-1-4244-5176-0;9781424451760","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes.

Software applications frequently fail to identify so many signatures through comparisons at very high network speeds. Bloom filters are one of the main multi-hashing schemes utilized in hardware to support this level of security. Nevertheless Bloom filters consume significant power to store, retrieve and lookup virus signatures owing to many hash function computations required to index to the memory. We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware.

On the one hand, the PHEV owner needs to charge its PHEV through the grid, given possibly time-varying electricity pricing schemes. On the other hand, the energy stored in a PHEV can also be sold back to the grid so as to act as an ancillary service while possibly generating revenues to its owner. Consequently, this motivates the need to develop smart charging policies that enable the PHEV owner to optimally decide on when to charge or discharge its vehicle, while minimizing its long-term energy consumption cost. In this paper, we model this PHEV energy management problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by using a linear programming (LP) technique so as to obtain the optimal charging policy. In particular, we devise optimal charging policies that are resilient to the price information attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks and price manipulation attacks over the grid's communication network. We show that, under potential price information attacks, each PHEV can optimize its charging policies given only an estimated price information, which leads to a discrepancy between the real and expected costs. To this end, we analyze this cost difference using the proposed MDP model, which can also guide the system designer and administrator to decide whether reinforcing the system's security is required. The simulation results show that the proposed PHEV charging policy is effective and is adaptable to different PHEV mobility patterns, battery levels and varying electricity prices. It is also demonstrated that improving the system's ability to detect and resolve the attack can obviously reduce the impact brought by the attacks.","","978-1-4673-0910-3;9781467309103","978-1-4673-0909-7;9781467309097","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486015","","Batteries;Discharges (electric);Electricity;Energy consumption;Positron emission tomography;Pricing;Roads","Markov processes;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;linear programming;power engineering computing;pricing;smart power grids","DoS attacks;G2V communications;LP technique;MDP;Markov decision process;V2G communications;administrator;ancillary service;battery levels;bidirectional energy flow;denial of service attacks;energy management problem;grid communication network;grid-to-vehicle communications;linear programming technique;long-term energy consumption cost minimization;mobility patterns;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;power grids;price information attacks;price manipulation attacks;resilient PHEV charging policies;smart charging policies;smart grid;system designer;system security;time-varying electricity pricing schemes;vehicle-to-grid communications","","3","","11","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures. One processor embeds the state-of-the-art set of countermeasures and executes the application code. The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor. We show that our approach enables the secure circuit's designer to easily fine tune the strategy of security, for example, of Pay-TV applications and could, in the future, be used to optimise dynamically the trade-off between performance and security.","2157-4952;21574952","978-1-4244-8705-9;9781424487059","978-1-4244-8703-5;9781424487035","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5721145","","Cryptography;Hardware;Monitoring;Sensors;Smart cards;Software","embedded systems;security of data;software architecture","complex strategy;countermeasure centered approach;double processor architecture;intrusion detection system;secret information recovery;secure embedded system","","0","","9","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.","1930-529X;1930529X","978-1-4244-5636-9;9781424456369","978-1-4244-5637-6;9781424456376","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235","","Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols","Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes","DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol","","21","","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive “attack tree” that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks. We also suggest that the widest coverage in monitoring the attacks can be provided by a hybrid sensing infrastructure that uses both a centralized intrusion detection system and embedded meter sensors.","","978-1-4673-0910-3;9781467309103","978-1-4673-0909-7;9781467309097","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486016","","Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mesh networks;Monitoring;Routing;Sensors","metering;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","AMI threat analysis;advanced metering infrastructures;attack detection;attack tree;centralized intrusion detection system;common attack techniques;comprehensive intrusion detection solution;embedded meter sensors;hybrid sensing infrastructure;mesh networks;smart meters","","13","","14","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although this approach works well in some scenarios, some nodes may not be able to afford the periodical trust update due to the limited resources in energy and computation power. To avoid energy depletion and extend the network lifetime, trust-based security schemes need approaches to update the trust taking into account the network conditions at each node. At the same time, a trade-off in terms of packet loss rate, false positives, detection rate, and energy of nodes is needed for network performance. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of trust update frequency on energy consumption and packet loss rate. We then identify network parameters, such as packet transmission rate, packet loss rate, remaining node energy, and rate of link changes, and leverage these parameters to design an Adaptive Trust Update Frequency scheme that takes into account runtime network conditions. The evaluation of our prototype shows significant improvements in the tradeoff between energy saving and packet loss rate over traditional fixed-frequency approaches.","","","","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384288","","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Packet loss;Security","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;adaptive trust update frequency;energy consumption;energy depletion;energy saving;packet loss rate;packet transmission rate;remaining node energy;runtime network conditions;trust-based security schemes;trustworthiness","","","","19","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection Scheme for Hierarchical WSNs","A. Al-Riyami; N. Zhang; J. Keane","School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, U.K.","IEEE Access","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Node compromise attacks pose a serious threat to WSNs. To launch an attack, an adversary physically captures a node and access data or software stored on the node. Even worse, the adversary may redeploy the captured node back into the network and use it to launch further attacks. To reduce the impact of a node compromise attack on network operations, the network should detect a node compromise as early as possible, ideally soon after a node is being captured, and then isolate the node from future network communications. Solutions for early node compromise detection are based on distributed monitoring of neighbouring nodes’ aliveness. Nodes regularly send notification (Heartbeat) messages to their one-hop neighbors to indicate their aliveness. If no message is received from a node (i.e., if a node is not heard) for a certain period of time, then the unheard node is said to have been compromised. This approach may have a large number of false positive errors when the message loss ratio in the network is high, as missing messages could be caused by message loss during transmission, in addition to node compromises. This paper proposes a novel scheme, called an Adaptive Early Node Compromise Detection (AdaptENCD) scheme, to facilitate node compromise attack detection in a cluster-based WSN. The scheme is designed to achieve a low false positive ratio in the presence of various levels of message loss ratios. To achieve this feature, two ideas are used in the design. The first is to use cluster-based collective decision making to detect node compromises. The second is to dynamically adjust the rate of notification message transmissions in response to the message loss ratio in the sender’s neighborhood. The performance of the scheme, in terms of false positive ratio, false negative ratio and transmission overheads, is evaluated using simulation. The results are compared against those from the most relevant scheme in the literature. The comparison results show- that our scheme can detect all the node compromises in the network more effectively and efficiently, regardless of the message loss ratio in the underlying environment.","2169-3536;21693536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2594478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530851","Node compromise attack;Wireless Sensor Networks;adaptive;detection","Adaptation models;Network security;Propagation losses;Telecommunication network management;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","2016-08-03","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2305;21572305","978-1-4673-1788-7;9781467317887","","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Adaptive software;Assets;Smart grid","Buildings;Cameras;Energy management;Home appliances;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","asset variability;customer domain;engineering adaptive security requirement;monitoring function;primary assets;secondary assets;security control;security countermeasures;smart grid;valuable asset management","","2","","8","","","4-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable.

Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis.

And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably. Analyzed by XPower, which offered by Xilinx Inc., our approach is able to save dynamic power consumption by1.7 times comparing to traditional approaches on Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device.","","978-1-4577-1006-3;9781457710063","978-0-7695-4466-3;9780769544663","10.1109/GreenCom.2011.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061325","FPGA;NFA;power efficient accelerator;regular expression matching","Clocks;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic gates;Pattern matching;Radiation detectors;Random access memory","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","PeRex;Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device;XPower;Xilinx Inc;dynamic power consumption;power efficient FPGA-based architecture;power efficient regular expression matching architecture;string pattern matching","","2","","19","","","4-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes are deployed randomly over an area in order to sense various physical phenomena related parameters. The nodes sense the data within their vicinity and forward the data to the neighboring nodes so as to forward the data towards the base station. However, there may be few malicious nodes present in the network and these nodes falsify the data while communicating. This results in false information gathered by the base station and also exhausting the energy of the nodes in the path. Due to the presence of these untrusted nodes the security of the WSN application is compromised as the false data results in distorted information. So it is necessary to study a trust model, various security threats and their effect on WSN. Trust is essential among the nodes in the WSN so that the data can be forwarded without being modified or distorted. This work examines malicious node attack in the WSN scenario and the energy consumption.

Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices.

However, TCAM is not well-suited to the long (in bits) and sparse rules used for running advanced applications that require complicated classification.

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions.

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate a distributed voting-based intrusion detection protocol for GCSs in multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks and examine the effect of intrusion detection on system survivability measured by the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) metric and efficiency measured by the communication cost metric. We identify optimal design settings under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the communication cost metric or vice versa.","1530-2075;15302075","978-1-4244-3751-1;9781424437511","978-1-4244-3750-4;9781424437504","10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161247","","Communication system security;Costs;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Time measurement","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;multicast protocols;security of data","distributed intrusion detection protocols;mean time to security failure;mobile group communication systems;multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks","","0","","15","","","23-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IoT can be considered as the set of technologies that allow small devices e.g. sensors, which constitute wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that perform specific tasks, to communicate over the Internet Protocol (IP). Cellular networks, especially LTE, are an attractive technology to provide Internet connectivity to these potentially remote devices. In order to allow the cellular networks to connect these devices reliably to the Internet, the traffic of WSNs should be studied to understand their unique requirements on the cellular infrastructure. This is because the existing cellular networks have been traditionally designed mainly to support human to human communication in which case the traffic is completely different than that of WSNs. This paper aims to shed some light on the possible integration challenges that are imposed by the integration of WSNs and LTE which manifest themselves in the difference in traffic characteristics. We perform some experiments to explore the behavior of specific WSN application traffic. We then discuss the possible adaptation that is required for the successfully integration of the two technologies.","","978-0-7695-5159-3;9780769551593","","10.1109/MSN.2013.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726350","Internet of Things;LTE;M2M communication;WSN","IP networks;Internet;Logic gates;Media Access Protocol;Sensors;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","4G mobile communication;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;cellular radio;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Internet protocol;LTE;WSN application traffic characterization;cellular infrastructure;cellular networks;human to human communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","28","","","11-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes in a wireless sensor network are grouped into clusters based on the special relationships with a cluster head in each cluster. The proposed scheme firstly uses a clustering algorithm to build a model of normal traffic behavior, and then uses this model of normal traffic to detect abnormal traffic patterns. According to the different network conditions of clusters, this scheme also can dynamically set different detection parameters for different clusters to achieve a more appropriate detection algorithm. The performance analysis shows that the proposed intrusion detection scheme can improve the detection accuracy and drop the false positive rate, and is highly efficient of the energy conservation.","2154-4824;21544824","978-1-4673-4497-5;9781467344975","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6321069","Anomaly detection;Ddynamic intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","0","","9","","","24-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X;0743166X","978-1-4244-5836-3;9781424458363","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users’ private lives. In addition, this might enable pervasive observation or imitation of one’s movements and activities, such as sending messages to contacts, accessing private communication, shopping with a credit card, and relaying information about where one has been.

Some of the inspections one may make look for consistency with respect to data available only at the application layer, requiring one to position the analysis high in the protocol stack. Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policy engine is able to accurately distinguish between legitimate traffic and malware bearing traffic.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688003","","Encryption;Engines;Entropy;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","metering;power meters;power system security;protocols","AMI application layer;AMI control traffic;AMI protocol;advanced metering infrastructure;data payloads;deep packet inspection;malware propagation;multistage analysis;policy engine","","2","","25","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT.

However, sensor nodes are inherently limited by insufficient resources such as energy, storage and communication. Therefore, designing an effective key management mechanism in WSNs has become an important issue. In this paper, a lightweight and scalable key management scheme for heterogeneous sensor networks is proposed. The scheme is based on Exclusion Basis System (EBS) for scalability and simple symmetric cryptographic primitives with low computational requirements. It provides periodic or on demand key refreshment and node authentication to improve the security of the network. In addition, it is highly efficient in terms of key refreshment and node revocation. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has less energy consumption in key refreshment phase and has stronger network resilience against node capture than several existing schemes.","","978-1-4673-1183-0;9781467311830","","10.1109/BMEI.2012.6513216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513216","exclusion basis system;internet of things;key management;security;wireless sensor networks","","authorisation;cryptography;wireless sensor networks","EBS;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;exclusion basis system;heterogeneous sensor networks;key management scheme;low computational requirements;network resilience;node authentication;node revocation;on demand key refreshment;periodic key refreshment;sensor nodes;sensor technology;symmetric cryptographic primitives","","0","","16","","","16-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Smart grids are quickly spawning in Australia, Europe and North America. Security in smart grids is imperative to protect the functionality of their underlying networks, the data they communicate and the privacy of their customers. However, few research efforts have focussed on security in this area and solutions adopted from traditional ad-hoc networks are not suitable, as they would need to be fully integrated with the grid and its legacy systems before they can yield positive results. The purpose of this paper is dual; to review matters of smart grid security and to examine the effect of hacker attacks on smart grid network parameters. Through simulation we investigate how malicious activity targeting the routing layer of smart grid networks can interrupt network effectiveness.","","978-3-8008-3426-9;9783800834269","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216815","","Logic gates;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","","","","18-20 April 2012","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy. Simulation results manifest that the proposed schemes offer significant energy efficiency and highlight their flexibility.","0018-9545;00189545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2217387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296725","Channel awareness;energy efficiency;opportunistic transmission scheduling;optimal stopping","Data communication;Energy consumption;Minimization;Quality of service;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer power supplies;energy consumption;minimisation;stochastic processes;wireless channels","battery lifetime;channel-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling;communication energy consumption;data transmission;distributed scheduler;energy efficiency;energy-efficient wireless link;minimization approach;optimal stopping theory;power level;stochastic characteristic;terminal device;time scheduling strategy;transmission energy consumption;transmission power consumption;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless device","","9","","32","","2012-09-06","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we propose an approach to enhance the security of embedded systems. In this approach SPUMONE, a thin virtualization layer, is selected to build a multi-OS environment for its low overhead. Xv6 runs as trusted OS for executing the monitoring service that detects the violation of the integrity of the Linux kernel while Linux as a general purpose OS. The monitoring service checks whether Linux is compromised or not. A secure pager that offers the spatial isolation based on the core-local memory is proposed to protect the integrity of the xv6 kernel located in the main memory, which can make Linux and xv6 run in high security level.","2325-1271;23251271","978-1-4577-1118-3;9781457711183","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029887","embedded system;security;virtualization","Embedded systems;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Random access memory;Security;Virtual machine monitors","Linux;multiprocessing systems;security of data","SPUMONE;core-local memory;embedded Linux;embedded systems;multicore processor;security requirements;virtualization layer","","2","","10","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
